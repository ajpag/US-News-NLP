""The acquisitions are the latest in a string of deals moving North Sea assets from oil majors to smaller groups, and Premier said the deals would generate more than $1 billion in free cash flow by the end of 2023, boost its output to more than 100,000 boed and add 82 million barrels of reserves and resources to its portfolio."", ""Its shares were up by around 17% at 118.5 pence by 1207 GMT, after hitting 120.70, their highest in over a year."", ""The deals would be backdated to January 2019, shaving off Premier’s access to cash flow for the period until the deal closes, but also depressing the actual price it expects to pay to around $500 million."",

It is quietly building up the firepower of its secret weapon: data."", ""The company, whose couriers’ orange backpacks have become familiar features of cities like São Paulo, Bogota and Mexico City, has yet to make a cent of profit after five years."", 
""However, three executives told Reuters that, behind the scenes, Rappi was gathering shopper and sales data that is coveted by consumer brands ranging from food group Nestle NESN.S to beermaker Anheuser-Busch InBev ABI.BR, as well as restaurants, supermarkets and stores."", ""The company’s rapid expansion could be a high-risk strategy, though, and relies on keeping cash flowing from investors until profits materialize."", ""“Part of the vision of Rappi is to build an ecosystem,” 35-year-old co-founder Mejia told Reuters in an interview. “It’s much more than a delivery company.”"", 
""The startup, which is valued at an estimated $3.5 billion and backed by Japan's SoftBank 9984.T, has swept across nine countries since 2015. It delivers everything from groceries and restaurant food to medication and furniture, and has branched out into scooter rental, travel and basic banking services."", ""Every transaction generates data about shoppers such as where they live, what they want and when they need it. Rappi is looking to lure more and more people to the app, a move that would further enrich its data."", 
""Rappi does not hand over individual customer data to its merchants but instead looks at shopping trends, Mejia said."", ""The firm next plans to push into more cities across Latin America that have at least 500,000 people, while working on adding more digital banking services, added Mejia, who is from Colombia. The startup has yet to expand deeply into Central America."", ""‘VERY EARLY IN THE GAME’"", ""Gabriel Simões, tech research analyst at Itaú BBA in São Paulo, said the jury was out on Rappi’s plan to launch a swathe of services at once in its bid to quickly gain users, rather than focusing on just one core offering, like bringing you lunch."", 
""“They’re trying to try to lock more users into their platform,” he added. “It could play out well. But it’s very early in the game to make sure this is the best strategy or not.”"", ""It’s not going to be easy; Rappi faces stiff competition in Latin American deliveries from global players Uber and Didi Chuxing, as well as a host of local apps like iFood and Cornershop, all trying to eat each other’s lunch."", ""Rappi has an average of more than 10 million active users monthly, according to research firm Apptopia, and says it provides deliveries for almost 100,000 businesses."", 
""Some industry experts raised concerns about the startup’s high cash burn and need for fresh funding to maintain its growth. They said Rappi may find it difficult to wean users off the big discounts and promotions it is offering to win them over, which can hinder profitability."", ""A lunchtime delivery of soup, tacos and a burrito in Mexico City may cost 319 pesos ($16.80), for example, but can end up at just 40 pesos after factoring in offers. Rappi also sends coupons via text, offering deals like 30% off alcohol between 5 and 11 p.m."", 
""Some merchants, meanwhile, said they were reluctant to rely too heavily on Rappi in case the startup failed and that they were looking at developing their own delivery apps."", ""‘NO CHOICE BUT TO KEEP GROWING’"", ""SoftBank invested close to $1 billion in Rappi last April, making the app its biggest bet in Latin America. There is pressure on the Japanese investor to make Rappi a success following steep losses at two of its other big investments, WeWork and Uber."", ""SoftBank declined to comment on Rappi’s strategy."", 
""Rappi’s data can help consumer brands as well as the restaurants and grocery stores that sell directly on the platform, according to Luis Techera, head of strategic partnerships for the app in Mexico."", ""If Gillette, for example, wants to launch a new razor, it can have Rappi send 100,000 samples to people aged between 27 and 35 years old who live in certain neighborhoods."", ""“Rappi can deliver them in a week to all the users who already bought a Gillette razor, and that’s an attack that nobody has,” Techera said."", 
""Nestle credited Rappi’s data for allowing it to analyze shopping habits, from groceries and pharmacies to restaurants."", ""“Rappi has no choice but to keep growing. We see Rappi as a vehicle that will keep helping the development of e-commerce for groceries,” said Luis Macin, Nestle’s vice president of e-commerce in Mexico."", ""Asked how soon Rappi would turn a profit, Mejia said his priority was to grow fast, and that investors were on board with the plan."", ""“I want to get to as many consumers as possible,” he said. “I’d rather invest in that than focus on short-term goals or short-term profitability.”"", 
""Hendrick Lee, managing partner of Palm Drive Capital which has invested in Rappi, said the startup’s spending made sense in its quest to attract the masses."", ""“I understand why Rappi is burning large amounts of money to get there,” he added."", ""($1 = 18.9700 Mexican pesos)"

To try to curb infection rates, the Chinese government has implemented social distancing policies which have substantially slowed business activity in the region. Other countries are increasingly implementing ad hoc measures, including travel restrictions and quarantine measures, to prevent an outbreak from occurring in their respective jurisdictions."", 
""Developments are unfolding at an accelerated pace and organizations have much ground to cover in BCPs. The maintenance of operational agility, succession planning and employee morale are just some of the main considerations at play."", ""In mainland China, the Chinese government has extended the Chinese New Year holiday through February 2, to encourage social distancing to mitigate the spread of the virus. Provincial and national regulators have issued guidance for employers regarding employee rights and entitlements to remuneration during this time. Uncertainty regarding the interpretation of these regulatory notices has caused confusion over whether some business continuity practices, such as requesting employees to use vacation days during the extended holiday, are legal."", 
""Enterprise Singapore, a government agency, has issued a guide{here} on business continuity planning for the novel coronavirus. The guide recommends that businesses appoint a designated manager to oversee coronavirus-related business continuity measures. The importance of succession planning for key personnel in addition to senior managers, including communications, human resources and operations staff is heavily emphasized. Businesses are also advised to establish alternate teams for critical operational functions and to keep these teams physically segregated at all times."", 
""In practice, segregating teams may require businesses to place extensive restrictions on employees, even outside working hours. For example, the South China Morning Post, an English language newspaper in Hong Kong, established separate workspaces for alternate teams in different districts of the city during a regional outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003. Alternate teams were sent to work in different locations and were prohibited from having any physical contact with members of the other team during and after work hours for a period of three months."", 
""Many companies in Hong Kong have activated extensive BCPs for the novel coronavirus in comparison to jurisdictions with similar numbers of confirmed cases, partially due to containment measures from the local government, lessons learned during the SARs outbreak and the region’s close proximity to mainland China. Measures that have been implemented include remote working arrangements for a large percentage of the workforce. Some companies have provided personal protection supplies such as surgical masks and hand disinfectant for employees who have to come to the office to perform their job duties. Policies suspending business travel to cluster areas for the coronavirus have been implemented by numerous businesses. Some organizations have even sought to prohibit employee personal travel to cluster areas."", 
""In comparison, there have been fewer reports of companies in South Korea, Japan or Thailand implementing business continuity measures such as asking employees to work from home or limiting employee travel."", ""In Canada, some businesses have begun to execute pandemic preparedness measures such as training staff on what to do if they encounter someone who is ill, or if a customer-facing employee should fall ill at work. Local disaster management experts have expressed concern that some organizations, especially smaller firms, may lack the adequate resources or expertise to put measures in place that can effectively deal with employee health and operational risks posed by the novel coronavirus."", 
""Internationally, businesses are struggling with disruptions to their supply chains in China{here}, where manufacturing and logistics activity has slowed to a crawl across the country. Technology companies are expected to be most affected; however, many other commodities, goods and services will also be significantly affected. Companies such as H&M, Japan Airlines, Baidu Inc, McDonald's and Tesla have all recently warned that the outbreak in China will have an impact on their businesses."", ""BCP for the novel coronavirus is proving to be difficult, requiring businesses to consider operational and financial risks alongside health risks to one of their most valuable assets: talent. Safeguarding the wellbeing of employees plays an important role in keeping a company operational during this uncertain time. While practices implemented by companies have delved into infection control measures such as personal hygiene and social distancing, challenges in maintaining employee morale have not been discussed with the same fervor."", 
""Some important issues to consider in BCPs include how to handle fear and xenophobia that have arisen due to concerns over the novel coronavirus. BCP designated personnel need to consider how to manage anxiety in the workplace, even over scenarios that would be benign during normal times, such as an employee who shows up to work with a minor cough."", ""Businesses that choose to implement work from home arrangements for large swathes of the workforce will need to consider how to help employees who are not accustomed to working remotely stay motivated during this time, alongside infrastructure concerns such as bandwidth and capacity issues for remote access of work servers, conferencing lines and other necessities."", 
""Moreover, managers must consider how to balance their legal responsibility to treat all employees fairly against any measures the company may have to take to mitigate the risk of widespread infection at their firms. Consideration for the mental wellbeing of employees needs to be factored in alongside practices to safeguard their physical health against illness."", ""Planning for an extended and uncertain period time in which businesses may have to run on contingency measures is another significant consideration for businesses. The novel coronavirus remains somewhat of a mystery. Health agencies are in the midst of containment efforts; however, it is uncertain how long these initiatives may take to bring regional outbreaks under control, or if these initiatives will be successful at all in preventing more widespread infection. As a result, businesses must examine how they will function under different scenarios and at varying percentages of operational capacity. Critical tasks will have to be identified and many organizations will have to make tough decisions weighing risk against productivity just in order to stay afloat."",

The federal government has less than 10% of the protective masks required to protect healthcare workers and the public. And Washington still does not have adequate funding in place to support health departments’ efforts, though more money is on the way."", 
""Conflicting messaging from the White House and top U.S. officials regarding the severity of the threat has only added to the uncertainty."", ""The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) this week for the first time advised American businesses, schools, hospitals and families to prepare for domestic acceleration of the virus, which has infected more than 80,000 people worldwide and killed nearly 3,000."", ""President Donald Trump on Wednesday assured Americans that the risk of coronavirus transmission in the United States was “very low.” Despite an explosion of cases in China over the past two months, the Trump administration only this week put in a request for $2.5 billion to aid in the response, an amount both Republicans and Democrats have said is too small."", 
""Critics of the federal response say the United States squandered precious weeks by focusing too narrowly on keeping the coronavirus from crossing U.S. borders rather than marshalling resources to prepare American communities for a widespread domestic outbreak that officials now say was inevitable."", ""“This has been a realistic risk for a month, and the signal to trigger that kind of preparedness has only been going out in the last few days in an explicit way,” said Jeremy Konyndyk, a senior policy fellow at the Center for Global Development in Washington. “That’s a huge problem.”"", 
""There are 60 confirmed U.S. cases of the novel coronavirus, which causes the disease known as Covid-19, U.S. health officials said on Wednesday. But experts admit they have no way of knowing the true figure because access to testing at present is severely limited."", ""So far, the U.S. strategy has focused almost exclusively on testing infected travelers, using a test that looks for genetic material from the virus in saliva or mucus. As of February 23, fewer than 500 people from 43 states had been or are being tested for the virus."", 
""Currently, just seven state and local health departments have the ability to screen for the virus, the Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL) said on Wednesday. CDC-developed tests issued three weeks ago were producing inaccurate results in some labs, so new tests had to be made and cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), leaving many labs with no local testing capability, the group said."", ""The CDC and FDA have worked out a fix that will allow 40 more public health labs to do testing by the end of next week, the APHL’s Chief Executive Scott Becker told Reuters."", 
""In the meantime, the burden has fallen largely on the CDC, which does testing for most of the country on its campus in Atlanta."", ""“Unfortunately, we are now in the bottom tier in countries capable of doing population-based testing,” said Dr. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota."", ""U.S. patients typically wait 24 to 48 hours to find out whether they have tested positive and need to be quarantined, health officials said, during which time those who are infected can spread the virus to others"", 
""The CDC’s test is restricted solely for use by public health labs, but if the virus begins spreading widely in the United States, hospitals will need to be able to do the tests themselves, public health experts say. Such testing is typically done using kits produced by commercial companies. Several privately developed tests are in the works, but none have yet won approval from the FDA."", ""Some health experts also fault the narrow testing criteria that the United States is using to screen for potential infections. Currently, individuals with flu-like symptoms are only tested for the coronavirus if they have traveled to a country where the virus is spreading. This has raised concerns that there are far more cases in the United States than are currently recorded."", 
""“If the majority of testing is all around airports or travelers, we won’t know whether it’s circulating in communities,” said Dr. Tom Inglesby, director of the Center for Health Security of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health."", ""Those worries were reinforced on Wednesday when the CDC confirmed the first U.S. case of coronavirus in a California patient with no apparent travel history. The University of California Davis said in a statement the patient was transferred to the hospital with severe pneumonia and the hospital requested testing. But since the patient didn’t fit the CDC’s criteria, those tests were delayed by several days."", 
""On Thursday, CDC said it is broadening those criteria to allow testing when the virus is suspected."", ""Around 15 state health departments contacted by Reuters raised concerns about challenges they would face in the event of community spread, including worries about not having enough personal protective gear to safeguard frontline medical workers."", ""The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on Tuesday estimated that the United States would need 300 million face masks to protect healthcare workers and the public from people infected with the virus. The country has fewer than 20 million of the kind of masks needed to protect healthcare workers in the Strategic National Stockpile, a government repository of medical supplies needed to address public health emergencies."", 
""“There is a real concern the availability of this equipment may be limited, in part because of the public buying it in a panic when they don’t need it,” said Matt Zavadsky, head of the National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians."", ""President Donald Trump’s administration is considering invoking special powers through a law called the Defense Production Act to quickly expand domestic manufacturing of protective masks and clothing to combat the coronavirus in the United States, two U.S. officials told Reuters."", 
""With no Covid-19 vaccine or proven anti-viral medicine available, states are planning to isolate sick people in their homes, both to slow community spread and reduce pressure on hospitals, according to the CDC."", ""Their ability to track a rapidly expanding web of patients who test positive, and all the people with whom they have had contact, is of major concern, according to chief epidemiologists in several states."", ""Health departments in some states have purchased disease surveillance software to help them with that task. The state of Washington’s system, for instance, tracks patients and people they have had contact with, and asks them about their condition. If someone reports symptoms that merit hospitalization, the patient and doctors are informed of that."", 
""The CDC said in a news conference on Tuesday that transmission of the virus could be slowed by the closure of schools and businesses and the cancellations of concerts and other mass gatherings."", ""But exactly who would make those decisions or how they would be enforced isn’t clear and could vary widely throughout the nation."", ""In Texas, for example, such decisions may be made by local officials, said Chris Van Deus, a spokesman with the Texas health department."", ""“Texas is a home rule state so the buck really stops with county judges and mayors,” Van Deus said."", 
""Another concern is a flood of patients into health systems that are already overburdened in many parts of the country, particularly during winter flu season."", ""Washington state is considering temporary drive-through care facilities to stop potential coronavirus carriers entering healthcare facilities, mindful that hospitals can amplify outbreaks, as was the case with the viruses that cause MERS and SARS."", ""New Mexico is working with healthcare systems to turn outpatient facilities into care units if needed, said State Epidemiologist Michael Landen."", 
""“The biggest challenge is getting a consistent message to the public with respect to their options with dealing with this virus,” Landen said."

This followed reports in China that discharged patients throughout the country were testing positive after their release from the hospital."", 
""An official at China’s National Health Commission said on Friday that such patients have not been found to be infectious."", ""Experts say there are several ways discharged patients could fall ill with the virus again. Convalescing patients might not build up enough antibodies to develop immunity to SARS-CoV-2, and are being infected again. The virus also could be “biphasic”, meaning it lies dormant before creating new symptoms."", ""But some of the first cases of “reinfection” in China have been attributed to testing discrepancies."", 
""On Feb. 21, a discharged patient in the southwestern Chinese city of Chengdu was readmitted 10 days after being discharged when a follow-up test came back positive."", ""Lei Xuezhong, the deputy director of the infectious diseases center at the West China Hospital, told People’s Daily that hospitals were testing nose and throat samples when deciding whether patients should be discharged, but new tests were finding the virus in the lower respiratory tract."", ""Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at Britain’s University of East Anglia who has been closely following the outbreak, told Reuters that although the patient in Osaka could have relapsed, it is also possible that the virus was still being released into her system from the initial infection, and she wasn’t tested properly before she was discharged."", 
""The woman first tested positive in late January and was discharged from the hospital on Feb. 1, leading some experts to speculate that it was biphasic, like anthrax."", ""A Journal of the American Medical Association study of four infected medical personnel treated in Wuhan, the epicenter of the epidemic, said it was likely that some recovered patients would remain carriers even after meeting discharge criteria."", ""In China, for instance, patients must test negative, show no symptoms and have no abnormalities on X-rays before they are discharged."", 
""Allen Cheng, professor of infectious diseases epidemiology at Monash University in Melbourne, said it wasn’t clear whether the patients were re-infected or had remained “persistently positive” after their symptoms disappeared. But he said the details of the Japan case suggested the patient had been reinfected."", ""Song Tie, vice director of the local disease control center in southern China’s Guangdong province, told a media briefing on Wednesday that as many as 14% of discharged patients in the province have tested positive again and had returned to hospitals for observation."", 
""He said one good sign is that none of those patients appear to have infected anyone else."", ""“From this understanding ... after someone has been infected by this kind of virus, he will produce antibodies, and after these antibodies are produced, he won’t be contagious,” he said."", ""Normally, convalescing patients will develop specific antibodies that render them immune to the virus that infected them, but reinfection is not impossible, said Adam Kamradt-Scott, a specialist in infectious diseases at the University of Sydney."", 
""“In most cases though, because their body has developed an immune response to the first infection, the second infection is usually less severe,” Kamradt-Scott said."", ""Other experts have also raised the possibility of “antibody-dependent enhancement”, which means exposure to viruses might make patients more at risk of further infections and worse symptoms."", ""China has so far discharged 36,117 patients, according to data from the National Health Commission released on Friday, which represents almost 46% of the total cases on the Chinese mainland. If the 14% rate of reinfection is accurate and remains consistent, it could pose a wider health risk."", 
""“I would say that it is less about if it is possible that re-infection can occur than how often it occurs,” Cheng said."

Contact with fecal matter from an infected person may also transmit the virus."", ""The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says it may be possible for a person to become infected by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose or eyes."", 
""An analysis of 22 earlier studies of similar coronaviruses, including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) published online this month in the Journal of Hospital Infection, concluded that human coronaviruses can remain infectious on inanimate surfaces for up to nine days at room temperature. However, they can quickly be rendered inactive using common disinfectants, and may also dissipate at higher temperatures, the authors wrote. It is not yet clear, however, whether the new coronavirus behaves in a similar way."", 
""“On copper and steel it’s pretty typical, it’s pretty much about two hours,” CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield told U.S. lawmakers on Thursday, referring to how long the new coronavirus may be active on those types of materials. “But I will say on other surfaces - cardboard or plastic - it’s longer, and so we are looking at this.”"", ""The agency said there is likely a very low risk of spread from products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient temperatures."", ""A CDC spokeswoman, in an emailed statement, said the agency is still looking into how contagious the virus can be when deposited on more common, everyday surfaces."", 
""The Food and Drug Administration this week said it has no evidence that COVID-19 has been transmitted from imported goods, but the situation remains “dynamic” and the agency said it will assess and update guidance as needed."", ""“The important big take-home message is that this is probably a small proportion of the transmission of respiratory viruses,” said Dr. Timothy Brewer, professor of epidemiology and medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles. “Out in the community, these viruses are probably not surviving for a long time on surfaces.”"", 
""Brewer explained that such viruses tend to survive the longest in low-temperature, low-humidity environments, “that is why you see lots of respiratory viruses during the winter.”"

The widely circulated photo of Koontz’s book page includes some highlighted text reading: “They call the stuff ‘Wuhan-400’ because it was developed at their RDNA labs outside of the city of Wuhan, and It was the four-hundredth viable strain of man-made microorganisms created at that research center”."", 
""Some claims circulating also include an additional page that mentions the year 2020 and the outbreak of a “severe pneumonia-like illness”."", ""This is partly false. While it is true that Koontz wrote about a fictional virus in his novel and that its name “Wuhan-400” refers the Chinese city in which the 2019 Coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19) (here) actually started, the illness in his book doesn’t share more traits with COVID-19."", ""In his novel, Koontz described “Wuhan-400” as “China’s most important and dangerous: new biological weapon in a decade”. He also wrote it was developed by labs outside of the city of Wuhan."", 
""There is no proof that the new coronavirus was created in a lab. The virus is believed to have originated late last year in a food market in Wuhan that was illegally selling wildlife (see here). Health experts think it may have originated in bats and then passed to humans, possibly via another species."", ""Reuters looked at further references of “Wuhan-400” in Koontz’s book."", ""The symptoms and behavior of Koontz’s “Wuhan-400” are very different to COVID-19. In the novel, the virus has an incubation period of “only four hours”. COVID-19’s incubation period is between 1-14 days. According to World Health Organization (here), the most common incubation time is around five days."", 
""Koontz also describes “Wuhan-400” as a disease with a “kill-rate” of a 100%. “Once infected, no one lives more than twenty-four hours. Most die in twelve”, he writes. COVID-19’s death rate is far from this, according to the WHO, the case-fatality rate is between 2% and 4% in Wuhan and 0.7% outside Wuhan (here)."", ""The symptoms described by Koontz are different to COVID-19. In his novel, “Wuhan-400” causes the secretion of a “toxin that literally eats away brain tissue” causing loss of control of bodily function. “The victim simply ceases to have a pulse, functioning organs, or any urge to breathe”, writes Koontz. Meanwhile COVID-19 infections have a wide range of symptoms, including fever, coughing, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. Mild cases can cause cold-like symptoms, while severe cases can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory illness, kidney failure and death."", 
""In the novel, “Wuhan-400” is described to be “infinitely worse” than Ebola (EVD), but COVID-19 is less threatening than EVD. According to the WHO, the average EVD case fatality rate is around 50%, while case fatality rates have varied from 25% to 90% in past outbreaks (see here). The new coronavirus death-rate is between 2% and 4% in Wuhan and 0.7% outside Wuhan."", ""It is worth noting that in the first edition of “The Eyes of Darkness” in 1981, the fictional virus was not named after the Chinese city, but after a Russian locality named “Gorki” (Gorki-400). In the original version of the novel, the virus was developed outside of “Gorki” and it was meant to be the “Soviet’s most important, dangerous new biological weapon in the decade”. This is confirmed by a Google Books’ search of the word “Wuhan” in the 1981 edition (here). In this edition “Wuhan-400” brings no results."", 
""According to the South China Morning Post, the name of the virus was changed on the re-release of the book in 1989, toward the end of the Cold War. Their article here includes photographs of the previous edition that references “Gorki-400”). In this edition, Koontz also published his novel under his real name instead of using his pseudonym “Leigh Nichols”."", ""Reuters tried to contact the author and the publisher but is yet to receive an answer."", ""Some of the posts on social media also share a third image of a book page without any attribution (here), wrongly suggesting it is part of the same book. This page reads: “In around 2020 a severe pneumonia-like illness will spread throughout the globe, attacking the lungs and the bronchial tubes and resisting all known treatments”."", 
""This page does not belong to “The Eyes of Darkness”. It comes from the 2008 book “End Of Days: Predictions and prophecies about the end of the world” by Sylvia Browne, an American author who claimed to be a psychic (see the page here)."", ""This claim is therefore partly false. Dean Koontz did write about a fictional virus called “Wuhan-400” in the 1989 re-release of his 1981 novel “The Eyes of Darkness”, but symptoms and effects of the disease do not match the official description of COVID-19. The additional page present in some claims suggesting an outbreak “around 2020” is from a different book."", 
""Partly false: Dean Kootz wrote about a fictional virus called “Wuhan-400”, but its description has nothing to do with the new coronavirus."

In part it’s because not every single case will be detected - some will be so mild they never get noticed. And in part it’s because there can be a significant time lag between when someone is infected and when or if they die."", 
""“What you can safely say is that if you divide the number of reported deaths by the number of reported cases, you will almost certainly get the wrong answer,” said John Edmunds, a professor at the center for mathematical modeling of infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine."", ""That’s why World Health Organization (WHO) officials - who said last week that 3.4% of the people worldwide confirmed as having been infected with the new coronavirus had died - were careful not to describe that as a mortality rate or death rate."", 
""“In an unfolding epidemic, it can be misleading to look at the naïve estimate of deaths so far divided by cases so far,” said Christl Donnelly, a disease specialist at Oxford University and Imperial College London. “This is due to the delay from the time it takes for individuals to progress from being diagnosed as cases to dying.”"", ""With COVID-19 - the infection caused by the new coronavirus - the time between onset of disease and death is fairly significant, at around two to three weeks or more."", 
""So the sum involved would need to compare the number of deaths at a given point with the actual case numbers from some weeks beforehand."

""The image further claims: \""The vaccine will contain the virus. If you get vaccinated, you might become infected with the virus.\"" Some vaccines do contain a version of the virus that has been weakened, but it will not give you the disease it's vaccinating against. The CDC clearly describes how vaccination works here . The CDC explains: “Vaccines help develop immunity by imitating an infection. This type of infection, however, almost never causes illness, but it does cause the immune system to produce T-lymphocytes and antibodies. Sometimes, after getting a vaccine, the imitation infection can cause minor symptoms, such as fever. Such minor symptoms are normal and should be expected as the body builds immunity.” There are multiple types of vaccines. Some – not all – vaccines use parts of a virus to strengthen the immune system to it, and this is done in a medical, scientific process (see here). Safe vaccines pass many stages before becoming available to the public, see more on this here ."", 
""False: The coronavirus is not designed, Bill Gates did not patent COVID-19 and there is still no vaccine. Some vaccines work by injecting small doses of parts of a virus in a medically safe way."

He promised the companies swift regulatory approval."", ""Though there were only four known cases in South Korea at that point, “we were very nervous. We believed that it could develop into a pandemic,” one attendee, Lee Sang-won, an infectious diseases expert at the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told Reuters."", 
""“We acted like an army,” he said."", ""A week after the Jan. 27 meeting, South Korea’s CDC approved one company’s diagnostic test. Another company soon followed. By the end of February, South Korea was making headlines around the world for its drive-through screening centers and ability to test thousands of people daily."", ""South Korea’s swift action stands in stark contrast to what has transpired in the United States. Seven weeks after the train station meeting, the Koreans have tested well over 290,000 people and identified over 8,000 infections. New cases are falling off: Ninety-three were reported Wednesday, down from a daily peak of 909 two weeks earlier."", 
""The United States, whose first case was detected the same day as South Korea’s, is not even close to meeting demand for testing. About 60,000 tests have been run by public and private labs in a country of 330 million, federal officials said Tuesday."", ""As a result, U.S. officials don’t fully grasp how many Americans have been infected and where they are concentrated - crucial to containment efforts. While more than 7,000 U.S. cases had been identified as of Wednesday, as many as 96 million people could be infected in coming months, and 480,000 could die, according to a projection prepared for the American Hospital Association by Dr. James Lawler, an infectious disease expert at the University of Nebraska Medical Center."", 
""“You cannot fight what you cannot see,” said Roger Klein, a former laboratory medical director at the Cleveland Clinic and previously an adviser to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on clinical laboratory issues."", ""How the United States fell so far behind South Korea, according to infectious disease experts, clinicians and state and local officials, is a tale of many contrasts in the two nations’ public health systems: a streamlined bureaucracy versus a congested one, bold versus cautious leadership, and a sense of urgency versus a reliance on protocol."", 
""The delayed and chaotic testing in the United States will cost lives, potentially including those of doctors and nurses, many medical experts predict. Already more than 100 people have died overall, and fears of rampant spread have led to extraordinary restrictions on social interaction, upending the U.S. economy, schools, hospitals and everyday life."", ""“It makes me feel like I’m living in a farce,” said Dr. Ritu Thamman, a cardiologist and clinical assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. Even hospital staff who may have been exposed can’t get a test, she said. “We are a rich country but we don’t have these kinds of things?”"", 
""The administration of President Donald Trump was tripped up by government rules and conventions, former officials and public health experts say. Instead of drafting the private sector early on to develop tests, as South Korea did, U.S. health officials relied, as is customary, on test kits prepared by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, some of which proved faulty. Then, sticking to its time-consuming vetting procedures, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration didn’t approve tests other than the CDC’s until Feb. 29, more than five weeks after discussions with outside labs had begun."", 
""Meanwhile, in the absence of enough kits, the CDC insisted for weeks on narrow criteria for testing, recommending it only when a person had recently been to China or other hot spots or had contact with someone known to be infected. As a result, the federal government failed to screen an untold number of Americans and missed opportunities to contain the spread, clinicians and public health experts say."", ""South Korea took a risk, releasing briskly vetted tests, then circling back later to spot check their effectiveness. By contrast, the United States’ FDA said it wanted to ensure, upfront, that the tests were accurate before they went out to millions of Americans."", 
""“There are always opportunities to learn from situations like this one,” FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn, who has been on the job only three months, told Reuters. “But one thing I will stand firm on: We cannot compromise on the quality of the tests because what would be worse than no tests at all is wildly inaccurate test results.”"", ""In a statement, CDC spokesman Benjamin Haynes said, “This process has not gone as smoothly as we would have liked.” But he said “more and more state labs have come online, increasing our public health system’s ability to detect and respond to cases.”"", 
""Bombarded by criticism amid a re-election campaign, Trump vowed on Friday to ramp up production of test kits in partnership with private companies and to make the diagnostic tests more widely available at hospitals and in-store parking lots. This week, the FDA said more than 35 universities, hospitals and lab companies had begun running their own tests, under the agency’s revised policy."", ""But it may be weeks before enough tests are on hand to fill the need."", ""“The idea of anybody getting (tested) easily the way people in other countries are doing it, we’re not set up for that,” Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases told a House committee last week. “That is a failing. Let’s admit it.”"", 
""It’s a problem many Americans, accustomed to hearing they have the most advanced medical care in the world, find hard to fathom."", ""“I don’t know how we messed this up so badly,” said Ruth Blodgett, 65, whose husband of the same age couldn’t get a coronavirus test on Saturday in an urgent care clinic outside Rochester, New York, even though he was coughing and the doctor ordered one for him. ”We got caught flat-footed. For America, that’s unacceptable.”"", ""‘HURRY UP AND DEVELOP THE KITS’"", ""At the pivotal Jan. 27 meeting at the Seoul train station, South Korean government leaders told companies they were cleared for takeoff."", 
""“They were told that the ‘emergency use authorization’ would be coming, so hurry up and develop the kits,” said Lee Hyukmin, head of the coronavirus task force at the Korean Society for Laboratory Medicine, who was at the meeting."", ""One of the companies was Kogene Biotech Co Ltd, whose test kit was the only one to work initially. The government announced its approval on Feb. 4."", ""“The government acted quickly,” said Myoah Baek, an executive director at Kogene. The Korean CDC “disclosed information on test methods so test kit makers were able to speed up development.”"", 
""Lee Hyukmin of the Korean laboratory society said the government was swift - but not reckless."", ""“Of course, a kit that’s approved in one week isn’t as good as one that goes through a year of clinical trials,” he said. So in the early days, Lee said, the government cross-checked cases to ensure the tests were working properly."", ""Cross-checking involved verifying that labs got the same result the government did on an initial pool of patient samples. As of last week, nearly 100 labs were available to perform tests nationwide, according to government figures."", 
""South Korea’s rapid response to the new coronavirus resulted from scars of the past."", ""In the aftermath of the 2015 outbreak of MERS, short for the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, critics slammed then-President Park Geun-hye and her administration for a slow response and a lack of transparency. Public confidence waned in Park, who was impeached in 2017 following an unrelated corruption scandal."", ""The country had 186 MERS cases, more than anywhere outside the Middle East, including 38 deaths."", 
""“We can’t ever forget the incident. It is engraved in our mind,” the Korean CDC’s Lee Sang-won said. “We were hurt so much, and we felt remorseful.”"", ""‘A REAL FOUL UP’"", ""On Jan. 31, only days after the Seoul train station meeting, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) declared the novel coronavirus a public health emergency, citing a similar pronouncement from the World Health Organization."", ""HHS oversees the separate operations of the FDA and CDC, key agencies involved in responding to the pandemic. The CDC was responsible for developing the initial test kits for the virus. Then, under longstanding protocols, the FDA needed to approve the test before it could be sent to state and local labs around the country. Private labs and large hospitals could develop their own tests or work off the CDC version."", 
""On Feb. 3, amid the preparations to address the emergency, the FDA hosted an all-day conference at its headquarters in Silver Spring, Maryland, which had been scheduled well before the outbreak. Regulators, researchers and industry representatives gathered to discuss the general process for putting diagnostic tests cleared under emergencies on the path to permanent approval by the FDA."", ""Though coronavirus was now the hottest topic in global medicine, a broadcast of the meeting conveyed little sense of urgency about the epidemic sweeping the globe. It was mentioned in passing but regulators mostly stuck to their Powerpoint presentations."", 
""In his remarks, Dr. Timothy Stenzel, who oversees the FDA’s review of diagnostic tests, spoke broadly about the agency’s mission to protect public health: “It’s our goal to be first in the world wherever possible to authorize new tests.”"", ""Carolyn Hiller, a program director at the Medical Device Innovation Consortium, which hosted the event alongside FDA, said there were discussions with the agency about postponing the meeting because of the coronavirus outbreak, but both sides opted to go ahead."", 
""“The whole coronavirus thing blew up in real time while this was happening,” she said."", ""Stenzel did not respond to a request for comment. In a statement, the FDA acknowledged that the coronavirus was not a “specific topic on the agenda.” But it said the agency already was talking to test developers and “the conference was timely and addressed issues important” to firms and institutions looking to produce a test."", ""The following day, Feb. 4, the FDA greenlighted a CDC test kit for the virus."", 
""Weeks of chaos would follow."", ""By Feb. 8, some states and other public labs were complaining that the CDC’s test wasn’t working because of a flawed component that gave inconclusive results. Three days later, the CDC told the labs that it was manufacturing a new component."", ""As of mid-February, the federal government remained stuck in first gear. The CDC was the primary supplier of tests across much of the country, and other labs couldn’t immediately deploy their own without the FDA’s blessing."", 
""HHS said it has assigned a team of outside scientists to examine what went wrong with the CDC’s initial batch of tests, such as whether there was a manufacturing defect, flawed design or contamination in the agency’s lab. The precise problem has not been identified."", ""The CDC didn’t send out new test kits until late February. Meanwhile, public health experts say, a crucial window was closing on containing the virus, which by then was known to have infected more than 60 people."", ""The U.S. emergency declaration issued in late January created additional hurdles that hindered a wider expansion in testing, according to former federal officials and lab professionals."", 
""The declaration eased the way for drugmakers to pursue vaccines and antiviral treatments for COVID-19. But public health experts said that the same declaration made it harder to expand diagnostic testing outside the CDC."", ""That’s because the declaration required diagnostic tests developed by individual labs, such as those at hospitals or universities, to undergo greater scrutiny than in non-emergencies - presumably because the stakes are higher."", ""“Paradoxically, it increased regulations on diagnostics while it created an easier pathway for vaccines and antivirals,” said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security. “There was a real foul-up with diagnostic tests that has exposed a flaw in the United States’ pandemic response plan.”"", 
""Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, said the CDC and FDA stuck to their conventional playbook for too long."", ""“Traditional public health thinking is,‘Don’t create widespread panic and don’t go over the top. Keep the testing narrow in a precision rifle approach rather than a mass, shotgun approach,’” Schaffner said. “That failed in this instance. This virus acted differently and it overwhelmed the U.S. system. South Korea had a much better sense of what was happening.”"", 
""In a statement Tuesday, the CDC said: “After finding out that some labs could not fully verify the test, CDC began working on a solution and identifying the source of the problem …. CDC, in conjunction with FDA, determined how to move forward and shared this information immediately with public health labs.”"", ""The CDC statement also suggested that the agency was not exclusively responsible for testing delays."", ""The CDC was “not an impediment” to getting large-scale commercial testing started, according to the statement. That was the role of the FDA, and as the initial U.S. cases were being detected in late January and early February, CDC director Dr. Robert Redfield highlighted the need for that agency to act, according to the CDC statement."", 
""Alberto Gutierrez, who led the FDA’s office overseeing diagnostic testing from 2009 to 2017, said the agency proceeded with caution because it saw itself as the last line of defense against opportunistic companies looking to cash in on threats to public health. “There is money to be made in an emergency, and a lot of people try to take advantage of that,” Gutierrez said. “The problem the FDA faces is, do you let it become the Wild West?”"", ""“The FDA had good intentions,” he said."", ""As U.S. efforts faltered, South Korean officials cleared a test from a second company, Seegene Inc, on Feb. 12."", 
""With many more tests in hand, health officials were well armed to attack a fast-moving virus and aggressively track down people who may have been exposed. This testing-backed offensive helped South Korea reduce the number of new cases over a matter of weeks, serving as a model for other countries grappling with the pandemic."", ""In mid-February, cases spiked at a secretive church in the southeastern city of Daegu. On Feb. 26, Daegu city officials said they would test every single member of the church, including those without symptoms."", 
""As of March 10, Daegu said that it had tested almost all of the 10,000 members of the church in that area, and about 40% came back positive. The city, which now accounts for about three-quarters of total infections in South Korea, has seen new cases sharply drop. On Wednesday, officials announced 46 new cases compared to a peak of 741 cases on Feb. 29."", ""The country went from two approved test makers on Feb. 18 to five as of last week, according to the Korean CDC."", ""“To my surprise, test kit makers were able to boost production quickly,” Korean CDC’s Lee Sang-won said."", 
""By Feb. 24, state and local labs in the United States were pleading with the FDA to relax its rules so the nation no longer had to rely so heavily on the CDC for testing. They asked Hahn, the FDA commissioner, for “enforcement discretion” so they could use their own lab-developed tests."", ""“We are now many weeks into the response with still no diagnostic or surveillance test available outside of CDC for the vast majority of our member laboratories,” Scott Becker, chief executive of the Association of Public Health Laboratories, and Grace Kubin, lab services director at the Texas Department of State Health Services, wrote to Hahn on Feb. 24 in a letter reviewed by Reuters."", 
""In an interview, Becker, whose group represents more than 100 state and local health laboratories, called the letter a “Hail Mary” pass, an act of desperation."", ""“The entire lab community was really coming unglued. We knew we could develop tests and were very capable of doing that, but we felt hamstrung” Becker told Reuters."", ""He said labs wanted FDA to make more tests available so they could run more patient samples at a faster pace."", ""Two days after receiving Becker’s letter, the FDA commissioner said his agency was ready to approve new outside tests quickly - if its requirements for accuracy were satisfied."", 
""“False diagnostic test results can lead to significant adverse public health consequences,” Hahn wrote to the Association of Public Health Laboratories in a Feb. 26 letter, “not only serious implications for individual patient care but also serious implications for the analyses of disease progression and for public health decision-making.”"", ""Under increasing pressure, the FDA relented and removed many of the bureaucratic obstacles. On Feb. 29, the agency said public and private labs, including academic medical centers, could start using their own tests before the FDA had completed its full review. Laboratories had 15 business days to submit a completed application, which could be approved retroactively."", 
""That same day, the Trump administration confirmed the first death in the United States from the coronavirus, a man in his 50s in Washington state."", ""On March 2, Stenzel at the FDA’s diagnostic testing office hosted a webinar for lab test developers, highlighting additional challenges, including a shortage of viral samples needed for validation of test results. Some labs also have reported shortages of other key supplies and ingredients, as well as the need for more trained personnel."", ""As U.S. regulators rewrote their policies, South Korean municipalities were opening roadside testing facilities across the country, collecting samples in minutes while people sat in their cars."", 
""At a closed-door meeting last week in Congress, U.S. Representative Raul Ruiz, a Democrat from California and an emergency-room physician who treated patients during the 2009 H1N1 influenza outbreak, pressed the FDA commissioner and other members of the Trump administration on why South Korea was lapping the United States in its response."", ""“Why don’t we have drive-through testing like South Korea?” Ruiz asked leaders of the president’s coronavirus task force."", ""Ruiz told Reuters the officials said they were working on it. On their own, some hospitals and communities have begun offering drive-through testing in Colorado, New York, Texas and elsewhere."", 
""In recent days, as the public criticism grew louder, Trump appointed a testing czar to improve coordination across agencies.

To fight the coronavirus outbreak, governments across the globe have closed schools, travel and businesses big and small. Many observers have fretted about the economic costs of throwing millions of people out of work and millions of students out of school."", ""Now, three weeks after the United States and other countries took sweeping suppression steps that could last months or more, some public health specialists are exploring a different consequence of the mass shutdown: the thousands of deaths likely to arise unrelated to the disease itself."", 
""The longer the suppression lasts, history shows, the worse such outcomes will be. A surge of unemployment in 1982 cut the life spans of Americans by a collective two to three million years, researchers found. During the last recession, from 2007-2009, the bleak job market helped spike suicide rates in the United States and Europe, claiming the lives of 10,000 more people than prior to the downturn. This time, such effects could be even deeper in the weeks, months and years ahead if, as many business and political leaders are warning, the economy crashes and unemployment skyrockets to historic levels."", 
""Already, there are reports that isolation measures are triggering more domestic violence in some areas. Prolonged school closings are preventing special needs children from receiving treatment and could presage a rise in dropouts and delinquency. Public health centers will lose funding, causing a decline in their services and the health of their communities. A surge in unemployment to 20% – a forecast now common in Western economies – could cause an additional 20,000 suicides in Europe and the United States among those out of work or entering a near-empty job market."", 
""None of this is to downplay the chilling death toll COVID-19 threatens, or to suggest governments shouldn’t aggressively respond to the crisis."", ""A recent report by researchers from Imperial College London helped set the global lockdown in motion, contending that coronavirus could kill 2 million Americans and 500,000 people in Great Britain unless governments rapidly deployed severe social distancing measures. To truly work, the report said, the suppression effort would need to last, perhaps in an on-again, off-again fashion, for up to 18 months."", 
""In the United States, the White House this week said the final toll could rise to 240,000 dead. States have responded to the dire warnings, and the escalating number of cases revealed each day, by extending stay-at-home shutdowns."", ""The medical battle against COVID-19 is developing so rapidly that no one knows how it will play out or what the final casualty count will be. But researchers say history shows that responses to a deep and long economic shock, coupled with social distancing, will trigger health impacts of their own, over the short, mid and long term."", 
""Here is a look at some."", ""Domestic Violence"", ""Trapped at home with their abusers, some domestic violence victims are already experiencing more frequent and extreme violence, said Katie Ray-Jones, the chief executive officer of the National Domestic Violence Hotline."", ""Domestic violence programs across the country have cited increases in calls for help, news accounts reported – from Cincinnati to Nashville, Portland, Salt Lake City and statewide in Virginia and Arizona. The YWCA of Northern New Jersey, in another example, told Reuters its domestic violence calls have risen up to 24%."", 
""“There are special populations that are going to have impacts that go way beyond COVID-19,” said Ray-Jones, citing domestic violence victims as one."", ""Vulnerable Students"", ""Students, parents and teachers all face challenges adjusting to remote learning, as schools nationwide have been closed and online learning has begun."", ""Some experts are concerned that students at home, especially those living in unstable environments or poverty, will miss more assignments. High school students who miss at least three days a month are seven times more likely to drop out before graduating and, as a result, live nine years less than their peers, according to a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation report."", 
""Among the most vulnerable: the more than 6 million special education students across the United States. Without rigorous schooling and therapy, these students face a lifetime of challenges."", ""Special needs students “benefit the most from highly structured and customized special education,” said Sharon Vaughn, executive director of the The Meadows Center for Preventing Educational Risk at the University of Texas. “This means that they are the group that are most likely to be significantly impacted by not attending school both in the short and long term.”"", 
""In New Jersey, Matawan’s Megan Gutierrez has been overwhelmed with teaching and therapy duties for her two nonverbal autistic sons, eight and 10. She’s worried the boys, who normally work with a team of therapists and teachers, will regress. “For me, keeping those communications skills is huge, because if they don’t, that can lead to behavioral issues where they get frustrated because they can’t communicate,” Gutierrez said."", ""Soaring Suicides"", ""In Europe and the United States, suicide rates rise about 1% for every one percentage point increase in unemployment, according to research published by lead author Aaron Reeves from Oxford University. During the last recession, when the unemployment in the United States peaked at 10%, the suicide rate jumped, resulting in 4,750 more deaths. If the unemployment rate increases to 20%, the toll could well rise."", 
""“Sadly, I think there is a good chance we could see twice as many suicides over the next 24 months than we saw during the early part of the last recession,” Reeves told Reuters. That would be about 20,000 additional dead by suicide in the United States and Europe."", ""Less than three weeks after extreme suppression measures began in the United States, unemployment claims rose by nearly 10 million. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin warned the rate could reach 20% and Federal Reserve economists predicted as high as 32%. Europe faces similarly dire forecasts."", 
""Some researchers caution that suicide rates might not spike so high. The conventional wisdom is that more people will kill themselves amid skyrocketing unemployment, but communities could rally around a national effort to defeat COVID-19 and the rates may not rise, said Anne Case, who researches health economics at Princeton University. “Suicide is hard to predict even in the absence of a crisis of Biblical proportions,” Case said."", ""This week, the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colorado, relaxed its strict social isolation policies after the apparent suicides of two cadet seniors in late March, The Gazette, a Colorado Springs newspaper, reported. While juniors, sophomores and freshmen had been sent home, the college seniors were kept isolated in dorms, and some had complained of a prison-like setting. Now, the seniors will be able to leave campus for drive-thru food and congregate in small groups per state guidelines."", 
""Public Health Crippled"", ""Local health departments run programs that treat chronic diseases such as diabetes. They also help prevent childhood lead poisoning and stem the spread of the flu, tuberculosis and rabies. A severe loss of property and sales tax revenue following a wave of business failures will likely cripple these health departments, said Adriane Casalotti, chief of government affairs with the National Association of County and City Health Officials, a nonprofit focused on public health."", 
""After the 2008 recession, local health departments in the U.S. lost 23,000 positions as more than half experienced budget cuts. While it’s become popular to warn against placing economic concerns over health, Casalotti said that, on the front lines of public health, the two are inexorably linked. “What are you going to do when you have no tax base to pull from?” she asked."", ""Carol Moehrle, director of a public health department that serves five counties in northern Idaho, said her office lost about 40 of its 90 employees amid the last recession. The department had to cut a family planning program that provided birth control to women below the poverty line and a program that tested for and treated sexually transmitted diseases. She worries a depression will cause more harm."", 
""“I honestly don’t think we could be much leaner and still be viable, which is a scary thing to think about,” Moehrle said."", ""Job-loss Mortality"", ""Rises in unemployment during large recessions can set in motion a domino effect of reduced income, additional stress and unhealthy lifestyles. Those setbacks in income and health often mean people die earlier, said Till von Wachter, a University of California Los Angeles professor who researches the impact of job loss. Von Wachter said his research of past surges in unemployment suggests displaced workers could lose, on average, a year and a half of lifespan. If the jobless rate rises to 20%, this could translate into 48 million years of lost human life."", 
""Von Wachter cites measures he believes could mitigate the effects of unemployment. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act approved by the White House last week includes emergency loans to businesses and a short-time compensation program that could encourage employers to keep employees on the payroll."", ""Young People Suffer"", ""Young adults entering the job market during the coronavirus suppression may pay an especially high price over the long term."", ""First-time job hunters seeking work during periods of high unemployment live shorter and unhealthier lives, research shows. An extended freeze of the economy could shorten the lifespan of 6.4 million Americans entering the job market by an average of about two years, said Hannes Schwandt, a health economics researcher at Northwestern University, who conducted the study with von Wachter. This would be 12.8 million years of life lost."", 
""Thousands of college graduates will enter a job market at a time global business is frozen. Jason Gustave, a senior at William Paterson University in New Jersey who will be the first in his family to graduate from college, had a job in physical therapy lined up. Now his licensure exam is postponed and the earliest he could start work is September."", ""“It all depends on where the economy goes,” he said. “Is there a position still available?”"", ""In the weeks ahead, a clearer picture of the disease’s devastation will come into focus, and governments and health specialists will base their fatality estimates on a stronger factual grounding."", 
""As they do, some public health experts say, the government should weigh the costs of the suppression measures taken and consider recalibrating, if necessary."", ""Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, who researches health policy at Stanford University, said he worries governments worldwide have not yet fully considered the long term health impacts of the impending economic calamity. The coronavirus can kill, he said, but a global depression will, as well. Bhattacharya is among those urging government leaders to carefully consider the complete shutdown of businesses and schools."", 
""“Depressions are deadly for people, poor people especially,” he said."

""The antibodies are not a vaccine but could potentially be given to at-risk people with the aim of preventing them from contracting COVID-19."", ""Normally it takes around two years for a drug even to get close to approval for use on patients, but the COVID-19 pandemic means things are moving faster, he said, with steps that would previously be taken sequentially now being done in parallel."", ""Zhang, who posted the findings online, hopes the antibodies can be tested on humans in six months. If they are found to be effective in trials, actual use for treatment would take longer."", 
""Other experts urge caution."", ""“There’s a number of steps which will now need to be followed before it could be used as a treatment for coronavirus patients,” Hong Kong University infectious disease specialist Ben Cowling said when the finding was described to him by Reuters."", ""“But it’s really exciting to find these potential treatments, and then have a chance to test them out. Because if we can find more candidates, then eventually we’ll have better treatment,” Cowling said."

It said it was acting “out of an abundance of caution” after a local healthcare worker had tested positive for the disease."", ""The message was lost on many students."", ""Before leaving campus and returning to their homes and families throughout the United States and abroad, more than 100 Vanderbilt students attended parties, ignoring the school’s explicit instructions not to do so. They crowded into apartment complexes and other locations, and posed for group pictures they posted on Instagram. Many celebrated St. Patrick’s Day six days early - on the same day New York City announced it was cancelling its traditional annual parade."", 
""One photo of a March 11 party, posted on Instagram and seen by Reuters, shows a student in a makeshift hazmat suit, a black mask and green bowler hat with shamrocks, as a large group of students party in the background. “I dare you to give me corona,” reads the picture’s caption. The photo’s location jokingly claims to be “Wuhan, China” -- the origin of the global pandemic."", ""Some Vanderbilt students later learned they were infected with the virus, known as COVID-19. A private online group of students who say they have contracted coronavirus had 107 members this week, with most stating they had mild or moderate symptoms, according to posts seen by Reuters. Vanderbilt University Medical Center, an independent hospital near the campus, also reported 86 employees have tested positive for coronavirus to date, according to a spokeswoman."", 
""The example of Vanderbilt - a prestigious, private research institution in America’s South - shows that risky behavior by some young people extended far beyond the spring break mob scenes on Florida beaches that emerged last month. It illustrates the role students at some colleges - particularly those with a global footprint - have played in the pandemic."", ""Other colleges have also reported coronavirus outbreaks. Forty-four students at the University of Texas at Austin tested positive for the disease after returning from spring break in Mexico, according to a state university spokeswoman. In March, the University of Tampa said five students traveling together during spring break had tested positive."", 
""In a statement, Vanderbilt said: “Just as for our peers around the country, COVID-19 has created unprecedented challenges for our community as we have sought, above all, to protect the health and safety of our students, faculty and staff. Vanderbilt has regularly communicated with our community about the essential steps the university is taking, and that they must take, to limit the spread of disease.”"", ""The university declined to answer questions about how many students have contracted coronavirus, citing federal student privacy law."", 
""Vanderbilt began its spring break earlier than many schools. It took place between Feb. 29 and March 8, a time in which the pandemic, which began in China, was beginning to seriously affect Europe, but hadn’t yet significantly hit the United States."", ""“Vandy” is an elite school with a large cohort of well-to-do students. Many travel abroad during spring break, especially Europe. They often visit other Vanderbilt students attending study-abroad programs."", ""On Feb. 25, Vanderbilt warned students not to travel to China or South Korea - two coronavirus hot spots - and to reconsider making non-essential trips to other countries with serious outbreaks. International students were advised not to leave the United States at all."", 
""One country that hadn’t yet reported many cases was Spain. Max Schulman, a Vanderbilt junior, said he traveled to Barcelona with more than a dozen classmates and estimated that about 50 Vanderbilt students in all were there during spring break. Spain has since emerged as one of the epicenters of the global outbreak."", ""Schulman said he felt tired, restless and “delirious” on his flight back. Instead of returning to campus, he went to his family’s home in Long Island, New York, and later tested positive for coronavirus."", 
""Other Vanderbilt students who traveled to Spain and other European countries returned to the Nashville campus."", ""On March 8, an online petition started by Chinese first-year student Yihan Li asked Vanderbilt to cancel classes to protect students’ health, as the number of infections in the Nashville area slowly rose. “There have been two confirmed cases in Nashville and our students are returning from all over the world after the spring break,” the petition stated. “It is at great risk to hold classes as normal.” More than 2,000 people signed. Vanderbilt has about 12,000 full-time undergraduate and graduate students, according to its website."", 
""The same day, the university informed students that there were no confirmed cases on campus. It also noted that an unidentified student who had studied abroad but hadn’t returned to Nashville had tested positive. The announcement followed a story in the campus newspaper, the Vanderbilt Hustler, that a student in a program in Italy had later tested positive in Chicago."", ""Classes resumed on Monday, March 9. By the end of the day, the school disclosed that several students on campus reported they had been exposed to an unidentified individual who tested positive that day. It announced it was cancelling classes for the rest of the week and would soon move them online through March. The announcement added: “To be clear, the university will remain open.”"", 
""At the time, scores of other American colleges and universities were taking steps to cancel classes and switch to online instruction, according to data compiled by Bryan Alexander, a senior scholar at Georgetown University."", ""A picture of Vanderbilt’s announcement appeared on a satirical Instagram account with this comment: “Let spring break pt. 2 begin.” That night, some students began partying to both commiserate and celebrate over the end of classes, one student told Reuters."", ""On March 10, Vanderbilt issued a warning to campus residents: “There should be no parties/gatherings; students are encouraged to maintain social distance and minimize interactions with others.” The college was two days ahead of Nashville’s mayor in urging social distancing."", 
""Some seniors worried their college days were coming to an abrupt end and the campus would soon clear out, students said. Their fears soon came true: On March 11, Vanderbilt told students that a healthcare worker at Vanderbilt University Medical Center had tested positive and classes would go on line for the rest of the semester. Undergraduates living on campus should leave within four days."", ""Planned St. Patrick’s Day parties were moved up. The event is an annual tradition for many Vanderbilt students, who refer to it as “St Fratty’s” because many parties are held at fraternity houses."", 
""“We’re all here and we’re ready to fire one last time before our college careers are ended” by coronavirus, stated one Facebook post announcing an off-campus St Patrick’s Day party. Several students who attended the party later tested positive for coronavirus, according to a student. Reuters could not independently confirm this."", ""Another “St Fratty’s” celebration kicked off in the rooftop courtyard of Wesley Place apartments, a residential complex that is home to third-year and fourth-year students. Instagram pictures depict clusters of students clad in green, chatting in close proximity, drinking from beer cans and red cups, and posing together for pictures."", 
""In one photo, a group of seven young women dressed in green huddle together, hugging and holding hands. A photo collage posted by Vanderbilt’s chapter of the Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority showed small groups of young, green-clad women smiling, hugging and posing for pictures. The sorority didn’t respond to a request for comment."", ""Following the Wesley Place party, students dispersed to other locations, including off-campus fraternity houses and another apartment complex, according to students and social media posts."", 
""One video shows several dozen students in a backyard dancing, hugging and drinking. Text overlaying the video reads, “Schools out forever,” while the caption reads, “the luck of the Irish did not grace Vanderbilt this st frattys.”"", ""That same day, March 11, three news developments smashed America’s complacency about the disease. President Donald Trump imposed a 30-day ban on foreigners traveling from Europe, the National Basketball Association suspended its season, and movie star Tom Hanks announced he and his wife had tested positive for coronavirus in Australia."", 
""Some Vanderbilt students soon were reporting in private chat groups that they had contracted coronavirus."", ""A private group called “Covid Family” that consists of students who said they had contracted the virus grew to 107 members. In one poll of 80 students, a dozen answered “yes” to whether they had coronavirus, according to a screenshot. Reuters couldn’t determine if the self-reported diagnoses were accurate."", ""One infected student interviewed by Reuters attended off-campus parties and experienced symptoms on March 15 after returning home. The student’s mother also developed mild symptoms. The student said the exact source of the infection was impossible to know."", 
""Sophia Yan, a first-year Vanderbilt student from China, told Reuters she found out she had contracted coronavirus upon returning home to the Chinese city of Shenzhen on March 17. She said she didn’t attend any parties on campus, leading her to suspect the virus was more widespread at Vanderbilt than students and the administration realize."", ""She said she believes the university should have required students to report all their travels during spring break and released information about any who had tested positive, such as their whereabouts and what classes they attended."", 
""“Unfortunately, Vanderbilt’s lack of effective measures largely reflects how the United States as a whole is dealing with this crisis,” she said. “To combat this pandemic, U.S. federal and state governments, as well as the American people, must recognize the severity and urgency of the matter.”"", ""Vanderbilt didn’t respond to a specific question about Yan’s comments."", ""But it said because of federal student privacy law, “we are unable to disclose widely within the Vanderbilt community personally identifiable information about any student who has tested positive for COVID-19.”"", 
""Netra Rastogi, a Vanderbilt sophomore, doesn’t fault the administration. “I don’t think they realized that so many students at Vanderbilt wouldn’t take this whole situation seriously.”"

But what exactly do they mean?"", ""Here are some key terms explained:"", ""* There are several human coronaviruses - just as there are many other types of human viruses. The coronavirus that first emerged in people in December in China is a newly-identified human coronavirus and has been named SARS-CoV2. It is this specific coronavirus that is causing the current disease pandemic, and it should be referred to either as the new coronavirus or by its name SARS-CoV2."", 
""* COVID-19 is the name of the respiratory disease caused by SARS-CoV2, the new coronavirus. It is not caused by any other type of virus and it is not caused by just any “coronavirus”."", ""* Self-isolation applies to people who have symptoms of COVID-19 infection and to those who live with them. It involves staying at home and not going out, apart from into your own garden or yard if you have one. It also means staying away, as much as possible, from other people in the home, sleeping alone, using separate towels, and washing and cleaning regularly."", 
""* Social distancing has been introduced by many governments around the world and is designed to help people avoid catching and spreading the disease caused by the new coronavirus. It essentially means avoiding face-to-face contacts as much as possible. You can leave your home for exercise, for essential shopping or for work, but you should stay at least 2 meters from others."", ""* Both these terms are descriptive. They describe an outbreak of disease but are not classifications or rankings, and the World Health Organization (WHO) does not declare outbreaks as having pandemic or epidemic status."", 
""* Epidemic is often used to describe a large outbreak of disease over a wide geographic area and affects a high proportion of a population."", ""* Pandemic is used to described an epidemic or outbreak of disease that has spread to multiple countries on several continents and affects an exceptionally large number of people."", ""* Quarantine is a way of separating and restricting people who have been exposed to a disease, such as COVID-19, to see if they too have become infected and get ill. This is why groups of people returning to their home countries after being in Wuhan, China, for example, or after being on a cruise ship where cases of COVID-19 were detected, were quarantined for around two weeks."", 
""* The terms lockdown or shutdown are being used by many to describe more general and widespread restrictions on movement, work and travel on all people in a city, region or country."", ""* A vaccine is something that would be given to a healthy person to prevent them from being infected with a disease such as the COVID-19 disease caused by the new coronavirus."", ""* An anti-viral is a type of medicine, or therapeutic, that would be given to try and treat a person who is infected with a viral disease - such as COVID-19. Anti-virals cannot treat diseases caused by bacteria, and antibiotics cannot treat diseases caused by viruses."""

In Italy, a 2018 analysis found smoking was more common among men than women across all adult age groups."", ""* Women’s “aggressive” immune response"", ""Another factor is the relative strength of the male and female immune responses."", ""Research shows that immune response throughout life - to everything from vaccines and infections to autoimmune diseases - is typically more aggressive in women than in men. With COVID-19, a respiratory disease caused by a coronavirus, this may be a particularly significant factor."",

That means this protein is expressed at twice the dose on many immune cells in women compared to men, which in turn could well be boosting females’ ability to ward off COVID-19."""

The nonprofit, which has long helped those struggling to pay rent or keep the lights on, rallied donors and helped set up an $11 million fund that would offer up to $4,000 a month to eligible households."", ""The online application process went live on the morning of March 23. Within hours, the site crashed as more than 1,000 attempted to apply."", 
""Ultimately, the organization stopped accepting applications after about 4,500 households had sought help. By April 13, more than 9,000 additional households had placed themselves on an interest list, hoping to be able to make their case for assistance if Sacred Heart raises more money."", ""“It is the most unimaginable scenario for everyone here,” said Executive Director Poncho Guevara. The aid effort has raised an additional $5 million in recent weeks, and Guevara said it will need much more to meet demand."", 
""Charitable organizations are a critical part of the social safety net in the United States, providing food, shelter and cash assistance to vulnerable people who fall through gaps in government safety nets. But just as COVID-19 is causing a surge in demand for their services, it is straining the social service nonprofits’ efforts to help. With revenue streams dried up, fundraising events canceled and no relief in sight, some nonprofits are being forced to retrench when they are most needed."", ""Just weeks into the pandemic, some organizations have enacted widespread layoffs while others have cut programs."", 
""Reuters worked with Charity Navigator, a group that rates the performance of thousands of charities, to survey the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on nonprofits. More than 75% of the 150 responding nonprofits that provide key social services such as shelter and food reported that their organizations had suffered financially from the pandemic and the economic shutdown."", ""Meanwhile, 66% have seen an increase in demand for their services. And more than half have cut programs."", ""Nearly half of the social service nonprofits surveyed said they can’t get enough volunteers. And all of the 16 food banks responding to the survey reported a disruption in the supply chain, which is key to getting meals to vulnerable populations."", 
""While some organizations acknowledge they are unable to meet the growing need, many say they have found ways to step up despite funding shortfalls. If the crisis continues for an extended time, though, many organizations told Reuters they don’t know how they’ll be able to maintain services without additional funding."", ""“Right now, we’re spending money that’s earmarked for other purposes instead of turning people away,” said Thomas Pietrogallo, chief executive officer of The Poverello Center. The South Florida nonprofit, which in a normal week before the pandemic was feeding about 1,500 people with chronic illnesses, had to shut down its thrift stores, which typically bring in $100,000 a month."", 
""Meanwhile, the organization provided 60% more groceries in the last two weeks of March."", ""That same scenario is playing out at nonprofits of all sizes all across the country."", ""“A TERRIBLE PERFECT STORM”"", ""Feeding America, a large, national hunger-relief organization, surveyed its network of about 200 food banks and found that as of April 2, 37% had experienced an immediate funding shortfall. The crisis also made it difficult for some U.S. food banks to stock enough food to meet demand, said Katie Fitzgerald, executive vice president and chief operating officer for Feeding America. The organization’s network relies on donated food and other products, but there is little coming in now, forcing food banks to buy food to fill the gaps."", 
""“It is a really terrible perfect storm for us in that human need -- the need for food -- is skyrocketing right now at the same time the supply that we rely on for food is decreasing precipitously,” she said."", ""In Indianapolis, the line of cars waiting to pick up food at Gleaners Food Bank has grown at times to roughly 2 miles long, requiring metro police officers to direct traffic. The organization’s food pantry typically feeds 5,000 households in a month, but is on pace to provide meals to about 18,000 households in April, said Joe Slater, its chief operating officer and chief financial officer."", 
""The food pantry raised about $5 million to meet increased need through the end of May. Ensuing months may be more challenging. The organization projects it will need at least another $5 million to get through the summer, Slater said."", ""The struggle is similar for groups that provide emergency housing for victims of domestic violence."", ""On an average day, the YWCA of El Paso, Texas, offers transitional housing for more than 50 women and children fleeing abuse. But in recent weeks, because it had to enact social distancing to keep residents and staff safe, the El Paso YWCA says it has limited capacity to about 30. The charity isn’t accepting new seekers of shelter and has had to turn away four families, at a time when the El Paso police report a 9% increase in domestic violence calls."", 
""For people who live with abusers, quarantine conditions can create explosive stress levels, especially if drugs or alcohol are in the mix, said Sylvia Acosta, CEO of the El Paso YWCA."", ""“I’m worried about stay-home orders, financial stress and liquor sales all at the same time and there not being any open space right now,” Acosta said."", ""Across the United States, 11 YWCA locations told their national organization on March 30 that they may need to shut down domestic violence programs or facilities in coming weeks for lack of funding and staff."", 
""The El Paso YWCA said it is determined to keep providing services, but it lost revenue when stay-at-home orders forced it to close some of its child-care programs. Donations are up, but overall, revenue has dropped by 80%. The organization furloughed more than half of its 400 employees in late March."", ""“WE CAN’T JUST CLOSE”"", ""“Nonprofits are just like everybody right now -- in an unprecedented place -- but the difference is that we can’t just close. We can’t. This is when we’re needed the most and so we’re going to have to figure it out,” Acosta said."", 
""The pandemic’s hit to American nonprofits has global repercussions. After Tropical Cyclone Harold slammed into Vanuatu this month, thousands were left without food, shelter, or clean drinking water in the nation of South Pacific islands. World Hope International, a U.S.-based disaster relief organization, said it normally would have sent a team of up to 15 volunteers to provide drinking water for at least 10,000 people."", ""But pandemic-related travel restrictions made it impossible for World Hope to provide that support. The organization, which says it anticipates a 15% to 20% decline in revenue due to the pandemic, responded to 10 disasters around the world in 2018 and five in 2019. Continuing travel restrictions and revenue decline will hinder its ability to offer future disaster relief, the group said."", 
""Even organizations that have been able to continue their regular services are concerned about funding. More than 30% of social service organizations projected they would see at least a 20% decrease in revenue through June, and 76% reported having to cancel fundraising events, according to the survey by Reuters and Charity Navigator."", ""The $2 trillion economic package that President Trump signed into law on March 27 offers aid to some nonprofits, including access to loans to cover payroll and operating costs. The law also expands the ability of taxpayers to claim deductions on cash donations made in 2020."", 
""More help may be coming. Rep. Seth Moulton, Democrat of Massachusetts, introduced legislation on March 27 after hearing that YMCAs in his state were struggling to stay afloat while providing child care to essential workers and food to poor children out of school. The bill, which has bipartisan support, would provide $60 billion in emergency funding to nonprofits."", ""“When our team looked into it, we realized that nonprofits severely hurt by the coronavirus were not receiving the same financial relief as for-profit businesses and industries, even though they were facing the same loss of revenue and economic disruption,” Moulton said."""

A “smart city” database of thousands of people infected by the new coronavirus and their contacts. Electronic bracelets that track people breaking quarantine laws."", ""South Korea, among the first countries to bring a major coronavirus outbreak under control, is now taking steps to control the disease well into the future, relying heavily on technology and its hyper-connected society."", ""The aim is to reinvigorate Asia’s fourth-largest economy and keep it humming by building on the country’s success identifying and tracking cases without imposing major mandatory lockdowns or requiring businesses to keep employees working from home, officials say."", 
""“Without resorting to lockdowns or bans on movements, we have been able to keep our factories running to a large degree, and this is instilling the idea to the world that we are a safe and transparent production base,” President Moon Jae-in said last week."", ""South Korea’s evolving playbook is being closely watched in Europe and the United States, where governments are hoping to quickly bounce back from the crisis."", ""“We are in a lengthy tug of war with the coronavirus,” Health Minister Park Neung-hoo said last week. The battle could last months or even years, he said."", 
""South Korea’s virus-containment strategy will build on an intensive contact tracing and testing campaign that experts say has been instrumental in uncovering webs of infections that might otherwise have gone undetected."", ""Besides the testing kits and tracing techniques that have already been rolled out, South Korea plans to build out a “smart city” database and get quarantine violators to agree to use tracking bracelets. The database was designed to share information between cities on things like traffic and pollution. Health authorities plan to leverage that network to reduce the time it takes to find and isolate coronavirus cases."", 
""The database will be operated by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), giving epidemiological investigators real-time data feeds on patients, including their whereabouts, times spent at specific locations, CCTV footage, and credit card transactions."", ""That could cut the time needed to trace a patient’s movements from about one day to around ten 10 minutes, according to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, or MOLIT, which originally set up the “smart city” initiative."", 
""Along with information uploaded by the KCDC, the system compiles data from the National Police Agency, the Credit Finance Association of Korea, three telecommunications companies and 22 credit card companies."", ""Lee Soo-young, a director of the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology’s Institute for Artificial Intelligence, said the technology would help investigators track cases more efficiently, even if it raised privacy issues."", ""However, MOLIT said that investigators will need to obtain police approval to see information, and access to the database will be restricted to a small number of authorised users, ensuring the confidentiality of unrelated personal information. MOLIT also said the database information would be deleted when the outbreak was contained."", 
""A coalition of 17 human rights groups has expressed privacy concerns about the adoption of the tracking wristbands for people who violate quarantines, citing potential discrimination against patients. In response, the authorities have said that the wristbands would only be used if patients consent."", ""Another key to the South Korean virus containment strategy is stepping up border controls. Around half of new cases in recent weeks have been found in people arriving from overseas, according to the KCDC."", 
""Rather than outright bans, South Korea is using widespread testing and technology-enabled tracking to allow people to travel to the country. Mandatory testing and quarantines now apply to nearly all arrivals from overseas, including citizens."", ""South Korea installed walk-through facilities this month at Seoul’s Incheon International Airport to test anyone who arrives with symptoms. Those who don’t show symptoms will also be tested within three days."", ""All arrivals must download a government app that tracks their location and requires users to report any symptoms. Then everyone, regardless of nationality or whether they tested negative, must self-isolate for two weeks."", 
""After the two-week period, the app shows a message saying users are free to delete it from their phones."", ""Health officials say they are also looking to adapt the social distancing policies they called for early in the crisis - urging people to avoid large gatherings or leave their homes, but imposing no actual “stay home” orders - in coming weeks."", ""The government plans to develop more practices in homes, offices, and public places to reduce the risk of another large outbreak, while allowing economic and social life to resume."", 
""Some of the long-term policies being discussed include making workplaces less crowded, and persuading Koreans that it is not a virtue to show up at work when sick, Yoon Tae-ho, director general for public health policy at the health ministry told Reuters."", ""In a glimpse of what could become long-term practices, the KCDC last week outlined preventive measures for schools, churches and some entertainment facilities that included disinfection schedules, guidelines on how close people can be to each other and temperature checks."", 
""“Our goal is to be able to control infections in a way that our health and medical system, including personnel and sickbeds, can handle them at usual levels,” Park, the health minister, said."", ""South Korean officials say that means keeping new cases under 50 per day, a level first reached last week. On Tuesday, South Korea reported 27 new cases."", ""The country is also stepping up efforts to improve testing and boost resources for hospitals."", ""Hospitals are testing all pneumonia patients, and staff at places like nursing homes and medical facilities will be regularly tested. Authorities have designated two new hospitals and are building a third to specialize in treating infectious diseases."", 
""The government, in a supplementary budget, has allocated an extra 135 billion won ($111 million) to build 120 additional isolation rooms, buy more medical equipment and specialised ambulances, cover the costs of medical staff handling coronavirus cases, and prepare for future epidemics."", ""New regulations also designate supplies like face masks, safety goggles, disinfectants, protective clothing, and infrared cameras to detect fevers as strategic items that will be stockpiled by the government, the Ministry of Interior and Safety said."", 
""“We will have to step up our daily hygiene and disease prevention standards,” Yoon said. “It will be a tedious battle, but we have to do this.”"

By manually plugging the software into a suspect’s phone, police can break in and determine where the person has gone and whom he or she has met."", ""Now, as governments fight the spread of COVID-19, Cellebrite is pitching the same capability to help authorities learn who a coronavirus sufferer may have infected. When someone tests positive, authorities can siphon up the patient’s location data and contacts, making it easy to “quarantine the right people,” according to a Cellebrite email pitch to the Delhi police force this month."", 
""This would usually be done with consent, the email said. But in legally justified cases, such as when a patient violates a law against public gatherings, police could use the tools to break into a confiscated device, Cellebrite advised. “We do not need the phone passcode to collect the data,” the salesman wrote to a senior officer in an April 22 email reviewed by Reuters."", ""A Cellebrite spokeswoman said the salesman was offering the same tools the company has long sold to help police enforce the law. The company is also offering a version of its product line for use by healthcare workers to trace the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19, but the tools can only be used with patient consent and can’t hack phones, she said."", 
""Cellebrite’s marketing overtures are part of a wave of efforts by at least eight surveillance and cyber-intelligence companies attempting to sell repurposed spy and law enforcement tools to track the virus and enforce quarantines, according to interviews with executives and non-public company promotional materials reviewed by Reuters."", ""For a graphic on Tracing COVID-19, click tmsnrt.rs/3f00GRK"", ""The executives declined to specify which countries have purchased their surveillance products, citing confidentiality agreements with governments. But executives at four of the companies said they are piloting or in the process of installing products to counter coronavirus in more than a dozen countries in Latin America, Europe and Asia. A Delhi police spokesman said the force wasn’t using Cellebrite for coronavirus containment. Reuters is not aware of any purchases by the U.S. government."", 
""So far, Israel is the only country known to be testing a mass surveillance system pitched by the companies, asking NSO Group, one of the industry’s biggest players, to help build its platform. But the rollout of NSO’s surveillance project with the Israeli Ministry of Defense is on hold pending legal challenges related to privacy issues, an NSO executive said. A spokesman for Israeli Defense Minister Naftali Bennett said NSO was involved in the project but did not provide further details."", ""Surveillance-tech companies have flourished in recent years as law enforcement and spy agencies around the world have sought new methods for countering adversaries who now often communicate through encrypted mobile apps. The firms argue that their experience helping governments track shadowy networks of militants makes them uniquely qualified to uncover the silent spread of a novel disease."", 
""“I really believe this industry is doing more good than bad,” said Tal Dilian, a former Israeli intelligence officer and now a co-chief executive officer of Cyprus-based Intellexa, a cyber-surveillance firm that works with intelligence agencies in Southeast Asia and Europe. “Now is a good time to show that to the world.”"", ""Yet some technologists remain skeptical that spying tools reliant on phone location data can be used to effectively combat a virus."", ""“It’s not precise enough, that’s the point. It’s not nearly going to get you down to whether you’re next to a certain person or not,” said Michael Veale, a lecturer in digital rights and regulation at University College London."", 
""While the methods for location tracking and accuracy vary, surveillance companies say they can narrow down a person’s coordinates to within three feet, depending on conditions."", ""Privacy issues loom. Civil liberties advocates fear that virus tracking efforts could open the door to the kind of ubiquitous government surveillance efforts they have fought for decades. Some are alarmed by the potential role of spyware firms, arguing their involvement could undermine the public trust governments need to restrain the spread of the virus."", 
""“This public health crisis needs a public health solution - not the interjection of for-profit surveillance companies looking to exploit this crisis,” said Edin Omanovic, advocacy director for the UK-based civil liberties group Privacy International."", ""Claudio Guarnieri, a technologist with the human rights organization Amnesty International, said any new surveillance powers embraced by states to combat the virus should be met with “high scrutiny.”"", ""“New systems of control, from location tracking to contact tracing, all raise different concerns on necessity and proportionality,” said Guarnieri."", 
""Cellebrite, for one, said it requires “agencies that use our solutions to uphold the standards of international human rights law.”"", ""Government officials have sought to address such concerns by pointing to the unprecedented nature of the crisis. COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus, has so far infected more than 3 million people worldwide, killing over 210,000."", ""In South Africa, for example, after the government last month announced it would use telecom data to track the movements of citizens infected with COVID-19, a communications minister acknowledged concerns about loss of privacy."", 
""“We do respect that everyone has a right to privacy, but in a situation like this our individual rights do not supersede the country’s rights,” Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams, the communications minister, said at a press conference for South Africa’s COVID-19 command council this month."", ""The South African Health Ministry declined to comment on details of the program and whether it had contracted with any of the intelligence firms."", ""A number of countries are developing and deploying COVID-19 contact-tracing apps that do not rely on location data. Instead, these apps, already in use in Singapore, India and Colombia, tap the smartphone connectivity technology Bluetooth to sense and record when other devices are nearby. When someone tests positive for coronavirus, typically, everyone that person made contact with is notified."", 
""Christophe Fraser, an epidemiologist at Oxford University’s Big Data Institute, said this approach, if implemented properly, could save lives and shorten lockdowns. “The idea is to try and maximize social distancing practices of those at risk of infection and minimize the impact on all the other people,” he said."", ""This app-based approach to contact tracing is considered, by its advocates, as more privacy friendly because people voluntarily download the app and sensitive personal data are visible only to health authorities. This method of containing the disease is the focus of a rare collaboration between Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google to quickly deploy the Bluetooth-based technology for use in the United States and elsewhere. But the approach relies on widespread adoption of the apps, and its accuracy remains unproven."", 
""Apple says its plan is designed to “help amplify the efforts of the public health authorities” and that “many factors will help flatten [infection] curves — no one believes this is the only one.” A Google spokesman referred to a prior statement, which said “each user will have to make an explicit choice to turn on the technology.”"", ""By contrast, deploying a mass surveillance platform like Intellexa’s means everyone would be under collection right away; no one needs to opt in, nor could anyone opt out. Such a setup can be done remotely in a matter of weeks, said an executive at NSO Group, which is also offering its wares to fight the coronavirus."", 
""The surging spyware business is estimated by research firm MarketsandMarkets to be worth $3.6 billion this year."", ""But the industry has been dogged by legal and ethical concerns. Human rights groups have accused some companies of helping undemocratic governments target dissidents and activists. The companies say they help governments prevent terrorism and capture criminals."", ""Last year, for example, Facebook’s WhatsApp unit accused NSO Group of helping governments hack 1,400 targets that included activists, journalists, diplomats and state officials. NSO denies the allegations, saying it only provides the technology to government agencies under strict controls and is not involved in operations."", 
""Intellexa’s Dilian fled Cyprus last year after an arrest warrant was issued for him, on accusations that he used a surveillance van to illegally intercept communications in the country. Dilian denies the allegations, returned to Cyprus last month and said he is cooperating with authorities. A Cypriot police spokesman told Reuters the investigation is active."", ""Now, industry executives, investors and analysts say the coronavirus crisis offers intelligence firms the possibility of billions of dollars in business, while burnishing their reputations."", 
""India is among the courted countries. In April, New York-based Verint Systems asked Indian officials to pay $5 million for a year’s subscription to a host of services designed to track and surveil people with coronavirus. Those included a cellphone tower geolocation platform and a program to monitor social media activity, according to documents seen by Reuters and a person with knowledge of the negotiations. No sale has yet been agreed in India, the source said."", ""A Verint spokesman declined to answer questions, instead referring to an April 16 press release which said unspecified products were being used by an unnamed country to help respond to COVID-19. India’s Ministry of Interior said it had not purchased a system from Verint."", 
""NSO Group and Intellexa are also both pitching COVID-19 tracking platforms to countries across Asia, Latin America and Europe. Their technology could allow a government to track the movement of nearly every person in the country who carries a cellphone, sucking up a continuous trove of location data. Installed within telecom providers, the technology functions through the analysis of call records, said NSO and Intellexa executives."", ""When a person tests positive, the systems would allow authorities to input the result, tracking those who made contact with the patient in the past few weeks. Those exposed would receive a text message encouraging them to get tested or self-isolate. NSO said the system’s administrators would not see the identity of individuals."", 
""Revelations in 2013 that the U.S. National Security Agency had collected this kind of mobile phone data about Americans to track national security threats created a storm of controversy and fueled new restrictions on surveillance."", ""Suzanne Spaulding, a former U.S. intelligence community lawyer and senior Homeland Security official, described this potential COVID-19 tracking approach as “among the most privacy-invasive.” That’s because it “envisions all of the data about everyone’s movements, not just infected individuals and their known contacts, going to the government.”"", 
""South Korea, Pakistan, Ecuador and South Africa have all indicated in public statements they were rolling out contact tracing systems using telecom data to track infected citizens, though the details haven’t been released."", ""South Korean officials say any loss of privacy from surveillance must be weighed against the disastrous economic consequences caused from a long-term shutdown."", ""“It is also a restriction of freedom when you ban free movement of people in crisis,” Jung Seung-soo, a deputy director at the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, told Reuters. The country is not using outside surveillance vendors, the official said."", 
""Intellexa is in the process of installing its system in two Western European countries, Dilian said. He declined to name them."", ""In an interview with Reuters, NSO employees responsible for the product said the company is piloting the approach in 10 countries in Asia, the Middle East and Latin America, but declined to name them."", ""Three other Israeli companies, Rayzone Group, Cobwebs Technologies and Patternz, are offering countries coronavirus tracking capabilities. These largely rely on location data gathered from mobile advertising platforms, according to company promotional documents reviewed by Reuters and people familiar with the companies."", 
""Rayzone Group declined to comment. Requests for comment to Patternz went unanswered. Omri Timianker, president and co-founder of Cobwebs Technologies, said his company is working with five governments to help track the spread of the virus, but declined to identify them."", ""While some experts say advertising data isn’t precise enough to combat the spread of COVID-19, the documents reviewed by Reuters suggest the three firms are marketing technology which they contend can ingest and process advertising data into a form that’s useful for narrowly tracking individuals."", 
""Intellexa’s Dilian said his company’s platform will cost between $9 million and $16 million for countries with large populations. He believes COVID-19 tracking will be just the beginning. Once the pandemic ends, he hopes countries that invested in his mass surveillance tool will adapt it for espionage and security. “We want to enable them to upgrade,” he said."

""Vietnam, a country of 96 million people which shares a border with China, is signalling that it has succeeded where many wealthier and more developed countries have not by containing the new coronavirus."", ""The government is officially reporting a relatively small 270 cases and zero deaths.

He added that the CDC has “great confidence” in the Vietnamese government’s response to the crisis."", 
""Vietnam increased the number of laboratories that can test for COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, from three at the beginning of the outbreak in January, to 112 by April."", ""As of Wednesday, 213,743 tests had been conducted in Vietnam, of which 270 were positive, according to health ministry data."", ""That ratio of 791 tests to every confirmed case is by far the highest in the world, according to data from health ministries compiled by Reuters.

""Vietnam has been helped, experts said, by the combination of its authoritarian leadership and its open market economy, and a population with a memory of previous epidemics ready to cooperate."", ""“It is organised, it can make country-wide policy decisions that get enacted quickly and efficiently and without too much controversy,” said Guy Thwaites, director of the Oxford University Clinical Research Unit in Ho Chi Minh City. Thwaites’s laboratory has been helping to process tests."", ""Thwaites said the number of positive tests processed by his organisation’s lab was in line with government data. He said the hospital where he works on the wards – Ho Chi Minh City’s 550-bed Hospital for Tropical Diseases, serving a population of 45 million people in southern Vietnam – had not admitted any additional cases not reflected in the government’s numbers."", 
""“If there was ongoing and unreported or unappreciated community transmission, we would have seen the patients in our hospital. We have not,” he said. Thwaites said his organisation’s lab increased capacity from being able to do around 100 tests a day to around 1,000 a day."", ""Managers of 13 funeral homes in Hanoi contacted by Reuters said they had seen no uptick in deaths. One said requests for funerals had gone down during the country’s lockdown, now lifted, because of the reduction in traffic accidents, one of the biggest killers in Vietnam."", 
""Todd Pollack, a Hanoi-based infectious diseases specialist at Harvard Medical School, said that less than 10% of the people who tested positive for the virus in Vietnam were over 60 – the age group most likely to die from COVID-19. All patients, he added, were closely monitored in health facilities and given good medical care. Pollack said a good comparison to Vietnam was South Korea, another country which managed to roll out a large testing programme and keep deaths relatively low."", ""“The case fatality rate in South Korea is around 2%, in part because they are testing so widely,” said Pollack. “If we apply that rate to Vietnam’s number of confirmed cases, and consider these other factors, we can understand how they have avoided any deaths so far.”"", 
""Krutika Kuppalli, an infectious disease physician and biosecurity fellow at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said: “There is no way to possibly know for certain, but they have done a great job with their response, with the testing and isolating and quarantining people.”"", ""In late February, as U.S. President Donald Trump was still downplaying the dangers of the new coronavirus, Viet and his colleagues began sourcing crucial components needed to mass produce COVID-19 testing kits from the United States and Germany."", 
""Researchers at Vietnam’s state-run Military Medical University, working with Viet A Corp, had already designed a test kit, and the government handed a license to the private company to mass produce the kit. Viet said his company’s kits – which can perform multiple tests – had now provided 250,000 tests in Vietnam and had exported kits with capacity for 20,000 tests."", ""As early as Jan. 23, Vietnam suspended flights to and from the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the outbreak started, immediately after discovering its first two cases. It acted even though the WHO was at that point advising against travel restrictions. A week after that, Vietnam effectively closed its 1,400-km (870-mile) border with China to all but essential trade."", 
""By mid-March, Vietnam made the wearing of masks in public places mandatory nationwide, well ahead of most other countries and not heeding the WHO’s advice that only people with symptoms should wear them. Some of Vietnam’s garment factories turned to making surgical and cloth masks to meet demand."", ""The WHO said that in April it had published advice on non-medical mask wearing in situations where social distancing cannot be avoided, but said medical masks must be prioritised for health care workers."", 
""Vietnam’s testing ramp-up took place in tandem with a thorough contact-tracing programme and the quarantine of tens of thousands of people, many of them overseas Vietnamese returning home to escape worsening outbreaks in Europe and the United States."", ""Viet A Corp’s tests were first put into use on March 4, Viet told Reuters. In the six weeks prior to that, the country had gradually increased testing, but the number of people with the virus remained below 20. In the second week of March, that number more than doubled."",

""A spokesman for the Houthi movement, Mohammad Abdulsalam, referred Reuters to the Houthi health ministry. The health ministry did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. On May 3, a Houthi official told a press conference in Sanaa that authorities had detected suspected cases and tested them but did not provide a figure or mention the results."", ""Asked by Reuters whether it was concerned about a coronavirus outbreak going unreported in Houthi-held areas, the WHO said its role was to “actively advise, influence and inform” discussions on case declaration and reporting, which it said it had been doing for weeks."",

""As of May 9, Yemen had reported 803 COVID-19 test results, according to WHO data. At that time, the WHO said Yemen had 38 COVID-19 isolation units - 18 of them operational, four labs with testing capacity, 520 intensive care unit (ICU) beds and 154 ICU ventilators."", ""The WHO said in a report on Monday that a surge in cases could overwhelm Yemen’s healthcare facilities."", ""Yemen has long been plagued by wars and humanitarian disasters.

""The Western-backed coalition failed to crush the rebellion by the Houthi movement and its allies, and the war has been in stalemate for years with the Houthis holding most large urban centres."", ""The conflict, which has killed more than 100,000 since 2015, has already caused what the U.N. says is the world’s worst humanitarian crisis with some 24 million Yemenis, or 80% of the population, reliant on aid and some 10 million facing hunger."", ""Health and sanitation systems are wrecked and diseases such as cholera are rife.

Emerald churns out plastic bags for produce, like baby carrots and iceberg lettuce, and Kelly attributed the growth, in part, to the perception that packaged produce is a safer alternative to unwrapped items."", 
""Emerald represents the other side of the current novel coronavirus crisis, which has seen unemployment surge to levels not seen since the Great Depression. The jobless rate hit 14.7% in April. While many companies face a slump, some are rushing to add workers, including delivery services like Instacart. A recent survey by the Atlanta Fed concluded there have been three jobs added to the U.S. economy for every 10 layoffs."", ""Eric Schnur, CEO of specialty chemical maker Lubrizol Corp., owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Corp, said he anticipates “many millions in extra costs associated with responding to COVID-19.” Lubrizol’s business boom includes a three-fold increase in its output of the gelling agent used to make hand sanitizer."", 
""Schnur said the extra costs go beyond stepped up cleaning and safety equipment and includes “significant increases in supply chain and logistics costs as we work to get our materials to those who have the greatest need.”"", ""Another company facing added costs is Calumet Electronics Corp., in Calumet, Mich., which said it has spent $80,000 on everything from soap to mobile desks to keep workers safe through the crisis."", ""For Emerald, orders surged 150% in March and were up another 7% in April. But there’s a dark side to that surge, both in terms of cost and complexity."", 
""All the steps the company has taken — both to boost output and keep workers safe — are expected to add at least $350,000 to costs by the end of the year. This doesn’t include the lost production time, which adds up to at least an hour each day, that machines have to be shut down for cleaning. Kelly, Emerald’s chief executive officer, said he hasn’t figured out what this will do to his profits, but he expects a big hit to his margins. Emerald is a family-owned business with annual sales of about $85 million."", 
""One of the biggest costs for Emerald was $50,000 Kelly spent on an automated temperature scanner. When the crisis first hit, Emerald implemented a regimen that included workers getting their temperature taken at the start and end of each shift."", ""But Kelly soon realized there was a problem having 40 people at the start of each shift waiting to be checked, one by one, by someone standing close to each employee as they were screened."", ""“It also just isn’t comfortable,” he said. “You know it’s a temperature gun, but you basically are holding a gun up to someone else’s head. It just made everyone uncomfortable.”"", 
""The new system will be a scanner that flashes a red warning signal if someone walks by with a body temperature over 100.4 degrees."", ""Another big-ticket item is the cleaning, which accounts for $75,000 of the added costs. This includes assigning six workers — two on each shift — to constantly scrub and sanitize surfaces and $10,000 for six backpacks that these workers now use to hose floors with cleanser. The company, which was founded in 1963 by Kelly’s father, has added 10 workers to its staff of 240 and is heaping on overtime as well to get the orders out the door."", 
""Even the company’s rag bill exploded. They used to buy 2,000 rags a week. Now it’s 7,000. The cost of that one item has jumped from $300 a month to $1,000, while disposable glove use has tripled."", ""Michael Rincon, Emerald’s director of operations, says each week brings new twists. For instance, they’ve discovered that having workers constantly wiping surfaces with isopropyl alcohol erodes signs and buttons — but they only realized that after it was too late. On one machine in the factory, the word “danger” printed in bright red has blurred."", 
""Rincon said the faded labels will be repainted. But he’s also had to replace buttons on machines that have had the lettering rubbed away. The cost of a new button isn’t much, but the repairs mean costly shutdowns on lines that run around the clock. Some buttons can be replaced in a few minutes, but others take longer, said Rincon."", ""Kelly said he even thought about trying to put through a price increase to offset some of these expenses. But a few weeks ago, his biggest customer let him know that was a non-starter. The customer told Kelly he was going to see who else might be able to supply him with produce bags, presumably at a better price."", 
""Besides the costs, there are also plenty of unpredictable management challenges. The company made masks mandatory eight weeks ago, at the very beginning of the crisis, but Kelly and other managers still find workers in the plant who aren’t wearing them or are wearing them incorrectly."", ""One problem is the nature of their factory, which is dominated by large, noisy machines. The only way to communicate in many parts of the factory is to lean your head right next to your coworker. “I’m constantly walking through the factory — throwing my arms apart — to remind people,” said Kelly."", 
""Emerald has had three false alarms, with workers either calling in sick or falling sick at work and being sent home. However, none tested positive for COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus."", ""Kelly said that in a country that regulates so many things, there’s still no good government guidance beyond general guidelines."", ""“The toughest thing is that there isn’t much direction from the state or the federal government,” Pallavi Joyappa, Emerald’s chief operating officer, said. “You are kind of making it up as you go along.”"""

""Across the United Kingdom, thousands of people have died in care homes after becoming infected with the coronavirus, according to the government’s own statistics. Advocacy groups that run helplines for families of care home residents say callers are desperate for more information about where outbreaks have occurred. But they say they aren’t getting it."", ""“This lack of transparency is a problem for all sorts of reasons,” said Ruthe Isden, health and care influencing director at Age UK, an advocate for the elderly. “It’s very hard to get a handle on what’s going on in care homes.”"", 
""Helen Wildbore, director of the Relatives & Residents Association, a national charity supporting families of people in residential care, told Reuters that ensuring open communication between care homes and families “will help to allay any fears and ensure there isn’t an information gap which causes unnecessary anxiety.”"", ""A Reuters investigation last week detailed how the government’s focus on shielding hospitals, to prevent emergency wards from being overwhelmed, left care home residents and staff exposed to COVID-19. To free up hospital beds, patients were discharged into homes for the elderly and vulnerable, often without being tested for the coronavirus that causes the disease."", 
""When Reuters asked for details of deaths in three homes badly hit by the virus in the London borough of Enfield, officials at the Care Quality Commission (CQC), which regulates care homes in England, said they could not disclose the data from any individual establishment."", ""“This has nothing to do with protecting the reputation of the providers concerned, but is about protecting the privacy and confidentiality of those who have died and their families,” CQC spokesperson Kirstin Hannaford wrote in an email to Reuters."", 
""Scotland’s regulator, the Care Inspectorate, said it too would not provide site-level data to Reuters."", ""Regulators in Wales and Northern Ireland also declined to provide similar information."", ""The UK’s opposition Labour Party endorsed the calls for publishing the data. A shadow care minister, Liz Kendall, said more disclosure from the CQC “is crucial in tackling the spread of the virus in care homes.”"", ""“Families and the wider public must know when and where outbreaks of coronavirus are happening,” she told Reuters. “This information is crucial in ensuring care homes are given the resources, support and attention they need to stop the spread of this awful virus.”"", 
""Authorities have documented nearly 10,000 deaths in care homes across the United Kingdom linked to the novel coronavirus through May 1, but the toll is likely much higher. A Reuters data analysis estimated a higher toll."", ""Drawing on official statistics, Reuters compared the total number of care home deaths in the eight weeks to May 1 with historical averages. The figures showed at least 20,000 excess deaths in care homes in England and Wales during the pandemic."", ""Pressed by opposition Labour leader Keir Starmer on Wednesday about the high number of deaths in care homes, Prime Minister Boris Johnson told parliament: “Now, I am not going to try to pretend to the House that the figures, when they are finally confirmed, are anything other than stark and deeply, deeply horrifying. This has been an appalling epidemic.”"", 
""Some care homes were hit particularly hard, Reuters found. In Enfield, a north London borough of 334,000 people, outbreaks had occurred in at least 42 out of 82 care homes by April 24. By April 30, at least 136 deaths were linked to the virus in Enfield care homes, including residents who died in hospital."", ""The Care Quality Commission, or CQC, requires care home operators to notify the agency of deaths and has asked them to describe which deaths are suspected of being linked to the coronavirus. The agency has been releasing breakdowns by area. This data doesn’t show disparities between care homes, nor where outbreaks have occurred."", 
""When Reuters pressed the agency last week to release more detailed information under the UK’s Freedom of Information Act, an official declined the request, on the grounds that care home operators have a reasonable expectation of confidentiality and wouldn’t properly notify authorities of deaths - as the law requires - if they knew the information could be made public."", ""Simon Richardson, an information rights manager at the CQC, said that telling the public how many people have died, and where, “risks creating confusion as to the prevalence, spread or impact of the virus at this time.” Releasing such information, he told Reuters in a letter explaining his decision, would “likely to impede the national effort to deal with the pandemic, and therefore to create a significant risk to public health.”"", 
""The public interest in disclosure of the information is “outweighed by the public interest in ensuring that the clear, authoritative and comprehensive statistics being produced by the Office for National Statistics aren’t confused or clouded, and in preventing the additional deaths that are likely to arise if the production of those figures is undermined,” Richardson wrote to Reuters."", ""Emma Jones, a human rights solicitor and partner at law firm Leigh Day, said the commission is adopting a “very patriarchal stance.”"", 
""“I don’t know whether the reasons they are giving for not providing the information would withstand a legal challenge.”"", ""The Department of Health and Social Care endorsed the CQC’s decision not to publish the death tolls due to concerns about patient confidentiality. A spokesperson said: “We’re aware of the concern that relatives and the public are experiencing, and we are working closely” with government agencies “to better understand the impact of this virus on care homes.”"", ""In the United States, a number of states are proactively publishing death totals at individual nursing homes, including California, New York, Illinois and Florida."""

""Authorities say they aim to test all 11 million residents, though the priority are people from 12 categories, such as school, medical, transport, supermarket and government workers and people returning from overseas or leaving Wuhan for work."", ""“Even though there weren’t any new cases in a while it seems Wuhan continues to have asymptomatic patients. Everyday there’s a few,” said Zhu Fangmin, 43, who stood in a queue of more than 60 people."", ""“It’s very likely these people could be around us so this wide-scale examination will put people’s mind at ease,” she said."", 
""One test site was made up of two tables. At the first, a volunteer took down identification details. The other was staffed by two nurses dressed in face shields, gloves and hazmat suits, one of whom took throat swabs from residents."", ""Some people expressed concern that they could catch the virus through the testing exercise, by standing in the queues. “I heard that the nurses aren’t switching their gloves,” said one woman who gave her surname as Chen."", ""Health News, a newspaper affiliated to China’s National Health Commission, said on Tuesday while the exercise would likely cost Wuhan more than 1 billion yuan, it would help find possible sources of infection and provide reassurance for work resumption purposes and to other provinces receiving travellers from Wuhan."", 
""Wuhan now had a daily testing capacity of 100,000 and 63 agencies that could process nucleic acid tests, the newspaper said. But if it wanted to hit its target of testing all residents in 10 days, it would need to test 730,000 people a day, it said."", ""Reuters, citing an internal document to district officials, reported on Monday that the city planned to conduct the campaign over 10 days. A government official said on Wednesday city districts could conduct tests at their own pace for now as the city health authority had yet to issue a notice about officially starting the tests."",

""While a shortage of testing kits was blamed for slowing China’s response to the outbreak in the early days, by March tests were relatively easy to obtain at Wuhan’s hospitals and clinics and residents were told they could get their results by a mobile app."", ""Since Wuhan’s lockdown was lifted on April 8, the city has conducted an average of 47,422 tests a day and more than 1.66 million tests in total, according to Reuters calculations based on health authority reports."", ""Wuhan tested 67,026 people on May 13, government data showed, the second highest level since it started publishing data on Feb. 21."""

They reported on Sunday in the Journal of Medical Virology that the most common laboratory test abnormality observed in adults was a low level of immune cells called lymphocytes (B cells and T cells). This condition, known as lymphopenia, developed in up to 80% of adults but in less than 10% of children. On the other hand, children - particularly infants - were more likely to have elevated levels of cardiac enzymes that indicate heart injury. They also found additional differences.

Fever occurred in up to 99% of adults but in 43% of children; cough in up to 82% of adults but 43% of children.

The drug had nearly become a standard of care for patients with COVID-19 in many hospitals, even though randomized trials have not yet confirmed its value. But people around the world use decades-old hydroxychloroquine to treat malaria as well as inflammatory conditions like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, and researchers are seeing occasional cases of coronavirus infection in these patients despite long-term use of the drug. A report on Sunday in the Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy describes two such patients, one with rheumatoid arthritis and the other with a condition called mixed connectivitis. The authors say they also know of at least three other patients in Italy who became sick with COVID-19 despite taking hydroxychloroquine for chronic arthritis. \""Patients actually taking long-term hydroxychloroquine are potentially immunosuppressed patients since they are living with chronic inflammatory diseases and thus do not represent the general population exposed to COVID-19,\"" the French doctors acknowledge. \""However, these observational data are not in favor of a universal protective effect of hydroxychloroquine.\"" (bit.ly/3cDC7bH)"",

Now researchers at the OSU James Comprehensive Cancer Center in Columbus, Ohio say they have a way to screen over 100,000 samples per day. Their system, dubbed REMBRANDT, makes copies of the virus and introduces two barcodes that simplify patient identification. Barcoding of samples for screening is not new, but the OSU method takes a unique biochemical approach, aiming for a single barcoding and virus-copying step. \""Barcodes on products in the supermarket, and molecular barcodes for REMBRANDT work the same way,\"" investigator Richard Fishel told Reuters. \""In this case, each patient has a unique combination of letters that allows for their simplified identification.

The results, released on Friday in the New England Journal of Medicine, showed benefits for people with advanced or moderate disease. Overall, 2,104 COVID-19 patients were randomly assigned to receive dexamethasone and 4,321 to receive usual care. Four weeks later, dexamethasone had reduced the risk of death by 36% among patients who needed mechanical ventilation when they entered the study, and by 18% among those who were receiving oxygen without mechanical ventilation. The drug did not improve survival among patients who were not using oxygen or mechanical ventilation. In an editorial, Dr. H. Clifford Lane and Dr. Anthony Fauci from the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said the results show the crucial importance of large, well-designed, carefully run, randomized controlled trials. Even during a pandemic, they said, when it might be tempting to simply \""give all therapies a chance,\"" in order for patients' outcomes to improve \""there will need to be fewer small or inconclusive studies and more studies such as the dexamethasone trial.\"" (bit.ly/2ODqKpC; bit.ly/2CGrZlo)"", 
""Immune cells may recognize the coronavirus years later"", ""Researchers in Singapore are not worried that antibodies to the novel coronavirus fade quickly. More important, they said, is that immune system cells called T cells and B cells \""remember\"" the virus and can trigger an immune response. As reported on Wednesday in the journal Nature, the researchers looked for \""memory\"" T cells in 36 COVID-19 survivors, 23 survivors of the 2003 coronavirus that caused SARS, and 37 people who never had either illness. All COVID-19 survivors had T cells that recognized the novel coronavirus. The SARS survivors all had T cells that remembered the 2003 virus - and their T cells also recognized the new coronavirus. Furthermore, more than half of those who were never infected with either coronavirus had protective T cells, suggesting they may have encountered other coronaviruses in the past, and there may be some pre-existing immunity to the new coronavirus in the general population. \""We find the present discussion about 'antibodies are fading away' a little pointless,\"" three of the researchers told Reuters in a joint email. \""What is important is that a level of B and T cell memory remain to be present to quickly start an effective immune response able to stop viral spread,\"" said Anthony Tanoto Tan of Duke-NUS Medical School, along with colleagues Nina Le Bert and Antonio Bertoletti.

""Low interferon levels identify high-risk COVID-19"", ""Low blood levels of a type of interferon (IFN) could identify COVID-19 patients at high risk for severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Interferons are naturally occurring proteins that help the body's immune system fight infection. In a study published on Monday in the journal Science, researchers found that severely and critically ill COVID-19 patients had severely impaired production of IFN type I, persistent virus in the blood and an excessive inflammatory response. They said the findings support the potential value of treating these patients early on with IFN, combined with anti-inflammatory drugs or steroids such as dexamethasone in the most severely ill people. They also found that low plasma levels of type-I IFN were seen before patients began to deteriorate and require intensive care. \""Levels of circulating Type 1 IFN could even characterize each stage of disease, with the lowest levels observed in the most severe patients,\"" they said in a news release.

""Heart disease may underlie mysterious blood findings in COVID-19 patients"", ""Severe COVID-19 predominantly affects the lungs, but elevated blood levels of troponin, a protein released during heart injury, also are common. To learn more, cardiologists in London performed cardiovascular magnetic resonance scans in COVID-19 survivors who had at least mildly elevated troponin levels while hospitalized. Among 29 people with no obvious reason for elevated troponin, such as a heart attack, they found two patterns of myocarditis, or heart muscle inflammation. In patients with one pattern, heart function seemed unaffected. These patients should undergo cardiology follow-up to monitor for any potential long-term consequences, Dr. Dan Knight of the Royal Free Hospital told Reuters. The other pattern, seen in roughly a third of patients, was associated with reduced blood supply to the heart, or ischemic heart disease. Many patients in this group \""had important coronary artery disease which was previously unknown but required further treatment\"" that would not have been offered had troponin levels not been investigated, Knight said. The main message, Knight added, is that when troponin levels are elevated in COVID-19 patients with no apparent reason, further workup could reveal undiagnosed heart disease. (bit.ly/3958hfc)"",

""He and other vaccine and immunology experts also said it does not necessarily follow that waning immunity in natural cases of COVID-19 infection would be the same with vaccine-induced immune response:"", ""“If we can, we’d want to improve on nature,” he said in a telephone interview. “With vaccines, of course, we’re not infecting with the virus directly, but we’re presenting the surface protein delivered by a different vector, or made in the laboratory and injected into the arm ... so the ideal goal is to do better than infection itself by making the vaccine immunity even stronger than the natural one.”"", 
""Griffin said one approach could be that when viable vaccines are developed, authorities should reckon with getting booster shots to millions of people at regular intervals, or even combining two or more types of vaccine in each person to elicit the best possible protection."", ""Practically, however, that presents a vast challenge. “Giving the entire world even one dose of a vaccine is one thing,” he said. “Giving them multiple doses is quite another.”"

""Milder coronavirus infections generate fewer antibodies"", ""Any immunity to coronavirus reinfection among people who already have had COVID-19 might wane after a few months, particularly if their infection was mild, two studies suggest. Researchers at Kings College London tracked 65 COVID-19 patients for up to 94 days. All but two developed neutralizing antibodies that defend against future virus attacks, the researchers reported on Saturday on the website medRxiv in advance of peer review. People with more severe infections had more neutralizing antibodies, but in everyone, levels of such antibodies peaked after three to four weeks and then declined. Antibodies are protective proteins generated by the immune system in response to an invading pathogen. \""If the person had a high peak antibody level, then the neutralizing antibody level was still high after two to three months,\"" study leader Katie Doores told Reuters. But in people with milder infections, who developed fewer neutralizing antibodies, those antibodies started to disappear after two to three months, similar to what is seen in patients who recover from seasonal coronaviruses that cause common colds. \""We are not trying to say that immunity is gone after three months. There are still many unknowns that need to be addressed, especially the level of antibody that would be needed for protection from infection,\"" Doores said. \""In terms of vaccine, this study suggests that a booster vaccination may be required,\"" Doores added. In a separate study published on Monday in the journal Nature Medicine, Australian researchers reported that 41 people who had experienced mild to moderate cases of COVID-19 had inconsistent and \""generally modest\"" neutralizing antibody responses.

""Fast walkers may have lower risk for severe COVID-19"", ""How quickly people generally walk may be linked to their risk of developing severe COVID-19, a new study suggested. Researchers analyzed data on more than 400,000 participants in the UK Biobank, a British registry that closely tracks people's health over many years. Overall, 973 participants developed a coronavirus infection severe enough to require hospitalization. Compared to normal-weight individuals, people with obesity had a 49% higher risk for severe COVID-19. But slow walkers had the highest risk of severe COVID-19 regardless of obesity status. For example, normal-weight people who usually walked at a slow pace - less than 3 miles per hour (4.8 km per hour) - had more than double the odds of developing severe COVID-19 compared to normal-weight people who typically walked more briskly - more than 4 miles per hour (6.4 km per hour). People with slow walking speed often have other underlying conditions that contribute to poor health. Gait speed is often used to test the physical capacity of adults and to predict risk of future disease, disability and death. \""Self-reported walking pace, a simple measure of functional fitness, appears to be a risk factor for severe COVID-19 that is independent of obesity,\"" the authors of the current study wrote in a paper posted on Saturday on medRxiv, ahead of peer review.

Doctors at Emory University in Atlanta treated 10 such patients with lung radiation and compared them to 10 patients of similar ages who received usual care, without radiation. With radiation, the average time to significant improvement was three days, compared to 12 days in the control group."", 
""Other potential effects included a shorter average time to hospital discharge (12 days with radiation versus 20 days without it) and a lower risk of mechanical ventilation (10% with radiation versus 40% without it). But those two differences were too small to rule out the possibility they were due to chance, the researchers found."", ""The radiation group was “a little older, a little sicker, and their lungs were a little more damaged ... but despite that we saw a strong signal of efficacy,” Emory’s Dr. Mohammad Khan told Reuters."", 
""Khan noted that in the radiation group, COVID-19 medications were withheld before and after the treatment, so the results reflect the effect of the radiation alone."", ""“Radiotherapy,” Khan said, “can reduce the inflammation in the lungs of COVID-19 patients and reduce the cytokines that are causing the inflammation.” Cytokines are proteins made by the immune system. The results on the first five patients have been accepted for publication by the journal Cancer."", ""The results on all 10 were posted on Tuesday ahead of peer review on the website medRxiv. The researchers have launched a randomized controlled trial of the treatment and expect to eventually include multiple centers. (bit.ly/2DDaAdI)"", 
""Smoking may boost severe COVID-19 risk among young adults"", ""Close to one third of young U.S. adults appear to have an elevated risk for severe COVID-19, with smoking their strongest risk factor, according to survey data."", ""Researchers looked at data from more than 8,000 participants, ages 18 to 25, in the nationally representative National Health Interview Survey for 2016 to 2018. They also looked at participants’ medical conditions identified by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as making people of any age “medically vulnerable” to severe illness from the coronavirus."", 
""Among these are diabetes, heart disease, immune problems, smoking, poorly controlled HIV or AIDS, and respiratory diseases. Overall, 32% of the young adults surveyed were seen as medically vulnerable to severe COVID-19. Among non-smoking young adults, however, only 16% were seen as medically vulnerable."", ""\""Efforts to reduce smoking and e-cigarette use among young adults would likely reduce their medical vulnerability to severe illness,\"" the researchers said on Monday in the study published in the Journal of Adolescent Health. \""Our analysis suggests that risk from smoking and e-cigarette use is highest among young adults who are male, white, and lower income and who are fully or partially uninsured.\"" (bit.ly/32mZ9S2)"", 
""Coronavirus may rarely pass through placenta"", ""It is unclear whether the coronavirus can pass through the womb from mother to fetus."", ""On Tuesday, doctors in France reported a very rare case that suggests transmission through the placenta may be possible. In the journal Nature Communications, they described a baby born prematurely to a mother with COVID-19. They found the virus in placental tissue as well as in the mother’s and baby’s blood, which suggests that transplacental transmission of the novel coronavirus virus may be possible, although further studies are needed. Both mother and baby recovered well."", 
""Marian Knight, a professor of maternal and child population health at Oxford University, said the case should not be a major worry for pregnant women. Among the many thousands of babies born to mothers infected with the virus, only around 1% to 2% have been reported to also have had a positive test, Knight said.

Volunteers who got two doses of the vaccine had levels of virus-killing antibodies that exceeded the average levels seen in recovered COVID-19 patients."", 
""Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, whose researchers developed Moderna’s vaccine candidate, called the results good news.

Some areas in virus hot spots in the populous South and West regions have either shut down businesses again or paused reopenings."", 
""The economy slipped into recession in February."", ""“Home building is coming back at a steady, if unspectacular pace,” said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia. “The numbers also verify that many people are leaving, or planning to leave, big cities as telecommuting becomes the norm for many businesses.”"", ""Housing starts increased 17.3% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.186 million units last month, the Commerce Department said. The percentage gain was the largest since October 2016. Data for May was revised up to a 1.011 million-unit pace from the previously reported 974,000."", 
""Still, homebuilding remains 24.3% below its February level. The South and the West accounted for about 75% of housing starts last month. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast starts increasing to a rate of 1.169 million units."", ""A survey on Thursday showed confidence among single-family homebuilders vaulting in July to levels that prevailed before the coronavirus crisis upended the economy in March."", ""Builders reported increased demand for single-family homes in lower density markets, including small metro areas, rural markets and large metro suburbs. The public health crisis has shifted office work from commercial business districts to homes, a trend that economists predict could become permanent."", 
""Demand for housing is being supported by cheaper mortgage rates. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is at an average of 2.98%, the lowest since 1971, according to data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac."", ""But with a staggering 32 million Americans collecting unemployment checks and lumber prices at a two-year high, a robust housing market is unlikely. Unemployment could worsen as new cases of the respiratory illness sky-rocket without a coordinated national effort to control the spread of the virus."", 
""In a separate report on Friday, the University of Michigan said its consumer sentiment index dropped to a reading of 73.2 in mid-July “due to the widespread resurgence of the coronavirus” from 78.1 in June. It warned further declines were likely in the months ahead."", ""The United States reported at least 77,000 new COVID-19 cases nationwide on Thursday, a record daily jump in known infections for the seventh time this month, according to a Reuters tally."", ""“Sentiment will likely remain subdued in the absence of a more substantial health response that will result in better virus containment and prevent repeated closures that will cause more permanent damage to the labor market,” said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York."", 
""Stocks on Wall Street fell as investors worried about the explosion in coronavirus cases. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies while U.S. Treasury prices rose."", ""Home building last month was boosted by a 17.2% jump in the construction of singe-family housing units, which accounts for the largest share of the housing market, to a rate of 831,000 units. Groundbreaking activity increased in the Midwest, South and Northeast, but fell in the West."", ""Starts are likely to advance further in the coming months. Permits for future homebuilding rose 2.1% to a rate of 1.241 million units in June, placing them well ahead of starts. Single-family building permits shot up 11.8% to a rate of 834,000 units."", 
""Starts for the volatile multi-family housing segment jumped 17.5% to a pace of 355,000 units. But multi-family building permits dropped 13.4% to a rate of 407,000 units."", ""“There had been a trend to multi-family construction but this could be reversed if the experience with the pandemic results in the reported urban flight becoming a longer-run phenomenon,” said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York."", ""There was also a rise last month in housing completions, though the stock of homes under construction dipped. That, together with increased groundbreaking and building permits, could help to ease an acute shortage of homes for sale that has constrained the housing market."""

So why have we seen laboratories overwhelmed and many patients again waiting a week or more for results?"", ""At the heart of the crisis is a reliance by public and private labs on automated testing equipment that locks them in to using proprietary chemical kits and other tools made by a handful of manufacturers."", ""The result: as infection rates spike nationwide, many labs aren’t running anywhere near capacity because of supply-chain bottlenecks, according to Reuters interviews with 16 hospital, state, commercial and academic labs and an analysis of state and city procurement plans."", 
""A few companies – Cepheid DHR.N, Hologic Inc HOLX.O, Roche ROG.S and Abbott Laboratories ABT.N – dominate this market. Their machines run on chemical kits and disposable plastic parts like sample plates and pipettes that only they sell, much like branded printer cartridges."", ""“The vendors are in an impossible situation right now where they can’t say yes to everyone,” said Geoffrey Baird, who runs the medical laboratory at the University of Washington."", ""U.S. labs now run about 800,000 diagnostic tests daily, according to the COVID Tracking Project. But the United States needs 6-10 million tests per day, by various estimates."", 
""Congress has earmarked $11 billion to support this drive, and in May, states filed plans with the government describing the equipment and supplies they would buy."", ""But taken together, the plans show that public health officials are not addressing the core supply-chain problem, according to the Reuters analysis."", ""Many states planned to buy more of these automated machines from just two manufacturers, even though the same equipment was already running below capacity or idled in other states because of shortages of chemicals or parts."", 
""Other countries, including China and Canada, have not been hamstrung to the same extent by supply shortages. Their use of less automated testing provided more flexibility in sourcing such materials."", ""Early in the pandemic, testing looked similar globally. Lab workers would extract genetic material using one instrument, and then move to a second machine to identify it. But such multi-step tests are labor-intensive and require technical expertise."", ""Many U.S. labs now rely on the highly automated - or “sample-to-answer” - analyzers. But some experts say this has proved inadequate because of a lack of standardized chemicals and parts."", 
""Gary Procop, who helps lead the Cleveland Clinic’s labs, said the government could have used the Defense Production Act (DPA) to scale up multi-step tests, using existing instructions from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."", ""“That uses really standardized reagents,” Procop said of the CDC test. “You could make that in a generic form, if you will, and take the companies out of it. And then you could actually mass-produce that type of a test. But nobody’s done that.”"", ""The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services told Reuters the government had used the DPA to buy some testing supplies, but reagents used to run the CDC test are already available, so buying more would not help."", 
""“As a result of working directly with companies to improve their supply chain, eliminate barriers, and investing through the DPA, we do expect supplies of each of these platforms to increase in the fall,” spokeswoman Mia Heck said in a statement."", ""Health experts also caution there is no single, simple solution to testing in a once-in-a-century pandemic that has infected more than 16 million people and killed more than 640,000 worldwide."", ""In China, combining patients’ samples to save supplies made it possible to test millions of Beijing residents in June, beating back a resurgent outbreak. But experts warn this method can increase false negative results and be ineffective when disease is prevalent."", 
""Canada has built up a domestic supply chain for chemicals in multi-step tests, meaning most patients can be diagnosed within a few days. Yet this regime is more viable in a country with a fraction of the U.S. population."", ""“When you’re asked to process more than 1,000 samples a day - or more than 4,000 as we are now doing - you have to do some of it on sample-to-answer platforms,” said Alex Greninger, assistant director of University of Washington Medicine Clinical Virology Laboratories."", ""By late April, Hologic, Cepheid, Roche and Abbott were all selling COVID-19 tests for their automated machines. Lab workers could load samples into the devices, sometimes hundreds at a time, and walk away."", 
""Those companies became critical to the U.S. response. A May survey from the Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP) showed 47% of labs listed one of them as its primary COVID-19 testing system."", ""For states seeking to boost testing capacity, the most sought-after machine has been Hologic’s Panther, which can process up to 1,000 tests in 24 hours, state filings show."", ""“The demand has been amazing. We feel very proud of the role we’re playing,” Hologic CEO Stephen MacMillan told an investor conference in June."", 
""The company “had virtually every governor in the U.S. just talk to us directly over the last few weeks, months, pleading their case for why they need more,” he said."", ""Twenty nine states and cities planned to buy a total of at least 51 Panthers, which are also used to test for HIV and other infections. Officials in Washington and North Carolina told Reuters they were still waiting on delivery."", ""However Hologic is not making enough COVID-19 kits to run on its existing machines - about 1,100 across the country - at capacity. At full tilt, the machines could process about 33 million tests per month, but the company makes roughly 4.8 million."", 
""Hologic said its manufacturing teams were working around the clock while it hires more people and invests in new equipment to increase production. The company said it had already made “a huge contribution” to testing, making it possible for labs to generate more results with less hands-on time."", ""The runner-up in states’ plans was Cepheid, with 45 of its GeneXpert machines on wish-lists. The company, which has about 25,000 machines worldwide, is making about 2 million tests per month - enough to run two or three tests globally per machine each day."", 
""Cepheid is focusing on customers that need rapid results, like hospitals, said Chief Medical Officer David Persing. It is working on millions of new cartridges but does not expect a dramatic supply boost until mid-2021."", ""‘WE WENT TO THE BUFFET’"", ""This month, Arkansas congressional leaders warned in a letter to Vice President Mike Pence that their state’s hospitals were testing at 10% of capacity. There are shortages of key supplies from Roche, Abbott, Cepheid and Hologic, said the state’s medical director of infectious diseases Naveen Patil."", 
""Roche told Reuters its automated equipment reduces errors, frees up staff and returns results more quickly. The company said it is increasing production capacity, and is “very intentional” about where it sends tests and instruments."", ""Abbott said it is expanding capacity, and closely managing supply to ensure tests get where they are needed."", ""Some labs have managed shortages by buying instruments from different vendors, so they can take advantage of whichever vendor’s supplies are available. But that also means they run below capacity, according to the Reuters interviews. The AMP survey found 57% of labs were running tests on at least three companies’ machines."", 
""“It’s pretty much like we went to the buffet and got one of everything,” said University of Washington’s Baird, whose lab runs most of the state’s tests."", ""But as cases spiked in more than 30 states this month, some labs became overwhelmed as they struggled to get chemicals and disposable parts."", ""In the months ahead, separate antigen tests and gene-sequencing machines could boost capacity. The National Institutes of Health is working with companies to reach at least 6 million tests per day by December."", 
""Some labs are also turning to suppliers of multi-step tests."", ""New Jersey’s RUCDR Infinite Biologics can run 50,000 samples a day in two steps. Arizona’s Sonora Quest recently announced a plan to run up to 60,000 tests a day using similar equipment."", ""Gary Kobinger, a Canadian researcher best known for his work on Ebola, argues that all diagnostics should be done on open platforms."", ""“At one point there will be a new pathogen, and the company that makes the cassette that is controlling everything is not going to be able to supply you,” he said."",

Trump on Thursday raised the possibility of delaying the Nov. 3 presidential election."", ""“This is hard to swallow,” said Jason Reed, finance professor at the University of Notre Dame’s Mendoza College of Business. “Right now, the American economy is speeding toward a fiscal cliff. Not only do we need Americans to take serious action preventing the spread of the disease, but we also need Congress to agree on another stimulus package and quickly.”"", 
""Gross domestic product collapsed at a 32.9% annualized rate last quarter, the deepest decline in output since the government started keeping records in 1947. The drop in GDP was more than triple the previous all-time decline of 10% in the second quarter of 1958. The economy contracted at a 5.0% pace in the first quarter. It fell into recession in February."", ""Economists polled by Reuters had forecast GDP slumping at a 34.1% rate in the April-June quarter."", ""On a year-on-year basis GDP fell a record 9.5% last quarter. Output shrank 10.6% in the first half. The level of GDP has dropped to levels last seen in the last quarter of 2014."", 
""Though activity picked up starting in May, momentum has slowed amid the explosion of COVID-19 infections, especially in the densely populated South and West regions where authorities in hard-hit areas are closing businesses again and pausing reopenings. That has tempered hopes of a sharp rebound in growth in the third quarter."", ""Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday acknowledged the slowdown in activity. The U.S. central bank kept interest rates near zero and pledged to continue pumping money into the economy."", 
""Trump’s campaign shrugged off the GDP slump, saying the economy was “rebounding.” Biden blamed a leadership “failure,” and urged “a massive public health response to save lives and get our economy back up to speed.” Stocks on Wall Street fell. The dollar dipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose."", ""Economists say without the historic fiscal package of nearly $3 trillion (2.3 trillion pounds), the economic contraction would have been deeper. The package offered companies help paying wages and gave millions of unemployed Americans a weekly $600 supplement, which expires on Friday. Many companies have exhausted their loans."", 
""This, together with the sky-rocketing coronavirus infections is keeping layoffs elevated. In a separate report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for unemployment benefits increased 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 1.434 million in the week ending July 25.

""“These $600 payments are adding about $75 billion per month to household income, at a time when income from work has plummeted. The loss of huge amounts of unemployment income in the near term would be a significant drag on consumer spending.”"", ""There have been claims, mostly from Republicans, that the generous jobless benefits are discouraging some of the unemployed from looking for work. The GDP report showed income at the disposal of households surged $1.53 trillion in the second quarter compared to an increase of $157.8 billion in the January-March period."", 
""A significant portion of the income was stashed away, boosting savings to $4.69 trillion from $1.59 trillion in the first quarter. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the U.S. economy, plunged at a 34.6% pace last quarter."", ""Business investment tumbled at a 27% rate. It was pulled down by spending on equipment, which collapsed at a 37.7% rate. Investment is equipment has now contracted for five straight quarters.

In some patients, the heart may be \""in serious trouble as a part of COVID-19 disease,\"" Dr. Valentina Puntmann of University Hospital Frankfurt told Reuters. Among 100 patients ages 45 to 53, \""a considerable majority\"" - 78 - had inflammation in the heart muscle and lining. Sixty-seven had recovered at home while 33 had required hospitalization. Half of the former patients were more than two months out since their diagnosis at the time of the MRI. Thirty-six patients reported ongoing shortness of breath and general exhaustion, and 71 had blood markers of heart muscle damage. Compared with similar people who had not had COVID-19, the recently recovered patients' hearts pumped more weakly and displayed other risk factors for heart failure. Puntmann suspects the abnormalities are signs of permanent problems. \""While we do not have direct evidence for late consequences yet, such as the development of heart failure ... it is quite possible that in a few years, this burden will be enormous based on what we have learned from other viral conditions that similarly affect the heart,\"" she said. (bit.ly/304omz1; bit.ly/3g5PDGH)"", 
""Mutation may have made virus more vulnerable to vaccines"", ""A genetic mutation that made the new coronavirus more infectious may also make it more vulnerable to vaccines, researchers believe. The mutation, designated D614G, increases the number of \""spikes\"" on the surface of the virus and makes them more stable, allowing the virus to more efficiently break into and infect cells. The mutation will not pose problems for vaccines now in clinical trials, however, because the extra spikes retain the targets for the \""neutralizing antibodies\"" the vaccines are designed to induce. Those targets, called receptor-binding domains, or RBDs, are the places where the spike attaches itself to the cells it infects. With more spikes, there are more RBDs for the antibodies to bind to in order to neutralize the virus. \""The gain in infectivity provided by D614G came at the cost of making the virus more vulnerable to neutralizing antibodies,\"" the researchers wrote in a paper posted on medRxiv on Friday ahead of peer review. (bit.ly/39vmRNr)"", 
""Do-it-yourself masks should have several layers"", ""Do-it-yourself face masks are far more effective at blocking virus-containing droplets if they are made with two or three layers of fabric, researchers advised on Friday in the journal Thorax. Using high-speed video and special lighting, they saw that when masks have multiple layers, fewer droplets generated by speaking, coughing and sneezing escape, and droplets that do escape do not spread as far. There is a tradeoff between protection and breathability as the number of layers increases, but \""three layers is quite comfortable,\"" study coauthor Raina MacIntyre of UNSW Sydney, in Australia, told Reuters. For their experiments, her team compared masks made from a single or double layer of T-shirt fabric, which had a thread count of 170/inch. They also tested a surgical mask. Freeze frames from the video showed that while the surgical mask was most effective, the two-ply cloth mask did a fairly good job at limiting the distance droplets traveled. Even the one-ply mask was helpful. \""The effectiveness of a mask depends on several factors other than filtration, which is what we tested,\"" MacIntyre added. \""For example, the outer layer should be made of a water-resistant fabric such as polyester,\"" she said. \""It is also best to use fabrics with high thread count and fine weave.\"" (bit.ly/3hzumFE)"", 
""Pandemic may increase children’s risks for eating disorder"", ""Pediatricians in Australia report a dramatic increase in severe cases of the eating disorder anorexia nervosa during the pandemic and are concerned that the same thing might be happening among vulnerable young people worldwide. People with anorexia have a pathological fear of becoming fat, and as a result they can become severely malnourished and suffer life-threatening heart damage. At Perth Children's Hospital, the number of children with anorexia nervosa requiring hospitalization for nutritional rehabilitation since the start of the pandemic has more than doubled compared with the three previous years, researchers said in a paper published on Friday in Archives of Disease in Childhood. Lockdowns may have \""disconnected patients from protective factors\"" like school routine and peer relationships, they speculate. Also, they warn, many patients have additional mental health issues like depression, anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder, which may be worsened by the increased focus on hand hygiene and fear of contracting COVID-19. \""We all urgently need to better understand the reasons why young people with eating disorders have been hospitalized at very high rates during COVID-19, to know how to best help and ensure their physical health safety,\"" study leader Dr. Yasheer Venay Haripersad told Reuters.

""Even though the first vaccines aren’t expected to go to market for months, polls show that many Americans are already concerned about taking a new COVID-19 vaccine, which is being developed at a record pace. Some 28% of Americans say they are not interested in getting the vaccine, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted between July 15-21. Among them, more than 50% said they were nervous about the speed of development. More than a third said they did not trust the people behind the vaccine’s development."", 
""The U.K.-based non-profit Center for Countering Digital Hate reported in July that anti-vaccination content is flourishing on social media sites. Facebook groups and pages accounted for more than half of the total anti-vaccine following across all the social media platforms studied by the CCDH."", ""One public Facebook group called “REFUSE CORONA V@X AND SCREW BILL GATES,” referring to the billionaire whose foundation is helping to fund the development of vaccines, was started in April by Michael Schneider, a 42-year-old city contractor in Waukesha, Wisconsin. The group grew to 14,000 members in under four months. It was one of more than a dozen created in the last few months which were dedicated to opposing the COVID-19 vaccine and the idea that it might be mandated by governments, Reuters found."", 
""Schneider told Reuters he is suspicious of the COVID-19 vaccine because he thinks it is being developed too fast to be safe. “I think a lot of people are freaking out,” he said."", ""Posts about the COVID-19 vaccine that have been labeled on Facebook as containing \""false information\"" but not removed include one by Schneider linking to a YouTube video that claimed the COVID-19 vaccine will alter people’s DNA, and a post that claimed the vaccine would give people coronavirus. (See Reuters fact-check: reut.rs/30t1toW]"", 
""Facebook said that these posts did not violate its policies related to imminent harm. “If we simply removed all conspiracy theories and hoaxes, they would exist elsewhere on the internet and broader social media ecosystem. This helps give more context when these hoaxes appear elsewhere,” a spokeswoman said."", ""Facebook does not label or remove posts or ads that express opposition to vaccines if they do not contain false claims. Hirsch said Facebook believes users should be able to express such personal views and that more aggressive censorship of anti-vaccine views could also push people hesitant about vaccines towards the anti-vaccine camp."", 
""‘IT’S KIND OF ON STEROIDS’"", ""At the crux of Facebook’s decisions over what it removes are two considerations, Hirsch said. If a post is identified as containing simply false information, it will be labeled and Facebook can reduce its reach by limiting how many people will be shown the post. For example, it took this approach with the video Schneider posted suggesting the COVID-19 vaccine could alter people’s DNA."", ""If the false information is likely to cause imminent harm, then it will be removed altogether. Last month, under these rules, the company removed a video touting hydroxychloroquine as a coronavirus cure – though only after it racked up millions of views."", 
""In March 2019, Facebook said it would start reducing the rankings and search recommendations of groups and pages spreading misinformation about any vaccines. Facebook’s algorithms also lift up links to organizations like the WHO when people search for vaccine information on the platform."", ""Some public health experts want Facebook to lower their removal standards when considering false claims about the future COVID-19 vaccines. “I think there is a duty (by) platforms like that to ensure that they are removing anything that could lead to harm,” said Rupali Limaye, a social scientist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, who has been in talks with Facebook. “Because it is such a deadly virus, I think it shouldn’t just have to be ‘imminent.’”"", 
""But Jacob Mchangama, the executive director of Copenhagen-based think tank Justitia who was consulted by Facebook about its vaccine approach, fears the fallout from mass deletions: “This may have long-term consequences for free speech when this virus is hopefully contained,” he said."", ""Misinformation about other vaccines has rarely met Facebook’s threshold for risking imminent harm."", ""However, in Pakistan last year, the company intervened to take down false claims about the polio vaccine drive that were leading to violence against health workers. In the Pacific island state of Samoa, Facebook deleted vaccine misinformation because the low vaccination rate was exacerbating a dangerous measles outbreak."", 
""“With regard to vaccines, it’s not a theoretical line … we do try to determine when there is likely going to be imminent harm resulting from misinformation and we try to act in those situations,” Hirsch told Reuters."", ""To combat misinformation that doesn’t meet its removal criteria, Facebook pays outside fact-checkers – including a Reuters unit – who can rate posts as false and attach an explanation. The company has said that 95 percent of the time, people who saw fact-checkers' warning labels did not click through to the content. [bit.ly/33z7Jh6]"", 
""Still, the fact-checking program has been criticized by some researchers as an inadequate response to the amount and speed of viral misinformation on the platforms. Fact-checkers also do not rate politicians’ posts and they do not judge posts that are exclusively in private or hidden groups."", ""Determining what constitutes a false claim regarding the COVID-19 shot is much harder than fact-checking a claim about an established vaccine with a proven safety record, Facebook fact-checkers told Reuters."", 
""“There is a lot of content that we see and we don’t even know what to do with it,” echoed Emmanuel Vincent, founder of Science Feedback, another Facebook fact-checking partner, who said the number of vaccines in development made it difficult to debunk claims about how a shot would work."", ""In a study published in May in the journal Nature, physicist Neil Johnson’s research group found that there were nearly three times as many active anti-vaccination groups on Facebook as pro-vaccination groups during a global measles outbreak from February to October 2019, and they were faster growing."", 
""Since the study was published, anti-vaccine views and COVID-19 vaccine conspiracies have flourished on the platform, Johnson said, adding, “It’s kind of on steroids.”"

""Exposure to common colds may impact COVID-19 severity"", ""In patients with COVID-19, the immune system's T cells learn to recognize and target the new coronavirus. But some people who were never infected with the virus nonetheless have T cells that also recognize it. Researchers had suspected that in these individuals, past exposure to other coronaviruses, such as those that cause the common cold, had somehow primed their T cells to recognize and attack this new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), and new research appears to confirm that. In studies of human blood samples collected well before the new coronavirus was discovered, researchers found T cells that were equally reactive against the new virus and four types of common cold coronaviruses. The strongest T cell responses to the new coronavirus were associated with the spike protein the virus uses to enter human cells. \""We knew there was pre-existing reactivity, and this study provides very strong direct molecular evidence that memory T cells can 'see' sequences that are very similar between common cold coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2,\"" coauthor Alessandro Sette of the La Jolla Institute for Immunology said in a statement.

""“This virus has already spread all over Indonesia. What we are doing is basically herd immunity,” said Prijo Sidipratomo, dean of the Faculty of Medicine at the National Veterans Development University in Jakarta. “So, we should just dig many, many graves.” Herd immunity describes a scenario where a large proportion of the population contracts the virus and then widespread immunity stops the disease from spreading."", ""Government spokesman Wiku Adisasmito did not respond to detailed questions from Reuters.

Widodo’s push to use a less reliable test diverted resources away from PCR tests, three lab managers told Reuters."", 
""Lie told Reuters that importers of the rapid tests, including large state-owned enterprises and private companies, made “huge profits” by charging consumers up to 1 million rupiah ($68), even though each test costs only 50,000 rupiah ($3.50)."", ""By mid-April, provincial governments said rapid testing in the provinces in West Java, Bali and Yogyakarta produced hundreds of false negatives and false positives."", ""But the tests continued to be widely used and it took until July for imports of rapid tests to be halted and for the government to introduce a price cap of 150,000 rupiah ($10). In July, Indonesia also formally advised provincial governments and others not to use rapid testing for diagnostic purposes in their updated guidelines for COVID-19 prevention and control."", 
""But Lie said there is a huge stockpile and rapid tests are still being broadly deployed, including for screening office workers and travellers to allow them to move freely for 14 days."", ""“That is like saying for the next 14 days after the rapid test they are free from the virus. That’s pure nonsense. All it indicates, and not very accurately, is they were free from the virus when the sample was taken,” said Lie."", ""Adisasmito declined to comment on whether the president’s call for rapid testing undermined its overall testing efforts. He did acknowledge the inaccuracies of rapid testing but said it was still useful in some situations where the capacity to use PCR tests is limited, including screening travellers. He did not directly answer questions about companies making large profits from tests."", 
""The central government does not disclose the level of national rapid testing. But data from West Java, Indonesia’s largest province with 50 million people, shows that it has conducted 50% more rapid tests than PCR tests."", ""Government officials say 269 labs with PCR machines are now operating.

That is still low compared to other Asian countries. South Korea said in May it traced and tested almost 8,000 people after a man with the virus visited a nightclub."", 
""According to five people familiar with the matter, the WHO advised Indonesian authorities that contact tracing should involve at least 20 people tracked per confirmed and suspected case.

And early reports did not find strong evidence of children as major contributors to the deadly virus that has killed more than 780,000 people globally."", 
""But more recent studies are starting to show how contagious infected children, even those with no symptoms, might be."", ""“Contrary to what we believed, based on the epidemiological data, kids are not spared from this pandemic,” said Dr. Alessio Fasano, director of the Mucosal Immunology and Biology Research Center at Massachusetts General Hospital and author of a new study."", ""Schools across the United States and elsewhere are trying out a wide range of strategies to reopen, from all online classes to all in person. They are asking whether reopening schools with stringent mitigation measures is worth the risk to students, families and educators, given that keeping schools closed will likely harm academic progress, social and emotional development, mental health and food security."", 
""“We can’t just sit back and assume that there’ll be no problems with schools… I think we have to reopen schools, but we have to reopen them cautiously,” said Dr. Matthew Snape, Associate Professor in General Paediatrics and Vaccinology at University of Oxford."", ""Dr. Fasano and colleagues at Boston’s Massachusetts General and MassGeneral Hospital for Children found that infected children have a significantly higher level of virus in their airways than adults hospitalized in intensive care units for COVID-19 treatment. The high viral levels were found in infants through young adults."", 
""The study, published on Thursday in the Journal of Pediatrics, involved 192 participants ages 0-22 who were seen at urgent care clinics for suspected COVID-19. Forty-nine of them - a quarter of the total - tested positive for the virus. Another 18 were included after being diagnosed with multisystem inflammatory syndrome, a serious COVID-related illness than can develop several weeks after an infection."", ""The research suggests that children can carry a high viral load, meaning they can be very contagious, regardless of their susceptibility to developing a COVID-19 illness."", 
""“There has been some conflicting data out there about the degree to which children can be contagious,” said Dr. Marybeth Sexton, assistant professor of infectious diseases at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta, who was not involved in the study. “This is further evidence that we may see children as sources of infection.”"", ""She added more extensive research is needed."", ""“NOBODY IS SPARED”"", ""A separate study published last month in JAMA Pediatrics found that older children hospitalized with COVID-19 had similar levels of the virus in their upper respiratory tract as adults, but children younger than five carried significantly greater amounts."", 
""However, other medical groups show differing information over children’s potential to spread the virus. The American Academy of Pediatrics on Wednesday updated its guidelines to reflect “that children under 10 years may be less likely to become infected and spread infection, while those 10 years and older may spread it as efficiently as adults.”"", ""A recent South Korean study found that people were most likely to contract the new coronavirus from members of their own households, with children aged nine and under least likely to be the first identified case."", 
""Since most children infected with the coronavirus have very mild symptoms, they were largely overlooked as a demographic in the earlier stages of the pandemic, Dr. Fasano said."", ""The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported a pediatric COVID-19 hospitalization rate of 8 per 100,000 for March 1 to July 25, compared with a rate of 164.5 per 100,000 for adults."", ""Experts say the incidence of a related disease, which can develop after COVID-19 infection, multisystem inflammatory syndrome, is concerning. “The number of these patients is growing,” Dr. Fasano added."",

A small UK study found that the rate of diabetes almost doubled during the peak of Britain’s COVID-19 epidemic, suggesting a possible link between the two diseases that needs more investigation."", ""“The more we understand, the more it boils down to nobody is spared in this pandemic,” Dr. Fasano said."

A randomized, controlled trial of remdesivir in 584 moderately ill COVID-19 patients hospitalized with pneumonia yielded disappointing results in research published on Friday in JAMA. Compared to standard care without remdesivir, a 10-day course of the drug did not show a statistically significant effect on disease course at 11 days after treatment started, the study found. A five-day remdesivir course did make a statistically significant difference, but one so small that the researchers are not sure it really matters. Several other gold-standard trials are still underway, but as of now important questions remain regarding remdesivir's efficacy, Erin McCreary and Derek Angus of the University of Pittsburgh wrote in an editorial published alongside the study. They raised questions about whether some patients get more benefit from remdesivir than others and whether it matters if patients receive remdesivir and steroids together. It is still possible that remdesivir could improve recovery for millions of patients hospitalized with COVID-19, they added, but more research is needed before that becomes clear. Remdesivir is currently sold under an emergency-use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treating patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19. Gilead has filed an application seeking full FDA approval. (bit.ly/2E59k3T; bit.ly/32cQHTF; reut.rs/34p4HfA)"", 
""Breast milk an unlikely source of COVID-19 transmission"", ""Transmission of the novel coronavirus to infants through breast milk appears unlikely, a new study indicates. Researchers analyzed 64 breast milk samples from 18 infected mothers. One sample contained inactive genetic material from the virus, but none of the samples contained active virus particles, the researchers reported on Wednesday in JAMA. Even if breast milk became contaminated during pumping and handling, the virus is inactivated by Holder pasteurization, a standard process at human milk banks that involves heating the milk to a certain temperature and then cooling it. In theory, mothers could do this themselves, but \""good hygiene as recommended\"" is the best approach, study co-author Lars Bode of the University of California, San Diego told Reuters. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has advised nursing mothers with possible or confirmed COVID-19 to wear a cloth face covering while breast-feeding a baby and wash hands before touching the child and any pump or bottle parts.

""Maintain indoor humidity to limit airborne coronavirus"", ""Keeping indoor humidity levels between 40% and 60% will help limit airborne transmission of the novel coronavirus by minimizing the presence of infectious viral droplets in the air, according to a new study. The authors said that as the amount of water vapor in the air rises, viral droplet size increases and the heavier droplets fall from the air more quickly, providing less chance for other people to inhale them and become infected. By contrast, when humidity is low, the virus-containing droplets dry out - but the small infectious virus particles survive, floating in the air for longer periods and flying further through the room, depending on ventilation conditions, the researchers said in the journal Aerosol and Air Quality Research. Dry air also dries out the mucous membranes in the nose and makes them more permeable to viruses. Authorities should include humidity factors in future indoor guidelines, study co-author Dr. Sumit Kumar Mishra of CSIR - National Physical Laboratory in New Delhi said in a press statement. The findings are relevant not just in cold winter climates, his team said. Countries in tropical and hot climates should take care that indoor rooms are not dried out by overcooling with air conditioning. (bit.ly/32eAe15)"",

For example, they said, many hospitals have volunteers who provide educational services. Currently, patients have lost access to these tutors.

The findings, reported in the journal Laryngoscope, are based on data from 39 patients in Hong Kong who developed problems smelling or tasting - or both. On average, it took 10 days for these senses to return. Four to six weeks after becoming ill, 72% had completely recovered the ability to smell and 83% were able to taste again.

To their surprise, patients admitted with GI symptoms had 50% lower odds of severe COVID-19 and death, compared to patients without GI symptoms, even after accounting for age, race, and underlying medical conditions. Also unexpectedly, patients with GI involvement had lower levels of inflammatory proteins in their blood. A subset who underwent closer inspection of their intestines had virus particles in gut tissues, but relatively little inflammation, and low activity of genes responsible for making inflammatory proteins, doctors found, according to a paper posted on medRxiv on Wednesday ahead of peer review.

""Antibody-binding might not ‘neutralize’ the virus"", ""A so-called spike protein on the surface of the new coronavirus helps it invade cells, and some antibodies being tested as treatments work by attaching to the spike and disabling it. But researchers have discovered in test-tube experiments that merely binding to the spike protein is not necessarily enough to \""neutralize\"" the ability of the virus to break into cells. When they exposed coronavirus particles to antibody-rich plasma from 25 people recovering from COVID-19, all of the antibodies attached themselves to the spike protein. However, a few plasma samples failed to neutralize the virus and were no more effective than plasma from uninfected people. The findings might help explain why convalescent plasma therapy does not always work, the researchers say. They did not use active virus particles for their experiments.

""New system groups hospitalized COVID-19 patients by risk"", ""A simple 21-point scoring system helps assign hospitalized COVID-19 patients to different risk groups, UK researchers reported on Wednesday in The BMJ. \""The score does not require an app or any other technology, beyond perhaps a pen or pencil if you can't count up to 21 in your head,\"" Dr. Calum Semple of the University of Liverpool told Reuters. The score takes 8 factors into account including age, other illnesses, kidney health, and oxygen levels in the blood. Based on the result, patients are assigned to one of four groups. The risk of dying from COVID-19 is 1% in the low-risk group, 10% in the intermediate-risk group, 31% in the high-risk group, and 62% in the very high-risk group. The ISARIC Coronavirus Clinical Characterization Consortium developed its \""4C\"" scoring system using data from 35,463 patients and validated its accuracy in another 22,361 patients. As pressures on health services increase, being able to identify patients most likely to need escalated care becomes particularly important, Semple said in a news release.

While azithromycin did not appear to do any harm, after 15 days it was not associated with any patient improvement nor did it reduce their risk of death. In an April survey of more than 6,000 physicians in 30 countries, azithromycin was the second most commonly prescribed treatment for COVID-19, the study investigators wrote in The Lancet medical journal.

That was before visitor restrictions and universal masking rules had been implemented. The other patient developed symptoms four days after leaving the hospital. The source of the infection is not known. According to a paper published on Wednesday in JAMA Network Open, infection control efforts at the hospital included dedicated COVID-19 units with airborne infection isolation rooms, personal protective equipment for staff and monitoring to make sure those were used correctly, universal masking, visitor restriction, and liberal COVID-19 testing of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. These \""robust and rigorous infection control practices may be associated with minimized risk\"" of COVID-19 spreading through hospitals, the authors conclude.

""Further, nobody has died from the disease in Singapore for more than two months, according to its health ministry. The country’s leading disease experts said the following are the main factors behind the phenomenon:"", ""About 95% of Singapore’s COVID-19 infections are among migrant workers, mostly in their 20s or 30s, living in cramped dormitories and employed in labour-intensive sectors such as construction and shipbuilding."", ""While the parameters of the disease continue to be studied as the pandemic progresses, current global trends suggest its impact has been less severe for younger people, many of whom show few or no symptoms."", 
""Singapore has managed to mitigate the spread of the virus via early detection using aggressive contact tracing and testing that won praise from the World Health Organization (WHO)."", ""It has swabbed nearly 900,000 people, more than 15% of its 5.7 million population, according to official data - one of the highest per capita rates globally."", ""Dormitory residents have been put on a rostered testing regime, authorities have undertaken mass testing among vulnerable communities like care homes, and anyone over 13 with signs of acute respiratory infection is offered a free test."", 
""“The more we diagnose, then the lower the mortality rate is,” said Hsu Li Yang at Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health at National University of Singapore."", ""The pre-emptive approach has also applied to treatment. COVID-19 patients above the age of 45 years or with underlying conditions that make them vulnerable are cared for in hospital even if they are otherwise well, doctors said."", ""“Our care is conventional but done well; fluid management, anticoagulation and both proven drugs and participation in drug trials,” said Dale Fisher, a senior consultant at Singapore’s National University Hospital."", 
""Singapore was already a medical tourism hub for Southeast Asia, with numerous private hospitals and high quality public healthcare facilities.

Now faraway doctors are helping treat the community’s COVID-19 patients, thanks to technology."", ""KershawHealth, the local hospital, installed cameras and other equipment for 24-hour monitoring by a company that employs doctors and nurses remotely. Sitting in cubicles in St. Louis, Houston and Honolulu, as well as other countries including Israel and India, these medical workers watch patients’ vital signs on computer screens and talk to local staff on two-way video about medications and treatments. KershawHealth employees can summon emergency help from these teleworkers by hitting a button on the wall."", 
""Holmstrom said those changes, begun four years ago, have helped her hospital better handle the current crisis. While Camden and surrounding Kershaw County have seen more than 1,600 confirmed infections and 34 deaths, the technology has enabled many of the area’s COVID-19 patients to be hospitalized close to home."", ""“Now a patient can look up from their ICU bed here and they are seeing a friend’s daughter or son taking care of them or someone they go to church with,” said Holmstrom, chief medical officer at KershawHealth."", 
""Camden is among a growing number of communities relying on this elaborate form of telemedicine to cope with an unrelenting COVID-19 case load and to manage unpredictable surges."", ""Well before the current crisis, vast stretches of rural America lacked easy access to advanced medical care. More than 130 rural hospitals have closed in the United States since 2010, including 18 last year, according to University of North Carolina researchers."", ""Rural areas tend to have higher rates of underlying health conditions such as diabetes and hypertension. Their populations often are older and poorer – making them more vulnerable to COVID-19."", 
""Even if beds were available, qualified staff are hard to find. It’s estimated that 43 states, including South Carolina, face a shortage of highly trained ICU doctors, known as intensivists, according to researchers at George Washington University. These shortages may worsen with hospitalizations in many states predicted to peak this fall, when the coronavirus mixes with flu season, according to Patricia Pittman, director of the university’s Mullan Institute for Health Workforce Equity."", ""“No one is suggesting telemedicine is ideal, but it’s probably one of the least bad options,” she said. “It is definitely better than having no one and helicoptering people out.”"", 
""About a third of U.S. hospitals surveyed in 2017 said they had access to a formal program of telemedicine for critically ill patients. Studies have shown telemedicine can benefit ICU patients by promoting the best practices supported by medical evidence and by reducing complications. During the pandemic, doctors say, it has helped conserve personal protective equipment and reduce workers’ exposure to the virus."", ""There can be drawbacks, too, if physicians try to monitor too many people at once, which can lead to poor decisions or even medical errors. Tele-ICU generally requires physicians working remotely to hold a license in each state where people are hospitalized."", 
""The Trump administration has eased rules on telehealth during the pandemic and expanded reimbursement by Medicare. Shares of telemedicine companies such as Teladoc Health Inc have soared as patients embraced online visits."", ""Sutter Health, a large hospital system in California, said it manages more than 300 ICU beds across 18 hospitals from offices in Sacramento and San Francisco."", ""Earlier this month at its Sacramento hub, Dr. Vanessa Walker checked in remotely on a patient who was taken off a ventilator earlier in the day at Sutter’s Roseville hospital about 25 miles away. Using a headset and camera, she clicked the patient’s name on her screen, which rang a doorbell to notify the patient that she was entering the room via video."", 
""“Save your breath. You’re doing well otherwise,” she told the patient."", ""Walker, the medical director of Sutter’s electronic ICU for its hospitals in California’s Central Valley, had a wide array of information across six monitors at her desk. She could review medical records and see multiple scans of the patient’s lungs before and after treatment."", ""As use of this technology grows, patient-safety advocates warn hospitals not to cut corners. They say cameras and computers are no substitute for trained professionals at the bedside who can respond rapidly to life-threatening complications."", 
""The Leapfrog Group, a nonprofit that monitors patient safety, recommends that a physician certified in critical care medicine perform an in-person review of each ICU patient daily before handing off monitoring to colleagues remotely. The group says remote doctors should lower their patient loads if they can’t respond within five minutes to requests from on-site staff and evaluate the patient."", ""Steve Burrows, a Los Angeles filmmaker, remains a skeptic."", ""He said his mother had complications during a hip operation in 2009 and suffered permanent brain damage in surgery and the ICU at a Wisconsin hospital."", 
""In litigation, Burrows said, he learned that a doctor was remotely monitoring more than 150 ICU patients, and there was no physician in the ICU who could respond to his mother’s low blood pressure. He released an HBO documentary, “Bleed Out,” in 2018 about his mother’s case."", ""“Telemedicine is fantastic if it’s used properly,” he said in an interview. “But I think replacing doctors at the bedside with technology is insane.”"", ""At trial, a jury found there was no negligence by the hospital. Advocate Aurora Health, the current hospital owner after a merger, said its electronic ICU “does not replace bedside caregivers. Instead, it serves as an additional set of eyes that provides an extra layer of safety.”"", 
""‘CONSTANT ATTENTION’"", ""Advanced ICU Care, the St. Louis company serving Camden, works with more than 90 hospitals in 26 states. Overall, it has treated more than 1,300 COVID-19 patients."", ""“These patients need constant attention and continuous adjustments. That is a lot of what we do,” said Dr. Ram Srinivasan, the company’s chief medical officer."", ""South Carolina remains a hot spot for coronavirus infections with more than 126,000 cases and 2,877 confirmed deaths as of September 11."", ""The state’s first two cases of COVID-19 were announced the same day in early March and one was in Camden, a place so rural that signs remind people not to ride horses on the sidewalk."", 
""Holmstrom, the chief medical officer at KershawHealth, got a call with the news while driving home that Friday, March 6. Within a matter of days, there were six people infected and four were hospitalized."", ""The Camden ICU was nearly full for weeks as the medical staff juggled COVID-19 patients alongside the normal flow of critically ill people. Hospitalizations eased around Memorial Day, Holmstrom said, only to surge again in July and much of August."", ""“When you’re a town this small and 32 people get sick in one day that’s a lot,” said Vic Carpenter, Kershaw County administrator."", 
""Holmstrom, who was born in the hospital where she now works, has experienced highs and lows. A close friend who spent six weeks in the hospital is now back to full strength. Holmstrom arranged final video calls for others to say goodbye to their families."", ""KershawHealth is bracing for another surge this fall, when it once again will turn to remote doctors to back up busy hospital staff."", ""“It’s like someone constantly in the background overlooking everything with your care,” Holmstrom said."

Being present bedside in the hospital, attending funerals, and even simple hugs and the company from friends is often impossible."", ""“There’s a grief tsunami,” said Dr. Toni Miles, a professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of Georgia."", ""Every COVID-19 death in the United States results in about nine survivors who have lost a grandparent, parent, sibling, spouse or child, Pennsylvania State associate sociology professor Ashton Verdery and other researchers wrote in a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in July."", 
""And swift, unexpected deaths like many of those from COVID-19 can be a potent trigger for depression, anxiety, and substance abuse, which can manifest in myriad ways - including absenteeism, accidents, alcoholism, assault and self harm, experts said."", ""They can fuel rumination about what could have been different which, left unchecked, can derail the grieving process, said Dr. Katherine Shear, director of the Center for Complicated Grief at Columbia University."", ""“Whenever anyone dies suddenly, a person is going to say, ‘If only …’,” Shear said."", 
""The United States has lost almost 70 times more people to the pandemic than it lost in the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, the anniversary of which the nation stopped to mourn earlier this month."", ""So far, there has been no pause yet to collectively mark the losses from the pandemic - an important moment, experts say - perhaps because the death toll is still climbing. By year’s end, COVID-19 deaths could top 378,000, according to a projection from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington."", 
""That would be close to the number of American military deaths during World War Two."", ""The losses have been particularly pronounced in Hispanic and Black communities, and among the elderly and front line workers."", ""At the end of May, a research report from Yale University found: “Nationally, the new age-adjusted analysis shows Black people are more than 3.5 times more likely to die of COVID-19 than white people, and Latino people are nearly twice as likely to die of the virus as white people.”"",

Five days later, Rosemary, 82, succumbed to the illness."", ""In all, eight members of the family were infected."", ""“It went the whole gamut,” said Lisa Terio-Heath. “My sister, taking care of my mother, caught it. Then she gave it to her son and her son gave it to his partner. And my brother gave it to his wife. And my other brother caught it and gave it to his wife.”"", 
""“Nobody could help each other. Everybody was sick,” she said. “It was just a really hard, horrible, horrible situation.”"", ""While mourning her parents’ deaths, Terio-Heath said she is simultaneously angry at politicians who downplay the pandemic and anyone reluctant to wear a face covering that experts say is one of the most effective tools available to guard against the spread of the deadly disease."", ""“Put a mask on so that you never have to suffer what I went through or know that you possibly contributed to that,” Terio-Heath said. “Don’t be selfish.” (This story corrects age of Angelica Mendez in paragraph 16)"""

To learn more about how the body responds to COVID-19, researchers obtained serial \""snapshots\"" of patients' immune health by analyzing their immune cells at multiple points during their hospital stays. In COVID-19 patients with more severe disease, the monocytes do not function properly, researchers reported last week in Science Immunology. It was not yet clear whether the monocytes are being released from the bone marrow in an altered state or whether the alterations happen after monocytes enter the blood, coauthor Tracy Hussell of the University of Manchester in the UK told Reuters. Either way, she said, treatments that prevent their release from the bone marrow may help reduce the exaggerated immune response that contributes to poor outcomes in patients with severe COVID-19.

""COVID-19 reinfections occur, but remain rare"", ""Another case of reinfection after recovery from COVID-19 has been reported, this time in a healthy young military healthcare provider at a U.S. Department of Defense hospital in Virginia. He was first infected by a patient in March. He recovered within 10 days and \""returned ... to excellent health,\"" his doctors reported on Saturday in Clinical Infectious Diseases. Fifty-one days later, he was reinfected by a household member. Genetic studies showed the first and second infections to be from slightly different strains of the virus. The reinfection made him sicker, perhaps because the second strain was more potent, or the household contact infected him with a higher load of virus, doctors said. It was also possible antibodies from the first infection may have triggered his immune system to respond more strongly to the virus the second time his body encountered it. COVID-19 reinfections are still rare, they said. Kristian Anderson, professor of immunology and microbiology at Scripps Research in La Jolla, California, recently told Reuters virus reinfections are always possible. \""We don't know at what frequency reinfections (with the new coronavirus) occur and how that might change over time,\"" Anderson said. Without further studies, \""we can't conclude what a single case of reinfection means for longevity and robustness of COVID-19 immunity and relevance for a future vaccine,\"" she added. (bit.ly/2RN3FT0)"", 
""Proven immunotherapy approach might be possible in COVID-19"", ""A proven approach to severe virus infections, known as cytotoxic T cell therapy, may be applicable to COVID-19 despite a potential hurdle, researchers said. The approach involves treating critically ill patients with infusions of key immune cells known as T-lymphocytes obtained from people who successfully fought off the same virus. These donor T cells have learned to recognize and target the invading virus. But steroids, which are being increasingly used to treat COVID-19 patients, are toxic to lymphocytes, likely canceling out any beneficial effects of the immunotherapy. In a new report posted on bioRxiv ahead of peer review, researchers describe a possible workaround. They say they have figured out a way to take donor T cells that target the novel coronavirus and make them resistant to the deadly effects of steroids. \""We are currently working on ... developing clinical trials to determine safety and efficacy,\"" coauthor Dr. Katy Rezvani of The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center told Reuters.

""High COVID-19 mortality seen in assisted-living facilities"", ""Data compiled from more than 4,600 assisted living facilities in seven U.S. states through the end of May showed a four-fold higher COVID-19 fatality rate than in the nearby communities, researchers reported on Monday in the Journal of the American Geriatric Society. In North Carolina and Connecticut, for example, the proportions of COVID-19 cases that were fatal across the state were 3.3% and 9.3%, respectively. In assisted living facilities in those states, the fatality rate climbed to 13% and 31.6%. Unlike nursing homes, assisted living communities are not subject to federal regulation and are not required to collect and report data on COVID-19, coauthor Helena Temkin-Greener of the University of Rochester School of Medicine & Dentistry said in a news release. In this study, and in a separate study of nursing homes her team published on Monday in the same journal, COVID-19 cases were more common in facilities with more minority residents and more residents with dementia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and obesity. \""Assisted living communities and their residents urgently need local, state, and the federal governments to pay at least the same level of attention as that given to nursing homes,\"" Temkin-Greener and colleagues conclude.

It is something many vaccine-makers have sought to avoid, by asking for full indemnity - complete protection from liability claims - from nations they sell to."",

""For example, British drugmaker AstraZeneca AZN.L, which has developed a vaccine with Oxford University, has been granted full protection from any future liability claims by many countries with which it has signed supply deals, a senior executive told Reuters in July."", ""Dmitriev’s comments came after some scientists expressed concerns about the safety and efficacy of Sputnik-V, which the Russian government approved for use before completing large-scale human trials."", ""Sputnik-V was developed by Moscow’s Gamaleya Institute, a state research body.

The company’s registered address, Reuters found, is a small residence in a working-class part of the city."", 
""When Rio received a small batch of the ventilators from the company at the end of March, hospital workers complained to SES that the machines lacked key components, prosecutors said in the court documents summarizing their findings. The documents did not make clear in which hospital the health workers were stationed."", ""Arc Fontoura did not respond to phone calls or e-mails or receive Reuters at its listed address."", ""On April 1, SES awarded contracts worth a combined 116 million reais ($20.9 million) to two other firms - MHS Produtos e Servicos and A2A Comercio - to supply 300 ventilators each."", 
""Rio prosecutors quickly identified irregularities, according to court documents, starting with the timing of the companies’ bids. <U+202F>The little-known enterprises submitted their proposals less than an hour after SES opened the tender, which was not advertised beforehand, a sign the firms had been tipped off, prosecutors said."", ""By May 8, Rio’s state health department said publicly that of the 1,000 ventilators it had ordered, just 52 had been delivered, all from Arc Fontoura. SES said in early May it had canceled its contract with A2A because of “the company’s inability to deliver” the ventilators. A2A did not respond to requests for comment."", 
""MHS owner Glauco Guerra<U+202F> denied wrongdoing. He<U+202F>said in an email that his company had significant experience providing services to federal agencies. He said he submitted his bid a day after the tender was opened, not within a few hours, as prosecutors had alleged. Guerra said SES entered his bid documents into its computer system in a way that led prosecutors to misinterpret the timeline."", ""He said 97 ventilators were delivered to SES<U+202F>on June 6, and that the agency later canceled the contract for the remainder. State prosecutors confirmed in public documents seen by Reuters that 97 ventilators ordered by MHS had arrived at a Rio airport in early June."", 
""SES said in a statement to Reuters that all contracts signed “during the pandemic are being audited and revised,” adding that any irregularities will be punished. The ministry declined to comment on <U+202F>MHS’ claim that its bid documents were entered into the SES system in a misleading fashion, citing ongoing investigations into the matter."", ""Archer, the surgeon, says his experience battling COVID-19 without enough ventilators has left him bitter."", ""During the peak of the pandemic<U+202F>in April and May, he said as many as 30 patients in his care were waiting for the machines.

Using a powerful imaging technique called electron cryo-microscopy, they studied the molecular structure of the virus and found the pocket, with a small molecule, linoleic acid (LA), buried inside. LA molecules are critical to the immune functions \""that go haywire in COVID-19,\"" coauthor Imre Berger from the Max Planck-Bristol Centre for Minimal Biology in the UK said in a news release. \""And the virus that is causing all this chaos, according to our data, grabs and holds on to exactly this molecule - basically disarming much of the body's defenses.\"" In a paper published on Monday in Science, researchers note that common-cold-causing rhinoviruses have a similar pocket, and drugs that fit into the pocket by mimicking fatty acids like LA have lessened symptoms in human clinical trials. This suggests, they say, that drugs developed to target the pocket on the coronavirus spike protein might help eliminate COVID-19. (bit.ly/32VGXyF)"", 
""Only 1 in 5 infected with COVID-19 remain asymptomatic"", ""Most people infected with the new coronavirus will have symptoms, according to researchers who reviewed data from nearly 80 studies of individuals with positive PCR tests for COVID-19. Overall, just 20% remained asymptomatic. Five of the studies provided enough data for the researchers to examine the spread of the disease. Compared to COVID-19 patients with symptoms, patients who never developed symptoms were 65% less likely to transmit the virus to others, the researchers reported on Tuesday in the journal PloS Medicine. \""A minority of people has truly asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and, if they are less infectious than people with symptoms, they probably account for a relatively small proportion of all transmission,\"" coauthor Dr. Nicola Low of the University of Bern told Reuters. \""Most people will go on to develop symptoms and there is a substantial amount of transmission during the pre-symptomatic phase,\"" Low said. That means prevention measures to reduce transmission, including face covering, social distancing, physical barriers and widespread testing and contact tracing to find and isolate contagious people remains necessary. (bit.ly/2RRypSV)"", 
""Heart attack treatment has slowed during pandemic"", ""The average time from when a heart attack starts to when treatment begins has gotten longer during the pandemic, and researchers attribute most of the delay to patients' fears of contracting COVID-19 if they go to a hospital. In a study published in the American Journal of Emergency Medicine, doctors in China found the average time from symptom onset to first contact with a healthcare provider was about an hour longer in January to April 2020 than during the same period in 2019. And this year, after arrival at the hospital, the time until a blocked artery was reopened was 22 minutes longer - and more heart attack patients died, the authors say. Coauthor Dr. Ming-Wei Wang from Affiliated Hospital of Hangzhou Normal University told Reuters patients need to understand the importance of getting to a hospital quickly, and COVID-19 screening at hospitals should be hastened for patients with chest pain. Dr. Aditya Kapoor from India's Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences, who was not involved in the study, said other studies have found similar delays. \""Resource and manpower allocation to COVID-19 treatment, lockdown restrictions, and patient apprehensions related to hospital visits all play an important role,\"" he said.

She said no one else got infected in the family or at Bible Missionary Church, which could not be reached for comment."", 
""JBS, the world’s largest meatpacker, denied the family’s application for workers’ compensation benefits, along with those filed by the families of two other Greeley workers who died of COVID-19, said lawyers handling the three claims. Families of the three other Greeley workers who died also sought compensation, a union representative said, but Reuters could not determine the status of their claims."", ""JBS has said the employees’ COVID-19 infections were not work-related in denying the claims, according to responses the company gave to employees, which were reviewed by Reuters."", 
""As more Americans return to workplaces, the experience of JBS employees shows the difficulty of linking infections to employment and getting compensation for medical care and lost wages."", ""“That is the ultimate question: How can you prove it?” said Nick Fogel, an attorney specializing in workers’ compensation at the firm Burg Simpson in Colorado."", ""The meatpacking industry has suffered severe coronavirus outbreaks, in part because production-line workers often work side-by-side for long shifts. Companies including JBS, Tyson Foods Inc and WH Group Ltd’s Smithfield Foods closed about 20 plants this spring after outbreaks, prompting President Donald Trump in April to order the plants to stay open to ensure the nation’s meat supply. The White House declined to comment on the industry’s rejections of workers’ claims. The U.S. Department of Labor did not respond to a request for comment."", 
""Tyson has also denied workers’ compensation claims stemming from a big outbreak in Iowa, workers’ attorneys told Reuters. Smithfield workers at a plant in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, also hit by a major outbreak, have generally not filed claims, a union official said, in part because the company has paid infected workers’ wages and medical bills."", ""Smithfield declined to comment on workers’ compensation. Tyson said it reviews claims on a case-by-case basis, but declined to disclose how often it rejects them. JBS acknowledged rejecting claims but declined to say how often. It called the denials consistent with the law, without elaborating."", 
""Workers can challenge companies’ denials in an administrative process that varies by state but typically resembles a court hearing. The burden of proof, however, usually falls on the worker to prove a claim was wrongfully denied."", ""The full picture of how the meatpacking industry has handled COVID-related workers’ compensation remains murky because of a lack of national claims data. Reuters requested data from seven states where JBS or its affiliates have plants that had coronavirus outbreaks. Only three states provided data in any detail; all show a pattern of rejections."", 
""In Minnesota, where JBS had a major outbreak, meatpacking employees filed 930 workers’ compensation claims involving COVID-19 as of Sept. 11, according to the Minnesota Department of Labor and Industry. None were accepted, 717 were rejected and 213 were under review. The agency did not identify the employers."", ""The Minnesota Department of Health said only two meatpacking plants there had significant coronavirus outbreaks: a JBS pork processing plant in Worthington, and a poultry plant in Cold Spring run by Pilgrim’s Pride Corp, which is majority-owned by JBS."", 
""Tom Atkinson, a Minnesota workers’ compensation attorney who has represented meatpacking workers, estimates up to 100 COVID-19 claims were filed by employees at the Worthington plant."", ""In Utah, seven JBS workers filed claims related to COVID-19 by Aug. 1 and all were denied, according to the state’s Labor Commission. At least 385 workers at a JBS beef plant in Hyrum, Utah, tested positive for COVID-19."", ""In Colorado, 69% of the 2,294 worker compensation claims for COVID-19 had been denied as of Sept. 12. Although the state does not break down the denials by industry, a JBS spokesman told Reuters the company is rejecting claims in Colorado and that it uses the same claim-review procedures nationwide."", 
""JBS spokesman Cameron Bruett did not answer the question of whether JBS employees were infected on the job and declined comment on individual workers’ claims. He said the company has outsourced claim reviews to a third-party administrator."", ""“Given the widespread nature of viral spread, our third-party claims administrator reviews each case thoroughly and independently,” said Bruett."", ""The administrator, Sedgwick, did not respond to a request for comment. Bruett, also a spokesman for Pilgrim’s Pride, did not respond to questions about infections and claims at its Minnesota plant."", 
""At the JBS plant in Greeley, where Sanchez worked before he died, at least 291 of about 6,000 workers were infected, according to state data. The company, in its written response to the family’s claim, said that his infection was “not work-related,” without spelling out its reasoning. The two sides are now litigating the matter in Colorado’s workers’ compensation system."", ""Under Colorado law, a workers’ compensation death benefit provides about two-thirds of the deceased worker’s salary to the surviving spouse and pays medical expenses not covered by insurance. If JBS had not denied the Sanchez family’s claim, that would have provided his widow a steady income and paid uncovered medical bills totaling about $10,000, according to his daughter."", 
""“They don’t care,” Rangel said of JBS. “They are all about the big profits, and they are not going to give any money out.”"", ""The United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) International Union, which represents 250,000 U.S. meatpacking and food-processing workers, said last week at least 122 meatpacking workers have died of COVID-19 and more than 18,000 had missed work because they were infected or potentially exposed."", ""The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) said on Sept. 11 that it had cited JBS for failing to protect workers at the Greeley plant from the virus. OSHA cited Smithfield this month for failing to protect workers at its Sioux Falls, South Dakota, plant, where the agency said nearly 1,300 workers contracted the coronavirus and four died."", 
""Smithfield and JBS said the citations had no merit because they concerned conditions in plants before OSHA issued COVID-19 guidance for the industry. OSHA said it stands by the citations."", ""Workers’ compensation is generally the only way to recoup medical expenses and lost wages for work-related injuries and deaths. The system protects employers from lawsuits, with few exceptions, and allows workers to collect benefits without having to prove fault or negligence. But the system was designed for factory accidents, not airborne illnesses."", 
""In response to the coronavirus, governors and lawmakers in at least 14 states have made it easier for some employees to collect workers compensation for COVID-19 by putting the burden on companies and insurers to prove an infection did not occur at work. But most of the changes, which vary by state, only apply to workers in healthcare or emergency services. A similar proposal failed to gain support in Colorado."", ""Mark Dopp, general counsel for the North American Meat Institute, a trade association that represents meatpackers, said it is difficult to determine where workers get infections given extensive sanitation efforts taken by meat plants and workers’ daily travel to and from the plants."", 
""Tyson in April closed its Waterloo, Iowa, pork processing plant due to a COVID-19 outbreak. Ben Roth, a local workers’ compensation attorney, said five families of employees who died filed workers compensation claims for death benefits, and all were denied."", ""He said meat-processing companies have an incentive to deny every claim because admitting they caused even one infection can expose the firms to liability for all workers contracting COVID-19."", ""“That undercuts the argument that they want to make across the board: that you can’t prove you got it here and not at a grocery store,” Roth said."", 
""Tyson said it follows state laws for workers’ compensation. The company noted that Iowa law states that disease with an equal likelihood of being contracted outside the workplace are “not compensable as an occupational disease.”"", ""In Colorado, Sylvia Martinez runs a group called Latinos Unidos of Greeley and said she knows of more than 20 JBS workers who applied for workers compensation and were denied. Many plant workers are not native English speakers and sought out her group for guidance, she said, adding that many don’t understand their rights and fear being fired. The company’s rejections have discouraged more claims, Martinez said."", 
""“If you deny five or 10, those workers will tell their co-workers,” she said."", ""‘WHO IS GOING TO HIRE HIM?’"", ""JBS also contested the claim of Alfredo Hernandez, 55, a custodian who worked at the Greeley plant for 31 years. He became infected and was hospitalized in March. He still relies on supplemental oxygen and hasn’t returned to work, said his wife, Rosario Hernandez."", ""Generall y, companies approve claims if it looks probable that an employee was injured or sickened at work, said Erika Alverson, the attorney representing Hernandez. But JBS, she said, is arguing workers could have contracted COVID-19 anywhere."",

When they compared the genetic profiles of about 3,200 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and nearly 900,000 people from the general population, they found that a cluster of genes on chromosome 3 inherited from Neanderthals who lived more than 50,000 years ago is linked with 60% higher odds of needing hospitalization. People with COVID-19 who inherited this gene cluster are also more likely to need artificial breathing assistance, coauthor Hugo Zeberg of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology said in a news release. The prevalence of these genes varies widely, according to a report published on Wednesday in Nature. In South Asia, roughly 30% of people have them, compared to roughly one in six Europeans. They are almost non-existent in Africa and East Asia.

In laboratory experiments, researchers allowed several species of disease-carrying mosquitoes, plus some other biting insects, to feed on blood spiked with the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. The virus was unable to survive and replicate itself in any of the insects, they reported in a paper posted on Wednesday on bioRxiv ahead of peer review. \""Biting insects do not pose a risk for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to humans or animals,\"" the researchers said.

However, in MIS-C patients, the activated immune system quickly settles down, and symptoms improve, often faster than during a bout with COVID-19. Wherry noted a possible connection between a specific type of activated immune cell in children with MIS-C and some of the vascular complications seen in that condition as well as in COVID-19. \""The identification of an immune cell type connected to vascular symptoms may identify a new (treatment) target if approaches can be developed to target such cells,\"" he said.

The study, published on Tuesday in the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, also found that the risk for COVID-19 complications was higher among Blacks, Hispanics and other non-white patients, even after taking age and underlying medical conditions into consideration. These disparities \""provide further evidence that racial and ethnic minority groups are disproportionally affected by COVID-19,\"" the researchers said. (bit.ly/2Hm4wsf)"", 
""Open windows, glass partitions advised for classrooms"", ""Children would be safer from the new coronavirus if classrooms had glass or plastic partitions fastened to desks, open windows and air conditioning, researchers say. Using computers to map paths of potentially virus-containing aerosols through air, they found that nearly 70% of particles exhaled during speech would exit the room if windows were open. Barriers between desks roughly 8 feet (2.44 m) apart would further reduce transmission of those particles. Up to half of particles generated by coughing or sneezing either land on the floor or are cleared by air conditioning within 15 minutes, researchers reported on Tuesday in Physics of Fluids. \""Masks ... reduce the number of particles coming from a person and also change their initial velocity. Then you want social distancing and hand sanitizing. Then air conditioning, open windows and glass partitions,\"" study coauthor Khaled Talaat from the University of New Mexico told Reuters. \""No single layer will do the job.\"" Students at higher risk of COVID-19 complications can be seated where they are exposed to fewer particles, which would depend on the air conditioning layout within the room, the researchers noted. In their model, the back corners were the safest spots. (bit.ly/3kld3Ko)"", 
""Jury still out on benefits of convalescent plasma"", ""Pooled data from 19 studies involving more than 36,000 COVID-19 patients has yielded no definitive answer to whether infusions of blood plasma from people who have recovered from the disease is clinically beneficial, an expert panel reported. They searched medical databases to find studies testing the effectiveness of so-called convalescent plasma. \""We are uncertain\"" whether convalescent plasma reduces deaths in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and it makes \""little to no difference\"" in patients' symptoms such as need for breathing support within a week after receiving the treatment, researchers said in the report compiled for The Cochrane Library. After more time has elapsed, they said, an effect might become evident. In all cases, the reliability of the studies was \""uncertain,\"" and there was limited information about serious side effects of the treatment. They noted that more than 130 studies of convalescent plasma therapy were ongoing. \""We will continue to update this review,\"" they said. (bit.ly/3oo0Tmy)"", 
""Studies conflict on arthritis drug for COVID-19 pneumonia"", ""A handful of studies on whether the rheumatoid arthritis drug tocilizumab provides clinically meaningful benefit for hospitalized COVID-19 patients with pneumonia have produced conflicting data. The medicine - sold as Actemra by Swiss drugmaker Roche - is an antibody that helps control an inflammation-inducing protein produced by the immune system called IL-6. Because the life-threatening lung problems in severe COVID-19 are thought to be related to the immune system's inflammatory response to the virus, and because Chinese doctors saw higher death rates in patients with high IL-6 levels, hospitals began using tocilizumab in the hopes it might help dampen that response and hasten patients' recovery. Large \""observational\"" studies - including one published last week and two published on Tuesday - found that it appears to help. But two more-rigorous randomized trials published on Tuesday found tocilizumab made no difference in patients' recovery. An editorial published alongside three of the studies in JAMA Internal Medicine notes that the randomized trials had some weaknesses, and it may still turn out that \""blunting the immune response with tocilizumab will reduce morbidity and mortality over the long haul.\"" But for now, \""findings from the randomized trials ... do not support routine tocilizumab use in COVID-19.\"" (bit.ly/2HoJRUa; bit.ly/3dL5DO5; bit.ly/2TbY49N; bit.ly/3kvJoy0; bit.ly/2TgQdHP)"",

At 3 a.m. on Aug. 1, he passed out on the floor of his home in Mesa, Arizona."", ""Paramedics rushed him to a nearby hospital, where doctors put him in intensive care after saving him from a coma. They told him he could have died. Their diagnosis – type 1 diabetes – stunned and frightened him. He had no history of the disease."", 
""“COVID triggered it,” Buelna said the doctors told him."", ""Buelna’s ordeal and similar cases reflect a new worry about the dangerous relationship between diabetes and COVID-19 that’s being urgently studied by doctors and scientists around the world. Many experts are convinced that COVID-19 can trigger the onset of diabetes - even in some adults and children who do not have the traditional risk factors."", ""It’s already been well-documented that people with diabetes face much higher risks of severe illness or death if they contract COVID-19. In July, U.S. health officials found that nearly 40% of people who have died with COVID-19 had diabetes. Now, cases like Buelna’s suggest the connection between the diseases runs both ways."", 
""“COVID could be causing diabetes from scratch,” said Dr. Francesco Rubino, a diabetes researcher and chair of metabolic and bariatric surgery at King’s College London. Rubino is leading an international team that is collecting patient cases globally to unravel one of the biggest mysteries of the pandemic. Initially, he said, more than 300 doctors have applied to share cases for review, a number he expects to grow as infections flare up again."", ""“These cases are coming from every corner of the world and every continent,” Rubino told Reuters. In addition to the global registry, the U.S. National Institutes of Health is financing research into how the coronavirus may cause high blood sugars and diabetes."", 
""In these situations, symptoms can escalate quickly and become life threatening. These cases may take months to surface after exposure to COVID-19, so the full extent of the problem and the long-term ramifications may not be known until well into next year. More intensive research is needed to definitively prove, beyond the mounting anecdotal evidence, that COVID-19 is triggering diabetes on a wide scale."", ""“We have more questions than answers right now,” said Dr. Robert Eckel, president of medicine and science at the American Diabetes Association. “We could be dealing with an entirely new form of diabetes.”"", 
""‘ABSOLUTELY TERRIFYING’ DIAGNOSIS"", ""Type 1 diabetes occurs when the body’s immune system mistakenly destroys insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, preventing the regulation of blood sugar levels. About 1.6 million Americans have the disease."", ""Type 2 diabetes is more prevalent, afflicting about 30 million Americans. Those patients still produce insulin, but over time their cells become insulin-resistant, allowing blood sugar to rise."", ""Type 1 diabetes cases have previously been associated with other viral infections, including influenza and previous coronaviruses. It is known that infections can stress the body and increase blood sugar levels. But this tends to happen in people predisposed to the disease. Only some of them eventually develop diabetes, and scientists still don’t fully understand why."", 
""This year, doctors also are seeing some people without the risk factors for type 2 diabetes - such as being older or overweight - experience a diabetic emergency after exposure to COVID-19."", ""In type 1 diabetes, initial symptoms can include extreme thirst, fatigue, frequent urination and weight loss. Arthur Simis had no idea those were signs for the disease."", ""This summer, he and his wife, Sarah, noticed their 12-year-old son, Atticus, appeared thin and slept a lot. They figured he was stressed out from being trapped at home in the pandemic, or going through a growth spurt."", 
""On July 9, as his symptoms persisted, Arthur Simis took his son to an urgent care center near their home in Gardnerville, Nevada. The medical staff detected dangerously high blood sugar levels and ketones in his urine, both indicators that Atticus was in diabetic ketoacidosis, or DKA."", ""The doctor told Simis that his son needed hospital care immediately to avoid slipping into a coma from his newly diagnosed type 1. An ambulance took them 50 miles to the nearest hospital in Reno."", ""His father spent three nights sleeping at his side in the pediatric ICU. He sobbed on the phone to his wife, because only one parent was allowed inside, a measure to control coronavirus infections."", 
""“How could he have diabetes?” Simis recalls asking the doctors. “It was absolutely terrifying.”"", ""Simis believes his son had been infected by the coronavirus because the father and his wife experienced symptoms in the spring. The couple went to urgent care but never got tested for the coronavirus because of stricter testing criteria at the time. Atticus tested negative for an active coronavirus infection in the ICU, medical records show. But he was never tested for antibodies that could show whether he was exposed weeks earlier."", 
""Doctors say that’s not unusual in a fast-moving pandemic, as they focus on individual emergencies rather than big-picture research questions. But the lack of testing in many of these cases, they say, may complicate efforts to detect whether and how the coronavirus might be causing diabetes."", ""The initial reports of COVID-related diabetes include more children with cases like that of Atticus."", ""In a study published in August, researchers at Imperial College in London and several hospitals there found that cases of type 1 diabetes among children nearly doubled to 30 during late March to early June - as the pandemic raged - compared to the same period in previous years. Five of the children tested positive for a prior coronavirus infection, but the study’s authors said many of the children were not tested."", 
""In the United States, Children’s Hospital Los Angeles said the percentage of newly diagnosed type 2 patients who arrived in diabetic ketoacidosis, a potentially fatal buildup of acid in the blood, has nearly doubled for March through August compared to the same period in 2018 and 2019."", ""Dr. Lily Chao, director of the type 2 diabetes clinic there, said the hospital is still investigating whether this increase is driven by exposure to COVID-19."", ""Brandi Edwards, a registered nurse and diabetes educator at Alabama’s Huntsville Hospital, said calls about pediatric cases began to surge in May. Doctors summon her when a child arrives in the emergency room or ICU so she can counsel the family on insulin injections, glucose readings and how daily life will change going forward."", 
""“We’ve seen more type 1 cases this year than I ever remember,” Edwards said. “There were three kids in the pediatric ICU at the same time. That is so rare.”"", ""After surviving a diabetic emergency, life for a newly diagnosed patient can be overwhelming. Medication and other supplies to manage diabetes can cost hundreds of dollars every month, and long waits to see an endocrinologist are common in many areas."", ""Buelna, the patient in Arizona, is still waiting for his Medicaid plan to approve a continuous glucose monitor more than two months after his diagnosis. The disease knocked him out of work for weeks and wrecked his family’s finances. His wife, Erika, is eight months pregnant and they have a 3-year-old daughter, Katalina. The family got an eviction notice on Aug. 2, while Mario was in the ICU, and they rely on a food bank for some meals."", 
""Buelna said he fell into a depression in the hospital, cut off from family visits, and credits his sister with lifting his spirits in phone calls."", ""“I want to get better so I can see my kids grow up,” he said. “I’m not ready to go yet.” (Reporting by Chad Terhune Editing by Brian Thevenot)"

""Last month, a group of U.S. scientists warned in an open letter published in the medical journal Science that infected aerosols - small droplets and particles - lingering in the air could be a major source of COVID-19 transmission."", ""The letter called on public health officials to highlight the importance of moving activities outdoors and improving indoor air, along with wearing masks and social distancing."", ""“COVID-19’s favorite season is winter - like the seasonal flu, this virus loves the cold,” Gutter said."", 
""“Indoor air quality considerations will be of even greater importance in regions of the world that are preparing for winter.”"", ""The changes to the WELL recommendations highlight the need to limit touch as people move through a building, safely disinfect surfaces and more, in particular boosting indoor air quality, Gutter said."", ""Interest in the coronavirus guidance has been enormous, and implementation has been “lightning fast”, she said, adding that about 350 million square feet (32.5 million square meters) of space has been newly registered with the institute since June."", 
""Other building certification systems have rolled out new guidance, too, including LEED - or Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design - which focuses on environmental impact and has been widely adopted across the globe."", ""“The pandemic has really shone a spotlight on, ‘What is my indoor air quality like, and why does that matter?’” said Melissa Baker, senior vice president of LEED development at the U.S. Green Building Council, which oversees the system."", ""“These are the questions that tenants will be asking their landlords now.”"", 
""Months into the pandemic, designers are tracking changes in how people interact with buildings and trying to see how they can help make the indoors healthier, said Rachel Minnery, a senior director with the American Institute of Architects."", ""“Here we are, almost every building except your home is considered unsafe,” she said."", ""“What role can the built environment play ... so hopefully we’re not in quarantine for the next two years?”"", ""Design tweaks could start with a user’s entry into a building, Minnery noted, through vestibules and queuing areas to facilitate temperature checks or social distancing."", 
""Architects are also incorporating one-way doors and hallways, spreading workstations farther apart, deploying touchless technologies and upgrading air-filtration systems, she added."", ""The demands are forcing designers to learn about a range of new issues."", ""“I’m not an epidemiologist - I’m an architect,” said Jenine Kotob, who works just outside Washington with Hord Coplan Macht (HCM), a national firm."", ""When the pandemic hit, Kotob and her colleagues started participating in emergency workshops with public health experts."", 
""“They defined for us a baseline of understanding, the knowledge base that any architect now needs to be aware of: how infectious diseases are transferred,” she said."", ""In a survey of real estate experts around the world released by the Washington D.C.-based nonprofit Urban Land Institute in October, 90% of respondents said certification of healthy offices will likely rise in coming years."", ""The pandemic is also shifting thinking in terms of how buildings can help with the way communities function more broadly, from wellbeing to work."", 
""“The thing that’s different about COVID is we’re focusing not only on physical wellness but also emotional wellbeing,” said Donald Powell, a partner at the BOKA Powell architecture firm based in Texas."", ""“That’s the hurdle all corporations have to cross before employees will come back to the workplace.”"", ""In response to client queries on how to entice workers back to the office, Powell said he and his colleagues are considering on-site child care and even classrooms, aimed at parents who are home-schooling and want to come back to work."", 
""Schools have been a high-profile point of contention throughout the pandemic, and a growing number in the United States are contemplating how to open back up."", ""“Without school buildings able to come back online during the pandemic, the longer we stretch it out, the longer we will see repercussions to our society,” said HCM’s Kotob."", ""She and her colleagues are being asked to repurpose cafeterias, libraries and other large gathering spaces to create multiple smaller classrooms, all while adhering to local regulations and social distancing guidance, she said."", 
""The need for these changes has underscored the chronic underfunding of public schools, Kotob noted."", ""U.S. elementary facilities face a shortfall of $38 billion a year, according to advocacy group [Re]Build America’s School Infrastructure Coalition."", ""Pending legislation would provide $5 billion for emergency school repairs as part of a pandemic relief package, which could go toward improving sanitation and upgrading air-filtration systems, for example."", ""“What we’ve seen in the pandemic is there are specific issues that have gone unaddressed for so long - air quality, overcrowded conditions, access to the outdoors - that can’t be tabled any longer,” said Kotob."", 
""That kind of thinking is prompting broader recognition of the notion of health as a human right and its links with buildings, said Gutter at the International WELL Building Institute."", ""“Many of us have now been cooped up in our homes for months, so we’re much more tuned in to these impacts on our health,” she said."", ""“The way we build affordable housing, construct our schools - what would happen if we embraced the notion that these could enhance rather than take away from our health and wellbeing?”"""

Scientists studied 194 COVID-19 patients, including 55 with severe disease, plus a control group of 30 people without the virus. In the sickest patients, they found a high frequency of autoantibodies created by the immune system causing injury to the central nervous system, blood vessels, and connective tissues like cartilage, ligaments and tendons. They also found a high prevalence of autoantibodies that interfere with substances involved in the functioning of the immune system itself, including cytokines and other \""immunomodulatory\"" proteins. \""The surprising extent of autoantibody reactivities\"" in these patients indicates that these mistakenly targeted antibodies are \""an intrinsic aspect\"" of COVID-19.

In the preliminary study published on Thursday in PLoS One, dogs who sniffed swab samples of armpit sweat could tell which samples came from COVID-19 patients and which were from people who tested negative for the new coronavirus. That study was conducted in March. More recently, the researchers have validated the findings in additional trials, said study leader Dominique Grandjean of Alfort Veterinary School in France. Dogs can identify infected individuals with 85% to 100% accuracy and rule out infection with 92% to 99% accuracy, Grandjean said. \""It takes one tenth of a second for a trained dog to say 'yes' or 'no',\"" he said. Training requires 3 to 8 weeks depending on whether the dog is already trained for odor detection. COVID-19-detecting dogs have already been deployed in airports in the United Arab Emirates, Grandjean said.

""COVID-19 not linked with Guillain-Barré syndrome"", ""COVID-19 is not associated with the potentially paralyzing disorder Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), a large UK study shows. In GBS, the immune system mistakenly attacks nerves in the feet, hands and limbs. Smaller studies have suggested a link between COVID-19 and GBS. But when researchers compared the number of GBS cases recorded in the UK's National Health Service database in 2016 to 2019 to the number recorded in the first half of 2020, they found the annual incidence was 40% to 50% lower during the pandemic. \""No causal link of COVID-19 to GBS can be made,\"" Stephen Keddie of University College London said in a statement. His team reported on Monday in the journal Brain that they also looked for - but could not find - any genetic or protein structure in the new coronavirus that might trigger an immune response causing GBS, which is good news for vaccine development. \""Most COVID-19 vaccinations are based on the (coronavirus') spike protein, which drives a complex immune response creating antibodies to fight infection,\"" Keddie said.

According to preliminary data published on Monday on medRxiv ahead of peer review, patients who were randomly assigned to receive azithromycin did no better than patients who got standard care in terms of deaths, duration of hospitalization, or need for mechanical ventilation. \""More than 75% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients are prescribed antibiotics,\"" the researchers point out. \""Although we detected no harm to individual patients treated with azithromycin, there is a risk of harm at a societal level from widespread use of antimicrobial agents,\"" researchers said.

In another study published on Wednesday in The BMJ, U.S. researchers found people being hospitalized for COVID-19 carried higher risks of organ failure and death, and increased health resource use, compared to people hospitalized for the flu.

""Oxygen-monitoring devices less reliable in Black patients"", ""COVID-19 can cause blood oxygen levels to fall to dangerously low levels, and devices used to monitor these levels are far less reliable in Black patients than in white patients, a large study found. So-called pulse oximeters clip onto a fingertip and pass red and infrared light through the skin to gauge oxygen levels in the blood, which darkens when levels drop. Because pulse oximeters were mostly tested on whites when they were developed, they are calibrated for people with light skin. Among 1,609 patients studied this year at the University of Michigan Hospital in Ann Arbor, the devices missed low oxygen levels in 11.7% of Black patients compared to 3.6% of white patients. When the researchers studied another 8,392 patients treated at 178 intensive-care units in 2014-2015, they found pulse oximeters missed low oxygen levels in 17.0% of Blacks versus 6.2% of whites. \""Given the widespread use of pulse oximetry for medical decision-making, these findings have some major implications, especially during the current COVID-19 pandemic,\"" the researchers warned on Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine. \""Reliance on pulse oximetry to triage patients and adjust supplemental oxygen levels may place Black patients at increased risk.\"" (bit.ly/3gDRjrZ; bit.ly/3gNjncy)"", 
""Minority COVID-19 patients may benefit from tocilizumab"", ""Among mostly non-white patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia, Roche's arthritis drug Actemra, also known as tocilizumab, reduced the odds of needing mechanical ventilation or dying. Among the 389 volunteers in a study, the combined risk of those events was 12% in patients randomly assigned to receive tocilizumab in addition to standard care, versus 19% in those who received a placebo. Looking only at the risk of death, however, rates in the two groups were similar, researchers reported on Thursday in The New England Journal of Medicine. Tocilizumab also did not hasten patients' discharge from the hospital or the time it took for their medical status to improve. Previous studies did not focus on racial or ethnic minorities and yielded mixed results. Earlier this month, a different team of doctors reported that the drug reduced patients' risk of dying in the hospital, but the difference was not statistically significant. The Infectious Diseases Society of America currently does not recommend routine use of tocilizumab in hospitalized patients. (bit.ly/2KHvITB)"",

Even if social distancing guidelines are followed, it might still be risky to follow someone down a narrow corridor, researchers advised in a report published on Tuesday in Physics of Fluids. \""The transmission of COVID-19 is highly influenced by the airflow,\"" said coauthor Xiaolei Yang of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing. \""A slight change of airflow can significantly alter the virus spreading pattern,\"" he said. Such changes can be caused by a minor difference in corridor width, walking speed, indoor architectural structure, temperature, humidity or other factors. Staying six feet (1.83 m) behind the person in front of you \""is not enough for narrow corridors, and wearing a face mask is recommended even if you do not see people around, he said.

Another 1,799 had pneumonia unrelated to COVID-19 and 3,505 had heart failure, conditions associated with high readmission rates. Within 10 days after discharge, roughly 14% of COVID-19 patients had been readmitted or died, compared to roughly 10% of the other patients, researchers reported on Monday in JAMA. By day 60 after discharge, roughly one in four COVID-19 patients had been readmitted or died, but the rate was slightly higher among the other patients. \""Recovery can be a bumpy road,\"" coauthor Dr. Hallie Prescott of University of Michigan Health System told Reuters.

""U.S. Black communities missing out on COVID-19 testing"", ""COVID-19 testing is essential for identification and isolation of infected people, but testing may be less common among U.S. Blacks than among whites, a Missouri study suggests. Between March and September, nearly one million COVID-19 tests were conducted in the St. Louis and Kansas City regions. In the first three months of that period, areas (identified by postal zip codes) with higher proportions of residents who were Black, without insurance, and with lower median incomes accounted for 25% of COVID-19 cases but only 9% to 12% of the tests performed for the virus, researchers found. \""Even within the same zip codes, testing rates were lower among Black residents compared to white residents,\"" said Dr. Aaloke Mody of Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. The disparities persisted through the summer, he said. \""Studies have repeatedly shown greater burden of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and mortality in minority communities,\"" Mody and colleagues wrote on Monday in Clinical Infectious Diseases. \""Testing disparities may be important driver of disparities in disease burden,\"" Mody said. \""We need proactive public health strategies that really help to ensure equitable testing, such as making community-based testing widely available.

U.S. health officials knew very little then about the mysterious new virus, and the quarantined group offered an early opportunity to size up the threat."", ""The federal government sought help from a team at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, including Dr. James Lawler, an experienced infectious disease specialist. Lawler told Reuters he immediately asked the world-renowned U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for permission to test the quarantined group, deeming it crucial to know whether people without symptoms were infected and could spread the deadly pathogen."", 
""Agency officials worried that detained people couldn’t give proper consent because they might feel coerced into testing. “CDC does not approve this study,” an official at the quarantine site wrote to Lawler in a Feb. 8 email obtained by Reuters. “Please discontinue all contact with the travelers for research purposes.”"", ""More than two months passed before the CDC expanded its testing guidelines to include all asymptomatic people, saying soon afterward that this silent spread “may meaningfully contribute to the propagation of the COVID-19 pandemic.” By November, the agency estimated that more than half of cases were spread by people not currently experiencing symptoms."", 
""Critics have widely asserted that the CDC fumbled key decisions during the coronavirus scourge because then-President Donald Trump and his administration meddled in the agency’s operations and muzzled internal experts. The matter is now the subject of a congressional inquiry. Yet Reuters has found new evidence that the CDC’s response to the pandemic also was marred by actions - or inaction - by the agency’s career scientists and frontline staff."", ""At a crucial moment in the pandemic when Americans were quarantined after possible exposure to the virus abroad, the agency declined or resisted potentially valuable opportunities to study whether the disease could be spread by those without symptoms, according to previously undisclosed internal emails, other documents and interviews with key players."", 
""Soon after balking at testing the returnees from Wuhan, the agency delayed testing asymptomatic passengers among 318 evacuees from the Diamond Princess, a contaminated cruise ship in Japan. In addition, the agency failed at that time to make effective use of outside experts and appeared at times unprepared for the crisis on the ground, lacking adequate personal protective gear and ignoring established protocols, Reuters found."", ""“Yes, they were interfered with politically,” said Lawrence Gostin, director of the O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University, referring to alleged meddling by the Trump administration. “But that’s not the only reason CDC didn’t perform optimally during COVID-19. There are a lot of things that went wrong.”"", 
""Four top public health experts or ethicists told Reuters that the question of whether to test or engage in research on detained people has always been a sensitive topic. But all said the CDC should have proceeded given the fast-moving public health emergency."", ""Moreover, the CDC finalized rules in 2017 providing that medical testing was expressly allowed in quarantine, as long as participants were given the opportunity to give “informed consent” or opt out. Informed consent means giving people adequate information to understand the risks and benefits of a test or procedure."", 
""Gostin said the CDC’s argument against testing was “unreasonable” under the circumstances. “You are asking for consent and not imposing any harm,” he said. “There is a good reason to do it.”"", ""It’s difficult to know whether more aggressive early testing among asymptomatic people would have significantly altered the trajectory of the pandemic in the United States, which has infected 24 million people and killed more than 400,000."", ""The CDC was not the only agency that struggled with this issue. Notably, an official with the World Health Organization called asymptomatic spread “very rare” in June, only to say a day later “we don’t actually have that answer yet.” In recent months, the WHO has said infected people without symptoms can be contagious, but “it is still not clear how frequently this occurs.”"", 
""Still, some countries such as South Korea and Singapore used widespread testing early on to identify infected people with or without symptoms and, unlike the United States, broadly required or distributed masks."", ""CDC scientists infamously botched the creation of a test for the coronavirus and took weeks trying to fix it, making widespread testing - well beyond those with symptoms - impossible during the pandemic’s first months."", ""In response to detailed inquiries from Reuters, a CDC spokesman said the agency declined to comment."", 
""In the final weeks of the Trump administration, White House officials did not respond to requests for comment on reports of political interference."", ""The problems within the CDC, which has suffered from a decade of declining funding, point to the steep challenge faced by newly inaugurated President Joe Biden and his CDC director, Rochelle Walensky, to rehabilitate the agency in the eyes of scientists, other public health officials and the public."", ""Walensky “acknowledges that work has to be done to restore public confidence” in the CDC, according to a Biden spokesperson."", 
""Dr. Sonja Rasmussen, who worked at the CDC for 20 years and at one point was responsible for pandemic influenza preparedness, said the agency’s staff are “among the most dedicated professionals in the world and they were doing the best they could under the toughest circumstances.”"", ""“This has been an incredibly challenging pandemic and it would have been hard for anyone to guess what would have happened,” she said."", ""But she and other public health specialists also told Reuters that Americans deserve a thorough examination of the agency’s shortcomings in the crisis."", 
""“We have to figure out what needs to be fixed before this happens again,” said Rasmussen, now a professor at the University of Florida."", ""On Feb. 7, a group of Americans arrived from Wuhan and the surrounding province at Camp Ashland, a National Guard base near Omaha and the University of Nebraska Medical Center, a major outpost in the nation’s defenses against bioterrorism and infectious diseases."", ""Infectious disease specialist Lawler, who worked in the George W. Bush and Obama administrations on pandemic response, suspected that some of the evacuees might be infected with the coronavirus and shedding it despite having no symptoms. His suspicions were based partly on scientific reports from Asia and Europe."", 
""Starting on Feb. 8, Lawler pressed the CDC to greenlight voluntary and limited coronavirus testing among this group, according to emails obtained by Reuters through the Freedom of Information Act."", ""Lawler had already won support for such testing from the U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) officials in charge of the returnees at Ashland, the Nebraska health department and his university’s medical faculty, emails show. HHS oversees the CDC."", ""Later that Saturday, Eric Kasowski, the CDC’s representative at Camp Ashland, emailed Lawler to tell him that his request to test the 57 people in quarantine “was very quickly elevated to Dr. (Anne) Schuchat, Principal Deputy Director, CDC,” who had worked at the agency for 32 years."", 
""Schuchat referred questions from Reuters to the CDC press office, which declined to comment."", ""The CDC’s answer to Lawler was no."", ""According to the Feb. 8 email: “It is CDC’s position that since the research is being proposed for a group of individuals who are detained under a federal quarantine order, the circumstances of voluntary participation would be extremely difficult to assure and therefore, CDC does not approve this study.”"", ""Lawler said he kept pressing Kasowski. But Kasowski told Lawler the next morning that the testing proposal had been rejected again, this time by officials up to and including CDC director Robert Redfield."", 
""“This is absurd,” Lawler recalled telling Kasowski."", ""Kasowski declined to comment, referring questions to the CDC."", ""Instead of having everyone tested during the two-week quarantine, only one returnee who became ill and was hospitalized got tested; the results were negative for coronavirus, Lawler said. The other 56 left quarantine without knowing whether they carried the virus, and Lawler said he knows of no CDC follow up with that group."", ""In a Feb. 10 email to Kasowski, Lawler warned that the federal government, by not testing symptomless individuals, “may be missing the submerged iceberg in the U.S.”"", 
""Within days, Lawler got a new federal assignment: to help evacuate more than 300 Americans stranded on the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in Yokohama, Japan."", ""He was joined there by Dr. Michael Callahan, a veteran infectious disease specialist from Massachusetts General Hospital, who had just been appointed a special advisor to HHS on COVID-19. Callahan, who says his two years of physician scientist training at the CDC in the mid-1990s inspired him to forgo academia for a field career battling disease outbreaks, had just treated coronavirus patients in China weeks earlier."", 
""Major problems emerged soon after Lawler and Callahan arrived in Yokohama on Feb. 14."", ""The U.S. team, including HHS and other U.S. personnel, had to borrow walkie talkies from Japanese authorities because they didn’t have mobile phones that worked internationally, according to an “after-action” report submitted by Lawler and Callahan in March to HHS and obtained by Reuters."", ""Japan had to lend the U.S. team basic protective gear because the Americans’ supplies didn’t arrive in time, the report said. Some team members were not trained for handling a “highly contagious disease.”"", 
""According to Callahan, he had to turn back two CDC staffers seeking to board the Diamond Princess in Japan because they had no current experience in emergency medicine and infection control."", ""Callahan said the problem was not isolated to the CDC’s coronavirus response. In his regular interactions in the field with CDC staff in recent years, he said, he has seen “a progressive degradation of clinical expertise and incident management,” particularly during Ebola outbreaks in Africa."", ""The CDC needs “people that can actually do public health when bad stuff happens,” Callahan said."", 
""On Feb. 17, Lawler flew with 151 cruise passengers to Lackland Air Force Base near San Antonio, Texas. An isolation bubble was created using a plastic curtain in the rear of the plane for five passengers who had tested positive for COVID-19 in Japan."", ""During the flight, Lawler moved two passengers who had become feverish to the isolation area, planning to take them to Nebraska Medical Center. But those precautions went awry when CDC personnel greeted the plane in Texas."", ""“The CDC officer in charge boarded the aircraft without consulting the flight crew regarding safety or contamination issues,” according to the after-action report."", 
""The officer’s personal protective equipment “was grossly insufficient due to the high level of contamination that likely existed on the aircraft. This likely put CDC personnel and other responders on the ground at risk.”"", ""What’s more, the CDC official moved the two people who had developed symptoms mid-flight back with the group of healthy passengers, and the CDC’s handling of the flight violated disaster medicine protocols, according to the report. The CDC official is not named in the report."", 
""Similar problems occurred when Callahan arrived with another group of 167 Diamond Princess passengers at Travis Air Force Base in Northern California and a CDC officer boarded the plane, the report said."", ""Meantime, officials at Nebraska’s public health laboratory, who had been working with Lawler, asked the CDC for permission to test passengers from the Diamond Princess while they were under quarantine, even if they didn’t have symptoms, emails show."", ""A CDC influenza expert, Dr. Tim Uyeki, wrote back on Feb. 17 to the director of the Nebraska Public Health Laboratory that the agency only wanted to test symptomatic individuals and those who had previously tested positive in Japan, citing a lack of detail on the accuracy of the Japanese tests."", 
""Uyeki declined to comment and referred questions to the CDC press office."", ""Lawler and Callahan said they flew in late February to CDC headquarters in Atlanta to meet with Redfield and other senior officials, to raise concerns about the flawed evacuation and potential for asymptomatic spread based on their observations from the Diamond Princess."", ""Lawler said CDC officials replied that there wasn’t enough proof yet that people without symptoms spread the disease."", ""Redfield did not return requests for comment."", 
""Meanwhile, at both quarantine sites in Texas and California, CDC staff began to test some cruise passengers without symptoms who previously had tested positive in Japan, according to Dr. Bela Matyas, the local health officer in California’s Solano County, as well as emails between the Nebraska hospital personnel and the CDC."", ""The CDC officials had doubts about the accuracy of testing done by Japanese authorities, but the results confirmed that at least some of the passengers were indeed positive - 16 at the California base alone, Matyas said. Texas numbers were not available."", 
""During the second week of quarantine in late February, the CDC and local health officials began offering tests to all of the cruise passengers. In California, where most sought testing, 10 more people were found to have COVID-19, Matyas said."", ""Despite this evidence of infections without symptoms, the CDC made no immediate changes in its public guidance on asymptomatic infection."", ""‘FAIRLY COMMON’"", ""By March, signs of asymptomatic spread were mounting in the United States and abroad."", ""A tipping point for the CDC came when staffers were deployed to the outskirts of Seattle to handle an outbreak at the Issaquah Nursing and Rehabilitation Center, a relatively confined setting. King County and CDC officials tested 76 of the 82 residents, regardless of whether they exhibited symptoms, beginning on March 13, according to the CDC."", 
""They found 23 infected, 13 asymptomatic at the time. Ten of those went on to develop symptoms."", ""“That was really ... our first hint that asymptomatic transmission was fairly common, especially in those settings,” said Dr. James Lewis, an official with the county health department’s COVID-19 response, in an interview."", ""Two weeks later, on March 27, the CDC published the case study as evidence of asymptomatic infection. That same week, for the first time, the agency recommended testing health workers and first responders, even without symptoms."", 
""In a radio interview that aired on March 31, Redfield said, “We have learned that in fact” symptomless individuals “do contribute to transmission.”"", ""Based on that evidence, the CDC recommended that even asymptomatic people wear cloth face coverings in public areas. Almost a month later, on April 27, the agency expanded its testing guidelines to include “persons without symptoms.”"", ""That was 11 weeks after Lawler’s first request to test the Wuhan group in Nebraska."

""Though some studies have suggested COVID-19 was present in Italy or Spain earlier in 2019, and that it might have been responsible for a spike in pneumonia cases in France, few researchers believe it could have entered Wuhan from Europe."", ""Its closest relative in nature is the RaTG13 virus, which was discovered in horseshoe bats in southwest China’s Yunnan province. The 96.2% genetic match between the two makes it highly likely that COVID-19 also originated in the bat colonies of China’s southwest border regions."", 
""The initial cluster of infections was traced back to the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, leading many to assume that “patient zero” was probably a trader exposed to contaminated meat products."", ""But this version of events may be too simplistic to explain the patterns of infection in Wuhan and elsewhere."", ""Many of the earliest reported cases had no connection with the market. On Dec. 10, 2019, 41 Wuhan residents were hospitalised with what turned out to be COVID-19, but 13 of them had no link to Huanan."", 
""A team of Chinese researchers said there were two types of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in Wuhan, only one of which was associated with the market."", ""Scientists also said the virus was unusually “pre-adapted” for rapid human transmission, making it unlikely that the first human contact was made at the seafood market."", ""WHO investigators are keen to find what the intermediary species was that allowed SARS-CoV-2 to move from its original bat host into humans."", ""Preliminary scientific papers in China identified snakes and mink as potential candidates, and similar coronavirus infections were also found in pangolins illegally trafficked into China."", 
""But some scholars now believe there was no intermediary species at all, and that a SARS-CoV-2 like virus was transmitted directly from bats to humans, possibly on multiple occasions."", ""The first people infected were likely to be traders in bat meat, or in bat droppings used in traditional Chinese medicine, and one of them could have carried it into the Huanan seafood market, causing the superspreader event that allowed the pandemic to begin."", ""“GAIN OF FUNCTION”"", ""Though there is no credible supporting evidence, some researchers still do not rule out the possibility that the virus was released accidentally by a specialist lab at the Wuhan Institute of Virology."", 
""There is no indication that SARS-Cov-2 contains any synthetic insertions, but some researchers say it could have been subject to a process known as “gain of function”, where the lab forces the virus to become more infectious by exposing it to human receptor cells."", ""Some experts say the WHO investigators needs to be granted access to all the research conducted in the lab to see whether there are any closer matches than the RaTG13 virus."", ""But there is another explanation why the coronavirus has proven to be so lethal."", 
""If SARS-CoV-2 had been circulating in humans throughout southwest China for months before it was finally identified in Wuhan, natural selection itself could have trained it to bind more effectively to those receptor cells."", ""Fully optimised after months of human exposure, it made an explosive breakthrough at the Huanan market, where conditions were ideal for rapid viral transmission - though it was also very likely spreading elsewhere."

The moderation is likely to persist at least through the first three months of 2021."", 
""The economy’s prospects hinge on the distribution of vaccines to fight the virus.

""“Without swift action, we risk a continued economic crisis that will make it harder for Americans to return to work and get back on their feet,” said Deese."", ""Gross domestic product decreased 3.5% in 2020, the biggest drop since 1946.

Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the economy, plunged 3.9%, the worst performance since 1932. The economy tumbled into recession last February."", 
""Delays by the government to offer another rescue package and renewed business disruptions caused by the virus restricted GDP growth to a 4.0% annualized rate in the fourth quarter. The big step-back from a historic 33.4% growth pace in the third quarter left GDP 2.5% below its level at the end of 2019."", ""The economy is expected to return to its pre-pandemic level in the second quarter of this year."", ""The Federal Reserve on Wednesday left its benchmark overnight interest rate near zero and pledged to continue pumping money into the economy through bond purchases, noting that “the pace of the recovery in economic activity and employment has moderated in recent months.”"", 
""With the virus still raging, economists are expecting growth to slow to below a 2.0% rate in the first quarter, before regaining speed by summer as the additional stimulus kicks in and more Americans get vaccinated."", ""“We foresee record-breaking consumer spending growth in 2021 with households benefiting from a watered-down $1.2 trillion version of Biden’s rescue plan, vaccine diffusion gradually reaching two thirds of Americans by July and employment accelerating this spring,” said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York."", 
""Stocks on Wall Street rallied as mega-cap technology shares tried to recoup recent losses. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies.

That has led to a so-called K-shaped recovery, where better-paid workers are doing well while lower-paid workers are losing out."", 
""The stars of the recovery have been the housing market and manufacturing as those who are still employed seek larger homes away from city centers, and buy electronics for home offices and schooling. A survey by professors at the University of Chicago and the University of Notre Dame showed poverty increased by 2.4 percentage points to 11.8% in the second half of 2020. The sharpest rise since the 1960s boosted the ranks of the poor by 8.1 million people."", ""Rising poverty was highlighted by persistent labor market weakness. In a separate report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits totaled a seasonally adjusted 847,000 for the week ended Jan. 23.

About 18.3 million Americans were receiving unemployment checks in early 2021."", ""“The labor market is struggling this winter, but better times are ahead,” said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody’s Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania."", 
""Lack of jobs and the temporary expiration of a government weekly jobless subsidy curtailed growth in consumer spending to a 2.5% rate in the fourth quarter after a record 41% pace in the July-September quarter."", ""But business investment grew at a 13.8% rate, with spending on equipment rising at a 24.9% pace. Spending on nonresidential structures rebounded after four straight quarterly declines."", ""Businesses also accumulated inventories last quarter, contributing to GDP growth. But the inventory build pulled in more imports, leading to a larger trade deficit, which subtracted from output. The housing market recorded another quarter of double-digit growth, thanks to historically low mortgage rates. Government spending was weak."""

""The British researchers behind the trial said data on vaccinating people with the two different types of vaccine could help understanding of whether shots can be rolled out with greater flexibility, and might even increase immunity."", ""Matthew Snape, an Oxford vaccinologist who is leading the trial, said mixing different shots had proven effective in Ebola vaccine schedules, and though the new trial mixed vaccine technologies, it could also work."", ""“Ultimately, it all comes down to the same target - cells making the spike protein - just using different platforms,” he told reporters."", 
""“For that reason we do anticipate that we’ll generate a good immune response with these combinations.”"", ""Public Health England’s head of immunisation, Mary Ramsay, said there was a lot of precedent for such work, as vaccines against Hepatitis A and B were interchangeable from two different manufacturers, and similar work has been undertaken for human papillomavirus (HPV)."

The virus could have been circulating in humans for a while before making its breakthrough in heavily populated Wuhan."", 
""The second scenario, seen as the most likely, involves transmission to humans via an as yet unknown intermediary species. Liang Wannian, an expert with China’s National Health Commission, said pangolins were potential candidates but other animals - including mink and even cats - may also be reservoirs."", ""A third possibility is that COVID-19 originated under the first or second scenarios and was then transmitted via cold chain products. Chinese experts have attributed later COVID-19 clusters to imported frozen food and have raised the possibility it might also have caused the Wuhan outbreak."", 
""The final scenario is that SARS-CoV-2 was leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which is known to have studied captive coronaviruses. Ben Embarek ruled out the possibility and said it would not be subject to further research. Accidents happen, he said, but it was “very unlikely” in this case."", ""The experts said that while it was unlikely there were large-scale outbreaks in Wuhan or elsewhere in China before December 2019, they do not rule out that it was circulating in other regions."", ""A crossover either directly from bats or from an intermediary species would suggest the transmission to Wuhan could have been facilitated by wildlife trading networks."", 
""Marion Koopmans, another member of the expert team, said wildlife on sale in the Huanan seafood market could be traced to regions that contain bat habitats known to harbour viruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2."", ""One such region is the southwestern Chinese province of Yunnan, but the team is also considering that the first human transmission took place across the border in Laos or Vietnam."", ""Although the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan was linked to the first case clusters, the initial crossover from animals to humans did not occur there."", 
""Liang said that there was still insufficient evidence to determine how the virus entered Huanan, but that it was clear it was circulating elsewhere in Wuhan at the same time."", ""The most likely scenario is that someone carried SARS-CoV-2 into the market, but Ben Embarek also suggested it could have been introduced via a “product”, including frozen wild animals known to be susceptible to the virus."", ""China has expressed concern that any investigation would be “politicised”, and said it would only cooperate if it was clear it would not be expected to take blame for the pandemic."", 
""By ruling out the lab leak and accepting that COVID-19 could have originated outside of China, the WHO team has not crossed any of Beijing’s lines. China would also be heartened that the WHO team is considering the cold-chain theory. But the findings are unlikely to satisfy those who believe China is culpable and has covered up evidence."", ""Ben Embarek said China needs now to find evidence that might prove the coronavirus was circulating much earlier than December 2019. He said blood bank samples would be a good place to start."", 
""Bat communities near Wuhan have been ruled out as a source, and more needs to be done to scour caves in other regions to see if a closer match to SARS-CoV-2 can be found."", ""The animals on sale at the Huanan market also need to be scrutinised further, and the role played by cold chain products in general also needs more research, Ben Embarek said."

At a large Israeli health maintenance organization where 650,000 members received the two-dose vaccine from Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE, researchers identified 2,897 patients who later tested positive for COVID-19. The amounts of virus on swab samples from the nose and throat were reduced four-fold for infections occurring at least 12 days after the first dose of vaccine compared to what is typically seen in unvaccinated COVID-19 patients, the research team from Maccabi Health Services and the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology found. Viral loads are known to be linked with contagiousness and disease severity. But this study was not a randomized trial and it did not look at patients' viral loads over time, nor the rates at which their contacts became infected, which would be the most direct evidence of whether a vaccine reduces virus transmission. Still, the authors concluded in a paper posted on Monday on the medical website medRxiv ahead of peer review, \""These reduced viral loads hint to lower infectiousness, further contributing to vaccine impact on virus spread.\"" (bit.ly/2LK5HnE)"", 
""Study shows range of COVID-19 benefits from arthritis drug"", ""A large study adds to evidence that Roche's arthritis drug tocilizumab, sold under the brand name Actemra, cuts the risk of death among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, shortens their hospital stays and reduces their need for mechanical ventilation. The randomized trial involved more than 4,000 patients with varying degrees of illness. Some needed only simple oxygen therapy while others needed mechanical ventilation. Most also were receiving a steroid such as dexamethasone. The rate of death within 28 days was 29% for patients in the tocilizumab group and 33% in the control group, according to a report posted on Thursday on the medical website medRxiv ahead of peer review. After accounting for patients' age, sex and other risk factors, tocilizumab was associated with a 14% reduction in the risk of death. \""We now know that the benefits of tocilizumab extend to all COVID patients with low oxygen levels and significant inflammation,\"" study co-leader Peter Horby of the University of Oxford said in a press statement. Used in combination with steroids, Horby added, \""the impact is substantial.\"" (bit.ly/3aUZhuy)"", 
""Bone marrow cells travel to brain in some COVID-19 patients"", ""Very large bone-marrow cells are showing up in the brains of people who died of COVID-19, which may help explain some of the neurological problems associated with the disease, according to researchers. The cells, called megakaryocytes, normally reside in the bone marrow and make platelets for blood clotting. “We found that in some patients who died of COVID-19, the capillaries - the smallest blood vessels - contained very large cells called megakaryocytes,” study leader David Nauen of Johns Hopkins University told Reuters. “They are so large they could be occluding blood flow through the capillaries and limiting oxygen delivery to the brain, which could impair brain function.” As reported on Friday in the journal JAMA Neurology, his team studied brain tissue from 15 patients who died of COVID-19 and found megakaryocytes in five of their brains. “What signaled these cells to leave the bone marrow and travel to the brain is unknown, but COVID-19 causes disruptions of the clotting system, and it’s possible this is related,” Nauen said."",

But in the last month, data from a vaccine trial in South Africa showed not only that a rapidly-spreading coronavirus variant could dampen the effect of the vaccine, it could also evade natural immunity in people who had been previously infected."", 
""“I couldn’t sleep” after seeing the data, Murray, director of the Seattle-based Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, told Reuters. “When will it end?” he asked himself, referring to the pandemic. He is currently updating his model to account for variants’ ability to escape natural immunity and expects to provide new projections as early as this week."", ""A new consensus is emerging among scientists, according to Reuters interviews with 18 specialists who closely track the pandemic or are working to curb its impact. Many described how the breakthrough late last year of two vaccines with around 95% efficacy against COVID-19 had initially sparked hope that the virus could be largely contained, similar to the way measles has been."", 
""But, they say, data in recent weeks on new variants from South Africa and Brazil has undercut that optimism. They now believe that SARS-CoV-2 will not only remain with us as an endemic virus, continuing to circulate in communities, but will likely cause a significant burden of illness and death for years to come."", ""As a result, the scientists said, people could expect to continue to take measures such as routine mask-wearing and avoiding crowded places during COVID-19 surges, especially for people at high risk."", 
""Even after vaccination, “I still would want to wear a mask if there was a variant out there,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, chief medical advisor to U.S. President Joe Biden, said in an interview. “All you need is one little flick of a variant (sparking) another surge, and there goes your prediction” about when life gets back to normal."", ""Some scientists, including Murray, acknowledge that the outlook could improve. The new vaccines, which have been developed at record speed, still appear to prevent hospitalizations and death even when new variants are the cause of infection. Many vaccine developers are working on booster shots and new inoculations that could preserve a high level of efficacy against the variants. And, scientists say there is still much to be learned about the immune system’s ability to combat the virus."", 
""Already, COVID-19 infection rates have declined in many countries since the start of 2021, with some dramatic reductions in severe illness and hospitalizations among the first groups of people to be vaccinated."", ""Murray said if the South African variant, or similar mutants, continue to spread rapidly, the number of COVID-19 cases resulting in hospitalization or death this coming winter could be four times higher than the flu. The rough estimate assumes a 65% effective vaccine given to half of a country’s population. In a worst-case scenario, that could represent as many as 200,000 U.S. deaths related to COVID-19 over the winter period, based on federal government estimates of annual flu fatalities."", 
""His institute’s current forecast, which runs to June 1, assumes there will be an additional 62,000 U.S. deaths and 690,000 global deaths from COVID-19 by that point. The model includes assumptions about vaccination rates as well as the transmissibility of the South African and Brazilian variants."", ""The shift in thinking among scientists has influenced more cautious government statements about when the pandemic will end. Britain last week said it expects a slow emergence from one of the world’s strictest lockdowns, despite having one of the fastest vaccination drives."", 
""U.S. government predictions of a return to a more normal lifestyle have been repeatedly pushed back, most recently from late summer to Christmas, and then to March 2022. Israel issues “Green Pass” immunity documents to people who have recovered from COVID-19 or been vaccinated, allowing them back into hotels or theaters. The documents are only valid for six months because it’s not clear how long immunity will last."", ""“What does it mean to be past the emergency phase of this pandemic?,” said Stefan Baral, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. While some experts have asked whether countries could completely eradicate any case of COVID-19 through vaccines and stringent lockdowns, Baral sees the goals as more modest, but still meaningful. “In my mind, it’s that hospitals aren’t full, the ICUs aren’t full, and people aren’t tragically passing,” he said."", 
""“SCIENTIFIC WHIPLASH”"", ""From the beginning, the new coronavirus has been a moving target."", ""Early in the pandemic, leading scientists warned that the virus could become endemic and “may never go away,” including Dr. Michael Ryan, head of the World Health Organization’s emergencies programme."", ""Yet they had much to learn, including whether it would be possible to develop a vaccine against the virus and how quickly it would mutate. Would it be more like measles, which can be kept almost entirely at bay in communities with high rates of inoculation, or flu, which infects millions globally each year?"", 
""For much of 2020, many scientists were surprised and reassured that the coronavirus had not changed significantly enough to become more transmissible, or deadly."", ""A major breakthrough came in November. Pfizer Inc and its German partner BioNTech SE as well as Moderna Inc said their vaccines were around 95% effective at preventing COVID-19 in clinical trials, an efficacy rate that is much higher than any flu shot."", ""At least a few of the scientists Reuters interviewed said even in the wake of those results, they hadn’t expected the vaccines to wipe out the virus. But many told Reuters that the data raised hope within the scientific community that it would be possible to virtually eliminate COVID-19, if only the world could be vaccinated quickly enough."", 
""“We all felt quite optimistic before Christmas with those first vaccines,” said Azra Ghani, chair in infectious disease epidemiology at Imperial College London. “We didn’t necessarily expect such high-efficacy vaccines to be possible in that first generation.”"", ""The optimism proved short-lived. In late December, the UK warned of a new, more transmissible variant that was quickly becoming the dominant form of the coronavirus in the country. Around the same time, researchers learned of the impact of the faster-spreading variants in South Africa and in Brazil."", 
""Phil Dormitzer, a top vaccine scientist at Pfizer, told Reuters in November that the U.S. drugmaker’s vaccine success signaled the virus was “vulnerable to immunization” in what he called “a breakthrough for humanity.” By early January, he acknowledged the variants heralded “a new chapter” in which companies will have to constantly monitor for mutations that could dampen the effect of vaccines."", ""In late January, the impact on vaccines became even clearer. Novavax’s clinical trial data showed its vaccine was 89% effective in a UK trial, but just 50% effective at preventing COVID-19 in South Africa. That was followed a week later by data showing the AstraZeneca PLC vaccine offered only limited protection from mild disease against the South African variant."", 
""The most recent change of heart was considerable, several of the scientists told Reuters. Shane Crotty, a virologist at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology in San Diego, described it as “scientific whiplash”: In December, he had believed it was plausible to achieve so-called “functional eradication” of the coronavirus, similar to measles."", ""Now, “getting as many people vaccinated as possible is still the same answer and the same path forward as it was on December 1 or January 1,” Crotty said, “but the expected outcome isn’t the same.”"""

Airline and travel stocks fell on Friday after Paris and much of northern France shut down for a month, days after Italy introduced stiff business and movement curbs for most of the country including Rome and Milan. The setbacks hit recovery prospects for the crucial peak season, whose profits typically tide airlines through winter, when most carriers lose money even in good times."", 
""“If there’s no confidence there, demand just doesn’t come back,” said Dublin-based Alton Aviation consultant Leah Ryan, who expects the bad news on vaccines and lockdowns to hurt already weak bookings."", ""The summer outlook also has been dented by rising infections in Greece and elsewhere, and a suspension of AstraZeneca’s vaccine by a number of European countries over health fears. Several countries announced resumption of use of the AstraZeneca shot this week after the European Medicines Agency said the benefits clearly outweigh its risks."", 
""Airlines that have already racked up billions in debt face further strain that some may not survive without fresh funds. British Airways owner IAG raised 1.2 billion euros ($1.43 billion) in a bond issue on Thursday, saying the cushion would protect it from a drawn-out slump."", ""A patchy stop-start summer may pose fewer difficulties for low-cost airlines such as Ryanair and Wizz Air, which can redeploy planes quickly between routes. But Ryanair’s home market expects to keep strict travel curbs in place at least throughout June, Irish health official Ronan Glynn said on Thursday, citing the “deteriorating situation internationally” and emerging more contagious virus variants."", 
""Ryanair shares traded 4.2% lower on Friday, with IAG down 4% and easyJet and Wizz both down 3.5%. Rebound hopes had driven travel stocks higher over the past month, led by IAG’s 25% gain."", ""While ultra-low cost carriers can take the pain of another summer washout, analysts say, rivals such as easyJet and Virgin Atlantic could face renewed balance-sheet pressures. Air France-KLM is also seeking to raise capital and reduce debt from last year’s 10.4 billion-euro bailout. The Franco-Dutch airline group aims to fly more than 50% of pre-crisis capacity this year, compared with 40%-50% for Lufthansa - targets that could still prove ambitious."", 
""“MAJOR HIT” “There’s a risk of an increased number of bankruptcies particularly between now and the end of the year,” Alexandre de Juniac, head of global airline body IATA, told Reuters."", ""The latest whiplash in recovery sentiment extends from airlines into hospitality industries and the broader economy, penalizing tourism-dependent Mediterranean countries. “Virus numbers are going up, the vaccine rollout is falling behind and there is a risk that Europe could lose a second summer,” Morgan Stanley economist Jacob Nell said, predicting a “major hit to the southern economies”."", 
""The weak European outlook contrasts with optimistic messages from U.S. airline CEOs, who this week reported rising spring and summer leisure bookings across the country, as the U.S. vaccination campaign gained momentum and coronavirus restrictions are eased."", ""United Airlines said it could halt its cash burn this month, excluding debt and severance payments."", ""Thanks to its faster progress on vaccinations, the UK outbound market has been seen as key to the coming European peak season. But rising European infection rates could threaten those plans too. Greece became Britain’s biggest source of imported cases when the countries opened a travel corridor last summer, according to an official UK study published this week. Instead, the faster pace of vaccinations in Britain and the United States could bring a transatlantic rebound – potentially flipping the conventional wisdom that short-haul will recover first. “These two countries are leading the G20,” with shots administered to 40% of the population in Britain and one-third in the United States, UBS aviation analyst Jarrod Castle said.”The North Atlantic could open up between (them) before other European markets, which would be greatly beneficial for British Airways.”"",

Researchers obtained blood samples from 99 individuals who had received one or two doses of either vaccine and tested their vaccine-induced antibodies against virus replicas engineered to mimic 10 globally circulating variants. Five of the 10 variants were \""highly resistant to neutralization,\"" even when volunteers had received both doses of the vaccines, the researchers reported on Friday in Cell. All five highly resistant variants had mutations in the spike on the virus surface - known as K417N/T, E484K, and N501Y - that characterize a variant rampant in South Africa and two variants spreading rapidly in Brazil. In keeping with previous studies, the proportion of neutralizing antibodies dropped 5- to 6-fold against the variants discovered in Brazil. Against the variant discovered in South Africa, neutralization fell 20- to 44-fold. A variant circulating now in New York has the E484K mutation. \""While studies of the New York variant are ongoing, our findings suggest that similar variants harboring E484K may be harder for vaccine-induced antibodies to neutralize,\"" said study leader Alejandro Balazs of Harvard University and the Massachusetts General Hospital. \""Despite our results,\"" he added, \""it's important to consider that vaccines raise other kinds of immune responses which could protect against developing severe disease.\"" (bit.ly/3bWB1Ko)"", 
""Variant identified in UK is deadlier"", ""The coronavirus variant first identified in the UK, known as B.1.1.7, is deadlier than other variants circulating there, a new study appears to confirm. Researchers analyzed data on 184,786 people in England diagnosed with COVID-19 between mid-November and mid-January, including 867 who died. For every three people who died within four weeks after being infected with another variant, roughly five died after becoming infected with B.1.1.7, according to a paper posted on medRxiv ahead of peer review. Overall, the risk of death with B.1.1.7 was 67% higher than the risk with other variants in England, the authors said. As with earlier variants, patients' risk of death increased with age, male gender, and pre-existing medical conditions. B.1.1.7 is now prevalent across Europe and predicted to become prevalent in the United States. \""Crucially,\"" the researchers wrote, \""emerging data suggest that the currently approved vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 are effective against the B.1.1.7.\"" (bit.ly/3r2vpCE)"", 
""Variant identified in Brazil is doubly infectious"", ""Between November and January in Manaus, Brazil, the frequency of COVID-19 cases involving the P.1 coronavirus variant increased from non-existent to 73%, and the number of infections there quadrupled compared to what the city experienced in the first wave of the pandemic, according to a report posted on medRxiv ahead of peer review. The greater infectiousness of the P.1 variant likely contributed to that, the report suggests. Based on national health surveillance data, the authors estimate that the P.1 variant is roughly 2.5 times more transmissible than previous variants circulating in Manaus. The spread of P.1 occurred despite the fact that 68% of the city's population had already been infected by the original strain of the coronavirus, the researchers noted. In their analysis, the risk of reinfection with P.1 was low. The ability of the variant to cause severe disease, or its pathogenicity, is still unclear. \""The P.1 variant has already been detected in at least 25 countries,\"" the authors said. \""This calls for urgent ... studies of the P.1 variant, since greater transmissibility and pathogenicity can drive even well-prepared health systems to collapse.\"" (bit.ly/38MGykw)"", 
""To avoid infection, new CPR technique adds distance"", ""To avoid coronavirus infection during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), medical professionals can increase their distance from the patient by doing chest compressions using the unshod heel of the foot - known as leg-heel compression - instead of their hands, a new study suggests. Researchers had 20 medical professionals perform standard manual chest compression followed by leg-heel chest compression after a brief instruction on a manikin. There was no difference in any of the variables measured, including correct placement of the heel for purposes of compression, correct depth of chest compression, and the compression rate. The study found potential spread of breath droplets from the patient to the person performing CPR would likely be minimized with leg-heel compression. \""Under special circumstances like COVID-19-pandemic, leg-heel chest compression may be an effective alternative ... compared to manual chest compression while markedly increasing the distance to the patient,\"" the researchers concluded in a paper posted on Monday on medRiv ahead of peer review.
