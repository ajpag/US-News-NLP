I am not alone in this and my goal is to help others while at the same time unshackle myself from this quiet hell I have been living in,\"" she wrote in the post."", 
""Despite a career typified by messages of body positivity and non-judgment, and a sensitive and fearless approach when it comes to tackling complex subjects, Lake clearly felt a great deal of fear around what people might think of her condition."", ""The fact that stress about how she might be perceived may have made her hair loss worse illustrates the damage done by stigma. The caveat with which she begins her message — \""I am not sick. (THANK GOD.) I am not having a mid-life crisis. nor am I having a mental breakdown, though I have been suffering\"" — anticipates the negative conclusions many might leap to upon seeing a middle-aged woman with a buzz cut."", 
""There is always a reaction when a famous woman shaves their head. Whether it's positive, negative or suspicious usually depends on other factors which have nothing to do with their hair. When a woman is young, thin and conventionally beautiful — see Cara Delevingne, Natalie Portman, Kristen Stewart or Zoe Kravitz — drastic haircuts are \""edgy\"" and intriguing and serve to \""accentuate\"" their delicate beauty. When a woman is young, thin, conventionally beautiful and coming of age — see Emma Watson post-Harry Potter, chopping hair short is emancipating."", 
""It is unheard of for a drastic change in a female celebrity's appearance to go unremarked. But if a woman doesn't seem 100% \""together\"" — think Britney Spears in 2007 — or isn't generally considered to be a fashion icon, then head shaving ceases to make automatic \""sense\"" to the world at large. It's important to note that this is not true of men, for whom the reactions to hair-shaving tend to be either: He's balding, he looks amazing or often not much at all. At the very least, it's unlikely he'd be under much pressure to explain himself."", 
""In Lake's case, the desire to meet society's demands upon women may have caused her stress and pain. As she describes in her post: \""After my last extreme diet where I lost 20 lbs. in 6 weeks, my hair started shedding again, big time.\"" Lake, who was 260 pounds before losing weight, told ABC News that it wasn't until she had slimmed down to a size 4 that she felt wanted on the covers of magazines."", """", ""Obesity is very common in America and hair loss is experienced by millions in the country but neither, it seems, is accepted by society in general, especially for women."", 
""When plus-size mannequins which reflected the bodies of most people far more truthfully than \""normal\"" ones were introduced in Nike stores last year, many responded with disgust. And though hair loss is not in and of itself dangerous, wildly successful and talented celebrities besides Ricki Lake have described their fear upon discovering their hair loss,  worries surely aggravated by the potential judgment of others."", ""Viola Davis described feeling \""desperate for people to think that [she] was beautiful,\"" Jada Pinkett-Smith  said it was \""terrifying\"" at first, and Selma Blair, whose hair started falling out after giving birth, has lamented that more people don't talk about it. That silence is damaging."", 
""Lake has set a brave example by talking about her hair loss and candidly revealing her fears. While it is a shame that she felt she needed to explain her decision to cut her hair — and incredibly likely that, had she not, it would have prompted speculation — one advantage of doing so on social media is that she is able to control the narrative."", ""Having spent years presenting a version of herself which, as she put it, caused \""deep pain and trauma,\"" she was finally able to be \""liberated.\"" Lake's fears illustrate how damaging stigmas of appearances can be, perhaps more than appearances themselves. Here's hoping her decision can spur others to choose the same form of freedom."",

Europe, China, big TV contracts, free agency, guys being able to pick and control where they go,\"" O'Neal said on TNT's \""Inside the NBA\"" following the news of Stern's hospitalization in December 2019."", ""Another big part of Stern's strategy was marketing the league's superstars and making them global icons. Magic Johnson and Larry Bird leading the charge in the '80s, then Jordan in the '90s and extending well into the 2000s with Kobe Bryant and LeBron James."",

""\""David Stern made probably a bigger impact on the game than any non-player in the history of the NBA,\"" Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr said in a video posted Wednesday. \""David Stern really led the expansion of the league.

The Vitamin Shoppe, which wants to sell you a ton of keto-based products, has named the first Sunday of this new decade \""National Keto Day.\"""",

Experts say it's because its legions of fans are focusing on the short-term benefits of fast weight loss, without factoring in possible long-term risks."", 
""What is keto?"", ""Keto is short for ketosis, a metabolic state that occurs when your liver begins to use stored fat to produce ketones for energy. The liver is programmed to do that when your body loses access to its preferred fuel -- carbohydrates -- and thinks it's starving."", ""The diet has actually been around since the 1920s, when a doctor stumbled on it as a way of controlling seizures in children with epilepsy who didn't respond to other treatment methods."", ""\""It was recognized long ago that denying the brain access to glucose, and converting to ketone-based metabolism, dampens brain electrical activity,\"" Katz said. \""But why on Earth would you want to dampen brain electrical activity unless you had refractory (unmanageable) epilepsy?\"""", 
""Creating ketosis is not as simple as it seems. Your liver is only forced into producing ketones when carb intake is drastically slashed. In the keto diet, you limit your intake of carbs to only 20 to 50 a day, the lower the better. To put that into perspective, a medium banana or apple is around 27 carbs, the full day's allowance."", ""It can take several days to weeks before your body fully transitions into burning fat. In the meantime, it will scream for carbs, and (speaking from personal experience) will punish you by sending a zombie to suck out your brains, a vampire to drain your blood and a giant troll to jump up and down on your body."", 
""The feeling of fatigue and malaise is so bad that keto-lovers have christened the experience \""keto-flu.\"""", ""You'll also have \""keto-breath,\"" a wonderfully metallic smell similar to nail polish remover emanating from your mouth. Other than urination, that's the only way ketones can escape your body."", ""Drinking water might help with dragon-breath. You'll also need to drink a lot of water to try to counter constipation and other gastric-grumblings due to the lack of fiber from fruits and starchy veggies."", 
""Once all that passes, keto-lovers maintain, you'll have more energy, a more focused brain, and best of all, very little hunger."", ""But those effects only last if you stay in ketosis. Cheat a bit, and your body scrambles to go back to what nature intended."", ""Therefore low-carb diets like keto rely heavily on fats to fill you up.  At least 70% of the keto diet will be made up of fat -- some say it's more like 90%. Of course you can get all that fat from healthy unsaturated fats such as avocados, tofu, almonds, walnuts, seeds and olive oil."", 
""But just in case you can't eat that many avocados, the diet also allows those not-so-good-for-your-arteries saturated fats like lard, butter, palm and coconut oils as well as whole-fat milk, cheese and mayonnaise."", ""And here's a twist: You can't rely too much on lean protein to accomplish ketosis. Eat more protein than an average 20% of your daily calories and your body will use that, and not fat, for fuel. Bye bye, ketosis."", ""Therefore protein sources for ketosis reply on \""skin-on poultry, fattier parts like chicken thighs, rib-eye steaks, grass-fed ground beef, fattier fish like salmon, beef brisket or pork shoulder,\"" according to U.S. News, as well as -- get ready America -- bacon!"", 
""Yessss. That's why this is a popular diet right? Like the dog in the 1980s commercial, we as a nation collectively jump up and down for bacon."", ""'Dirty' vs 'clean' eating"", ""Of course the lure of all-the-bacon-or-fat-you-can-eat was arguably behind the initial success of the Atkins diet that exploded into popularity in the '90s. It was followed by more low-carb options such as South Beach, Paelo, Whole30 and Zone, among others."", ""Yet critics say those initially popular plans have struggled to keep the public's interest as dieters have succeeded in losing some weight, only to fail to keep it off over the long term."", 
""Atkins has rebranded, offering different levels of carb restriction they call \""Atkins 20\"" and \""Atkins 40.\"" Colette Heimowitz, Atkins vice president for Nutrition Communication & Education, told CNN the company's approach allows for more flexibility than keto \""as we encourage people to incorporate foods back into their meals and find their carb tolerance level.\"""", ""Keto appears to be undergoing the same process, with some promoting \""clean\"" keto, which focuses on using all those avocados, nuts and seeds for fat sources, instead of \""dirty\"" keto, in which folks take the buns off their fast food burger and chow down."", 
""Clean keto advocates admit that it takes a good deal of effort to research food items and plan and prep meals, so \""unsurprisingly, many a keto eater takes the easy way out, eating a diet centered around foods like bacon, cheese, butter, and packaged foods,\"" according to an article on the Vitamin Shoppe's Keto HQ."", ""And that's the crux of the problem for nutritionists."", ""\""Most people who claim to eat 'Paleo' use that banner to justify eating any kind of meat they like, notably, bacon, burgers and pepperoni,\"" Katz said. \""There was no paleolithic pepperoni!"", 
""\""No doubt, the same is going on with keto -- people invoke the label to eat the foods they want to eat, notably processed meat,\"" he said. \""I suspect a very tiny minority of those attempting to eat keto are either eating clean or are in ketosis.\"""", ""What do the studies say"", ""Then there's the issue of varying health claims for keto and other low carb diets."", ""\""The ketogenic diet is designed to be a short-term diet, and there are a number of studies and trials demonstrating its effectiveness,\"" said chiropractor Josh Axe, a spokesperson for the Vitamin Shoppe, in statement."", 
""\""When done correctly, it can be a great tool used to treat and prevent several chronic conditions while also supporting overall health,\"" said Axe, who is the author of \""The Keto Diet: Your 30-day Plan to Lose Weight, Balance Hormones and Reverse Disease.\"""", ""An Atkins spokesperson pointed to a two-year study by a health group selling ketosis diet interventions and told CNN in a statement that \""today's science\"" shows \""people can improve health markers pertaining to weight loss, cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome\"" when they control carbs."", 
""Not exactly accurate, according to Gardner and Katz."", ""\""There's very little research, and to the best of my knowledge, all of it is linked to a company marketing the keto diet,\"" Katz said."", ""\""The bottom line is that despite its current popularity, we have very few studies that can support or refute its impact on health,\"" Gardner said."", ""The National Lipid Association Nutrition and Lifestyle Task Force reviewed all the available evidence in 2019 and found low and very-low carb diets \""are not superior to other dietary approaches for weight loss,\"" and in some cases even raised cholesterol levels."", 
""In addition, they found \""three separate observational studies, including a large prospective cohort study with long-term follow-up,\"" showed an association between very low-carb diets and \""all-cause mortality.\"""", ""So far, at least, it appears science has found the benefits of low-carb diets are fleeting."", ""\""What the early studies have shown is that there are early benefits in terms of weight loss and glucose control,\"" Gardner said. \""But in the few studies that have gone on for 12 months, the benefit in comparison to other diet approaches diminishes and is no longer statistically significant.\"""", 
""Which is why nutritionists fail to see the benefit of subjecting your body to the stresses of a low-carb diet just to lose a bit of weight, gain it back, and then start all over again."", ""\""To achieve and maintain a healthy body weight, or optimize diabetes or heart disease risk factors, we should not be focusing on a 'diet', \"" said Alice Lichtenstein, director and senior scientist at Tuft's University's Cardiovascular Nutrition Laboratory."", ""\""We should be focusing on dietary patterns, making changes in current practices that can be sustained lifelong.\"""""

""\""That's really important and reflects improvements in the treatment of lung cancer across the continuum from improvements in staging to advances in surgical techniques, improvements in radiotherapy, all of these things coming together,\"" she said. \""We were very encouraged to see that not only is the decline continuing for cancer mortality but we saw the biggest single-year drop ever from 2016 to 2017.\"""", ""Reductions in smoking, improvements in treatment"", ""The report included data on cancer incidence, mortality and survival in the United States from sources including the National Center for Health Statistics, National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program, the National Program of Cancer Registries and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries. Some of the information dates back to 1930 and the most recent data is from 2017. Using that data, the report also projects estimated numbers of new cases and deaths that could emerge in the United States in 2020."", 
"""", ""An analysis of the data showed that, since its peak of about 215 cancer deaths for every 100,000 people in 1991, the cancer death rate in the United States has continued to fall."", ""The report found an overall drop of 29% as of 2017, which translates into an estimated 2.9 million fewer cancer deaths than what would have occurred if death rates had remained at their peak, according to the report."", ""\""We've had this continuous decline in the cancer death rate for the past 26 years,\"" Siegel said."", 
""\""The biggest driver is the reductions in smoking, but also contributing are improvements in treatment as well as early detection for some cancers, like breast and colorectal cancer,\"" she said. \""It was exciting that we're seeing that decline continue because for other leading causes of death like heart disease and cerebrovascular disease progress is really slowing and in fact death rates have stabilized for cerebrovascular disease,\"" or stroke."", ""Heart disease remains the leading cause of death in the United States, and cancer ranks as the second leading cause of death in the United States."",

The death rate for prostate cancer fell by 52% since 1993, the death rate for colorectal cancer among men fell by 53% since 1980 and the death rate for colorectal cancer among women fell by 57% since 1969."",

"""", ""The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends yearly lung cancer screening for current or former smokers with a smoking history of 30 or more pack-years, which is equivalent to, for example, smoking one pack a day for 30 years or two packs a day for 15 years. Those recommendations are for adults, ages 55 to 80, who either currently smoke or quit within the past 15 years."", ""\""Screening for lung cancer among patients who are current or former smokers has been demonstrated in now numerous studies to reduce lung cancer mortality, but of the patients who meet all the eligibility criteria for screening, less than 5% of patients in the US actually get screened for lung cancer appropriately. So that's a huge shortfall of where we need to be,\"" Awad said."", 
""\""I think we've made really important headway and progress,\"" he said. \""But certainly there's a long way to go.\"""", """", ""The new report highlights both the significant progress made in reducing cancer deaths and the areas where some more work needs to be done, said Dr. Charles Fuchs, director of the Yale Cancer Center in New Haven, Connecticut, who was not involved in the report."", ""While improvements in cancer treatments, such as immunotherapies, have played a role in reducing cancer deaths in the United States, Fuchs said there is still much to learn about how to advance new and emerging treatment options even further. Immunotherapy is a type of cancer treatment that helps the immune system fight the disease."", 
""\""Those treatments work for some cancers, but not all. So I think we have to better understand how can we further leverage that success to understand how to activate the immune system to attack the other major cancers,\"" Fuchs said."", ""He also said that improvements could be made in reducing racial and socioeconomic disparities, increasing cancer screening rates, such as for colon cancer, and reducing the prevalence of certain risk factors for cancer, such as overweight and obesity. It has been estimated that about 20% of all cancers are tied to excess weight."", 
"""", ""\""The bottom line is that this report is great news,\"" Fuchs said."", ""\""I don't want to overlook that fact, nor do I want to minimize that fact,\"" he said. \""This report demonstrates extraordinary progress in our battle against cancer in terms of detection, improving treatment, improving mortality, improving screening technologies -- and given that tremendous success, I'm excited about the opportunity to work toward even more improvements.\"""

In the next 200 years, all our glaciers are expected to follow the same path. This monument is to acknowledge that we know what is happening and know what needs to be done.

""For example, when pneumonia sets in, the immune system sends white blood cells to the lungs to help.

""\""It's so deceptive. She's vibrant and young and healthy, and she gives the appearance of being much more well than she actually is,\"" he said."", ""The best way to prevent complications of the flu is to get your child a flu shot.

But from the viewpoint of her inner animal brain, who wants to pucker up to a mouth fringed by a thicket of hair that might contain tiny, squirmy, maggot-like creatures?"",

Women ranked faces with heavy stubble most attractive; light stubble, heavy beards and clean-shaven faces were judged less attractive."", 
""In this new study, published Tuesday in the Royal Society Open Science journal, very masculine faces and those with beards were rated more attractive than feminine-looking male faces or clean-shaven faces. This held true regardless if the woman was looking for a short-term or long-term relationships."", ""In fact, men with masculine features such as a wide jaw and strong brow who had beards were the most attractive for both types of relationships."", ""But when our innate disgust toward parasitic creatures was factored into the equation, things changed. The study found women who expressed higher levels of disgust toward parasites and other pathogens were more likely to judge a man's beard as unattractive."", 
""In evolutionary theory, this could make sense. It's thought humans evolved to have less hair on our bodies partly because it lessened the risk of disease-carrying parasites to proliferate."", ""Today, surveys show hairless chests are preferred among women from the USA, China, New Zealand, Finland, Brazil, Slovakia, Czechoslovakia and Turkey (but not among women from the UK and Cameroon)."", ""Still, research in the area is confusing: Studies have shown that if a woman grew up with a bearded father they are more likely to find beards attractive; women who are in current relationships with men with facial hair also tend to like it more."", 
""While science sorts it out, guys, you might as well play it safe. If you're considering growing a beard and your partner finds ticks, fleas, lice and other hair-dwelling creatures nauseating, your stubble could get you into trouble."

Today, chains like Sheetz, Wawa and Kwik Trip offer meal kits, salads, keto snacks, Kombucha and espressos."", ""That overhaul is driving convenience stores' rise, unexpected survivors in an industry suffering mass store closings and shoppers shifting online. While delivery from Amazon (AMZN) has redefined what convenience means for many Americans, the 24-hour, 3,230-average-square-foot convenience store still fills a niche for time-strapped customers searching for a bite to eat and a fill up at the pump."", 
""\""It has absolutely been a hidden gem,\"" said Jeff Williams, senior vice president of retail services at Nielsen. \""They are demanding that consumers view them as a destination for food.\"""", ""Convenience stores have reinvented their businesses to adjust to the changing ways Americans eat. Snacking is becoming consumers' preferred meal of choice, and Americans are cooking fewer of their dinners at home as they eat out or order in from their couch."", """", ""To keep up, chains are hiring executives from restaurants and expanding their snack choices and prepared food in kitchens on site."", 
""Consumers, especially Millennials, are not always willing to go to a quick-service restaurant, a fast-food joint or walk around a 40,000-square-foot grocery store, analysts say. Instead, they'll often head to a convenience store, where the average amount of time customers spend inside the store is less than four minutes."", ""\""People simply don't have the time to sit down a whole meal at night like they used to,\"" said Carl Rick, leadership development specialist at Kwik Trip, which is building around 40 stores a year and just opened its 700th. \""The more places there are where people can duck in, be out in three minutes with milk, eggs, maybe a sandwich, something to drink—those places are doing very well.\"""",

Close to 80% of convenience stores have a gas station attached."", 
""For years, convenience chains relied on tobacco, soft drinks and fuel to draw in customers, a business model often known as \""Cokes, smokes and gas.\"" But Americans today are smoking less and steadily cutting out soda."", """", ""And increased regulations on tobacco and the decline of sugary drinks will continue to chip away at the areas convenience stores have long relied on to grow.

At a 7-Eleven lab store in Dallas, it has a growler bar stocked with local craft beers and a bar with frozen yogurt and ice cream. There is also a patio and inside dining areas."", 
""The chain recently debuted Voyager Point, its own line of wine priced under $12."", ""Competition bearing down"", ""But convenience stores are not the only areas of retail that recognize shifting consumer habits and demand for small-size stores."", ""Retailers and grocery stores have introduced copycat convenience-type models with food, and restaurants have sharpened their focus on breakfast and snacks.

These areas are \""further growth opportunities\"" for McDonald's."", 
""Meanwhile, online competitors threaten to disrupt traditional convenience stores."", ""Amazon reportedly has its eye on opening up to 3,000 small, cashier-less Go stores by 2021.

GoPuff, a \""convenience store delivery app\"" that has expanded rapidly in dozens of cities, offers $1.95 delivery on more than 2,000 items from its own fulfillment centers."", ""But some convenience store executives say they are unfazed by Amazon and online entrants."", 
""More than half of Casey's stores are in towns with fewer than 5,000 people. And CEO Darren Rebelez believes Amazon will have a difficult time reaching those rural customers."", ""\""I don't think that [Amazon Go] is something that's likely to show up in our footprint anytime soon,\"" he said. \""It's tough to really disrupt this industry in a meaningful way.\"""

""The suit, filed Wednesday, alleges that Epstein used a system of private planes, helicopters, boats and vehicles to bring young women and girls to his island residence on Little St. James.

""Epstein registered as a sex offender in the Virgin Islands in 2010, and so the Virgin Islands government attempted to visit him to conduct additional address verifications.

""The link was particularly strong in men, researchers said."", ""\""Abdominal obesity not only increases your risk for a first heart attack or stroke, but also the risk for recurrent events after the first misfortune,\"" said Dr. Hanieh Mohammadi of the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, in a news release."", ""\""Maintaining a healthy waist circumference is important for preventing future heart attacks and strokes regardless of how many drugs you may be taking or how healthy your blood tests are.\"""", ""The study tracked more than 22,000 Swedish patients after their first heart attack and looked at the link between their waist circumference and events caused by clogged arteries like fatal and non-fatal heart attacks and stroke. Patients were followed for nearly four years, with 1,232 men (7.3%) and 469 women (7.9%) experiencing a heart attack or stroke."", 
""Most patients — 78% of men and 90% of women — had abdominal obesity, defined as a waist circumference of 94 cm (37.6 inches) or above for men, and 80 cm (32 inches) or above for women."", ""The study found that belly fat was associated with heart attacks and stroke independent of other risk factors like smoking, diabetes, hypertension, body mass index and prevention treatments. The researchers stressed that waist circumference was a more important marker than overall obesity and advised doctors to measure their patient's waists to identify those at risk."", 
""However, they said that the link was stronger and more linear in men, who made up nearly three-fourths of the patients included in the study, than women."", ""In women, Mohammadi said the relationship was \""U-shaped\"" rather than linear, meaning that the mid-range waist measurement, rather than the narrowest, was least risky. What's more, the mid-range waist measurement was in the range traditionally recognized as at risk for abdominal obesity: more than 80 cm wide."", ""The reason for this could be down to the type of fat that tends to hang out on men's and women's bellies. Mohammadi said some studies have suggested that men may have more visceral fat that goes deep inside your body and wraps around your vital organs."", 
""This fat can be turned into cholesterol that can start collecting along and hardening your arteries, perhaps ultimately leading to a heart attack or stroke."", ""\""In women it is thought that a greater portion of the abdominal fat is constituted by subcutaneous fat which is relatively harmless,\"" she said."", ""However, the lower numbers of women included in the study meant the findings had less \""statistical power\"" and more research was needed to draw definite conclusions, Mohammadi said."", ""The risk of cardiovascular disease like heart attacks or strokes is considered to be higher in those with a waist measurement of above 94 cm in men and above 80 cm in women, according to the World Health Organization. The risk is thought to be substantially increased in men with a waist wider than 102 cm and 88 cm in women."", 
""The authors said that belly fat was best tackled by a healthy diet and regular exercise. Earlier studies have shown that regular moderate cardio, like walking for at least 30 minutes a day, can help fight a widening waistline. Strength training with weights may also help but spot exercises like sit-ups that can tighten abs won't touch visceral fat."

Iran retaliated with a strike of its own, firing more than a dozen ballistic missiles at Iraqi military bases housing US troops."",

""Experts say climate change has worsened the scope and impact of natural disasters like fires and floods. Australia has seen that impact firsthand, with wildfires ravaging the country for months."", ""So what can we do to set the Clock back?"", ""The threats of nuclear destruction and global warming might seem too big for us to handle, but the Bulletin's goal is not to use the Clock as a scare tactic, but to get people talking."", ""\""What we try to do is give the public the ability to talk about the state of nuclear security and to really pressure their leaders to pay attention to that and climate change and show that they're concerned about it,\"" Bronson said."",

Looking at data from 2014 to 2016, new research found this class of central nervous system depressants was prescribed at about 65.9 million office-based doctor visits. That's a rate of 27 annual visits per 100 adults."", ""The research, which analyzed data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, was published on Friday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."", ""Benzodiazepines such as alprazolam, diazepam and lorazepam can be helpful when taken on a short-term basis. Doctors often prescribe them to relieve acute anxiety, agitation or to help someone sleep. Taken over the long term, they can become addictive. In older adults, the drugs have been shown to increase the risk of falls, cloud judgment and impair memory. There is an increased risk of hospitalization and death for people who take benzos, particularly if they are taken with an opioid."", 
""Despite the risks, among the doctor visits at which benzodiazepines were prescribed, approximately one-third involved an overlapping opioid prescription at a rate of 10 annual visits per 100 adults from 2014 to 2016. That prescription combination increased from 0.5% of doctor visits in 2003 to 2% in 2015."", ""Women sought these prescriptions more than men and the number of visits increased with age. Nearly half of benzo prescription visits were to a primary care provider. Past studies have shown a growing number of primary care doctors have written these prescriptions."", 
""In the new study, the data showed that a chronic condition was the most common reason that someone went to the doctor for this prescription. A mental disorder was the most frequent primary diagnosis category. Musculoskeletal system and connective tissue issues were the most frequent diagnosis if the patient also got a prescription for opioids at that doctor visit."", ""What stood out to Dr. Joanna Starrels was the number of elderly patients who were prescribed these drugs."", ""\""The most alarming finding in this study are the numbers about the elderly, this is the population that face the most danger from the drugs,\"" said Starrels, an associate professor in the department of medicine at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. She didn't work on this research, but has studied these drugs. \""The elderly face an elevated risk of falls, confusion, cognitive impairment, in addition to overdose. These risks increase even more when elderly patients are co-prescribed benzodiazepines with opioids. This is the reason why societies like the American Geriatrics Society caution against them.\"""", 
"""", ""There have been an increasing number of deaths related to benzodiazepine overdoses, studies have shown. Some analysts believe that while the over-prescription of opioids has gotten a lot of attention, the prescription of benzos has been overlooked and needs more attention, and more needs to be done to raise awareness among doctors about the potential problems associated with prescribing these drugs."", ""Keith Humphreys, a psychologist and Esther Ting Memorial Professor at Stanford University, has studied the over-prescription of benzos. He called them \""the \""Rodney Dangerfield\"" of drugs -- that don't get the attention they deserve."", 
""\""Maybe it's because a lot of people who are addicted to benzodiazepines are older, fewer are violent and it's not an addiction that will get noticed as much as people who are addicted to alcohol or meth or heroin, that have all kinds of impacts on people around them, or maybe people think that since they come from a doctor they can't be all that bad,\"" said Humphreys, who is not affiliated with the new study."", ""But they can be harmful, even if doctors don't know as much about them, Humphreys said. About 30% of what is labeled opioid overdose is actually opioid-benzodiazepine overdose, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse statistics."", 
""Humphreys, who also works at the Veterans Health Administration, said the system the agency uses helps prevent over-prescriptions of the drugs."", """", ""If a Florida patient trips and falls in California, for example, a VA doctor can check the system to see if the patient is already getting a prescription for opioids, and if they are, they won't also prescribe them benzodiazepines, Humphreys said. He said doctors outside the VA may not realize that another physician has put a patient on a benzo or an opioid."", 
""\""They could be prescribing these in good faith and don't realize the overlapping prescriptions,\"" Humphreys said."", ""He said he hopes studies, like this latest one, will continue to raise awareness among doctors so they can be equally as careful about prescribing benzos as they are starting to be with opioids."", ""\""This is a really undercovered story,\"" Humphreys said. \""I think of it as the hidden element of our overdose epidemic that does need attention.\"""

It is Walmart's first meatpacking plant. Costco has also developed its own farm-to-store poultry production operation in Nebraska to control some of its chicken production."", 
""Although Walmart's plant is a step toward a farm-to-shelf meat production, Walmart doesn't actually operate the facility, nor does it own any cows or butcher the meat. An outside processor will operate the plant in Thomasville, Georgia, 20 miles from the Florida border and a little bigger than the size of a Walmart supercenter."", """", ""The plant's opening is the latest move in top US retailers' attempts to muscle into the food supply chain, an area traditionally dominated by food processors. Four companies control around 85% of the US cattle market, according to the Department of Agriculture. Walmart (WMT) buys its beef from Tyson (TSN) and Cargill, and it's Tyson's largest customer."",

""\""I never thought it would be as controversial as it turned out, although I remember saying when we were writing it that some religious nut case may take potshots at us,\"" Jones told the Radio Times magazine in 2011. \""At the time, religion seemed to be on the back burner and it felt like kicking a dead donkey.

In the past it has led to political, financial and social consequences."", ""The shutdown of Wuhan, a city of more than 11 million people where the virus originated, is \""utterly incredible,\"" Howard Markel, professor and director of the Center for the History of Medicine at the University of Michigan, told CNN."", 
""\""I've never seen an entire city 11.4 million people cordoned off like that,\"" Markel said. \""I thought I'd seen everything.\"""", ""Lawrence Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University and director of the World Health Organization's Center on Global Health Law, said the move was \""unprecedented,\"" and, he thought, \""very unwise.\"""", ""\""Nothing on this scale has ever been tried,\"" he told CNN. \""There's very little evidence of its effectiveness. And I think there's good reason to think that it could backfire, from a public health, social, human rights perspective.\"""", 
""No quarantine goes perfectly"", ""Quarantines date back to Italy in the 1300s, as the bubonic plague ravaged Europe. In Venice, sailors and ships coming from infected ports were made to wait 40 days before docking in a practice called \""quaranta giorni,\"" or \""40 days.\"""", ""People criticize quarantines because in practice a virus or bacteria \""invariably gets loose,\"" Markel said, as do people. \""Every quarantine, people get out,\"" he said. \""They just do, especially one of this magnitude.\"""", ""Large-scale quarantines like the one in Wuhan are generally avoided nowadays, with the medical community more focused on providing treatment, medication and vaccines to prevent them entirely, according to Markel."", 
""Quarantines \""can stay things or quell things for a while,\"" he said, \""but they're not the best things to use long-term.\"""", ""They can also lead to logistical issues. Just the word \""quarantine\"" can cause panic or hysteria, Markel said. Anyone concerned about a common cold or sniffle will head for hospitals, straining already precious resources. Wuhan officials have already acknowledged local hospitals were struggling to accommodate people seeking medical attention."", ""There are also human rights implications when Wuhan and more than a dozen other Chinese cities are placed under lockdown, Gostin said. \""I don't think you can enforce a mass quarantine of 30 million people without violating human rights.\"""", 
""Gostin also questioned the effectiveness of the approach, pointing to smaller quarantines during the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa. \""It spurred public violence, there was ... distrust of public health authorities, people didn't come in for treatment and it was thought that it actually set back the outbreak response considerably,\"" he said."", ""There are broader financial and social consequences"", ""But outside the realm of public health, quarantines can present broader societal problems. Perhaps most obvious is the economic impact."", 
""Quarantines \""are often very economically and financially costly,\"" said Alexandre White, an assistant professor of sociology and the history of medicine at Johns Hopkins University."", ""The flow of trade in and out of the quarantined zone is halted, and goods in the process of being shipped could go bad -- depending on how long it lasts."", ""\""As any quarantine extends, the economic and social hardships on the community under quarantine will expand, requiring the delivery of food and services and also hindering local economic activity,\"" he said."", 
""These economic impacts are a large part of why quarantines are seen as a \""less desirable course of action,\"" White said."", ""Then there are the social consequences, White said, particularly for marginalized members of a community. Historically, he said, the aggressive control needed in a quarantine can link the disease to marginalized people and potentially fuel existing anxieties about race and class."", ""White pointed to an outbreak of bubonic plague in Cape Town in 1901 that led to a racially segregated quarantine camp, which he said was later used as a blueprint for racial segregation during apartheid."", 
""Markel told CNN there was a \""long history of quarantine being misused as a social separator, rather than a public health one.\"""", ""\""There's a risk of stigmatization,\"" he said, \""that marginalized groups are rightly concerned about and fear.\"""", ""Trust and cooperation are key"", ""There's still a lot that's unknown about the coronavirus outbreak and how Chinese officials are responding to it."", ""But generally, the trust and cooperation of the public is the most important thing for officials to have in a public health crisis, said Gostin."", 
""Without it, people won't come in for testing and won't share the names of people they've been in contact with -- a vital part of the strategy to prevent the spread of disease."", ""\""People get fearful, they hunker down ... You can't go to social clubs, you can't see friends. A lockdown of 30 million people -- that really upends their lives.\"""", ""Gostin believes the best way to tackle a situation like the one in Wuhan is a \""surge of the public health response,\"" he said. It should be easier for people to get to hospital and there should be mobile clinics that meet people at their homes to provide testing and treatment."", 
""Governments implementing a quarantine should still want the public's cooperation, said Markel. The government should provide plenty of explanation and keep up constant communication"", ""\""Getting the buy-in from the people you're protecting is essential,\"" he said, \""and always better than ordering people to do stuff.\"""

What happens next is vital for many businesses, yet the outlook isn't great."", ""The United Kingdom is entering an 11-month transition period during which Prime Minister Boris Johnson must race to strike new trade deals with his country's biggest economic partners. Failure would mean even more pain for an economy that's already ground to a halt."", 
"""", ""After four decades as a member of a powerful trading bloc, Britain is striking out on its own. The first task is to decide how close a relationship it wants with the European Union, which currently buys almost half of UK exports. Johnson is intent on diverging from the bloc on key regulatory issues, saying he wants room to negotiate new trade deals with other powers, such as the United States."", ""Yet the more Britain diverges from the European Union, the harder it will be to trade with neighbors including France and Germany. Many British companies, having already been battered by uncertainty over Brexit, can scarcely afford new trade barriers that threaten to snarl supply chains and make their products and services more expensive."", 
""Other things stand in the way of securing trade deals with Europe or the United States. The UK negotiating team is inexperienced, and it will be working to a very tight timetable."", ""\""We have not done trade negotiations for 40 years,\"" Kim Darroch, the former UK ambassador to the United States, told The Guardian on Friday. Britain has not yet published its negotiating objectives with the United States, he said, \""frankly because we haven't had the bandwidth to work it out.\"""", ""What happens next"", 
""While Britain severs its legal bonds with the European Union on Friday, the trading relationship won't change during the transition period that runs through the end of 2020. Johnson could ask to extend this deadline, but he has repeatedly promised not to do so."", ""Miscalculation would be costly. If the United Kingdom has not agreed a new trade agreement with Brussels when the clock expires, it will face significant new trade barriers. This is the \""hard Brexit\"" that has long terrified the business community, and prompted the CEOs of companies like Airbus (EADSF) and Nissan (NSANF) to warn of dire consequences."", 
""American companies, which have invested more than $750 billion in the United Kingdom and employ more than 1.5 million Britons, are also worried."", ""\""We urge the UK and EU to move quickly so that US investors and exporters have the necessary clarity to grow their businesses and create even more jobs,\"" Marjorie Chorlins, executive director of the US-UK Business Council said in a statement. \""It is essential that the transition period continue until a final UK-EU agreement is concluded,\"" she added."", 
""The threat of new tariffs on goods trade with Europe, where there were none before, should force London to prioritize negotiations with Brussels. UK finance minister Sajid Javid, speaking in Davos last week, confirmed that a trade deal with Europe would come before the United States."", ""\""Rather than charging headlong into a trade agreement with the United States, Britain's priorities should be stabilizing relationships with existing trade partners and regaining their trust,\"" Sam Lowe, a senior research fellow at the Centre for European Reform, wrote recently."", 
"""", ""Even then, comprehensive trade agreements are typically negotiated over the course of many years, not months, and experts say the best the United Kingdom can hope for this year is a deal with Europe that keeps tariffs at bay but leads to new administrative and regulatory barriers on exports of goods and services."", ""Analysts at Deutsche Bank say the type of bare bones deal that is possible to reach in 2020 would mean friction at the border and reduced access to Europe for the huge UK services industry. Britain's mighty financial services sector, which accounts for 7% of economic output, will almost certainly see its access to EU markets restricted."", 
""And even this kind of limited deal will require the government to make politically difficult choices such as whether Britain should restrict access to its territorial waters for EU fishing fleets."", ""\""Is the United Kingdom prepared to make the domestic compromises necessary to seal an agreement?\"" Lowe asked. \""So far the government has struggled to produce answers.\"""", ""A deal with the United States?"", ""A deal with the United States may be even harder for Johnson to deliver quickly."", ""America, which already has a trade surplus with the United Kingdom, is not about to grant a deal that showers money on the United Kingdom without asking for a lot in return. And US demands are anathema to big chunks of the UK population, because they could mean more expensive medicines or lower food standards."", 
""The United States will push hard to open the UK market to more agricultural exports, including chicken that is washed with chlorine and beef that is treated with hormones. It will also demand rule changes that would increase the price Britain pays for pharmaceutical drugs."", """", ""Johnson has done little to prepare the UK public for this reality."", ""\""The United Kingdom will not get an easy ride just because of its so-called special relationship with the United States,\"" said Lowe. \""If the United Kingdom resists US demands, particularly in the area of agriculture and food hygiene, then concluding a comprehensive [free trade agreement] could take years.\"""", 
""US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said during a trip to London this week that substantial progress was possible before the end of the year. But he told radio station LBC that \""there will be real contentious issues around agriculture\"" when asked whether the United States would seek to force chlorinated chicken upon the United Kingdom."", ""\""We need to make sure that we don't use food safety as a ruse to try and protect a particular industry,\"" said Pompeo. \""Consumers ... are going to be the net beneficiaries of these really good deals.\"""", 
""Additionally, the US Congress, which must approve comprehensive free trade deals, is unlikely to hand President Donald Trump a win on trade ahead of the presidential election in November. And Britain has already gone against the US administration twice recently on key issues. It allowed Huawei to help build telecoms networks in the United Kingdom and pledged to move ahead with a new tax that would hit US tech companies."", """", ""The Trump administration responded to the latter by threatening to impose tariffs on cars made in Britain, in a sign of how little the special relationship means when it comes to trade. Navigating these unpredictable waters will require a deft touch."", 
""\""President Donald Trump is unpredictable and quick to take offense, and treats trade as akin to a protection racket — first he increases the threat, in the form of tariffs and instability, and then offers to shield you in exchange for payment,\"" said Lowe."", ""What failure looks like"", ""The state of the British car industry shows why striking sensible deals quickly is so important."", ""UK car production fell 14% last year, according to data released this week by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. The sector's third consecutive annual decline was spurred by trouble in key overseas markets, and a shift away from diesel cars in Europe, but uncertainty over Brexit also played a huge role."", 
""\""The fall of UK car manufacturing to its lowest level in almost a decade is of grave concern. Every country in the world wants a successful automotive sector as it is a driver of trade, productivity and jobs,\"" Mike Hawes, CEO of the SMMT, said in a statement."", ""The global automakers who have built factories in Britain fear the year could end without Britain having agreed a new trade deal with the European Union. That would snarl their supply chains, disrupt production and erode profit margins that are already razor thin."", 
""Over time, many would seek to shift production out of the United Kingdom. Some could abandon the country entirely."", ""\""It is essential we reestablish our global competitiveness and that starts with an ambitious free trade agreement with Europe, one that guarantees all automotive products can be bought and sold without tariffs or additional burdens,\"" said Hawes."

Now the coronavirus outbreak threatens to derail things once again."", ""Officials on Monday said Hong Kong's economy shrank 1.2% last year as massive pro-democracy protests paralyzed the city's streets and scared away tourists. GDP shrank 2.9% in the fourth quarter alone. The trade spat between Washington and Beijing compounded the problem, as did concerns about China's economic growth."", 
""Until recently, the Asian financial hub had reason to hope that 2020 would be better. The demonstrations were becoming less frequent, while an initial trade deal provided some hope that the relationship between the United States and China could improve."", ""\""The US-China phase one trade deal and growth stabilization in China should have been positive for Hong Kong's near-term economic outlook,\"" said Tommy Wu, a senior economist at Oxford Economics. \""But it has been overshadowed by the coronavirus outbreak.\"""",

Retail stores, theme parks, cultural attractions and other hotspots also remain closed. Crowds are still common, but most people are wearing face masks as a form of protection."", ""The coronavirus \""will definitely cause a double blow to the economy,\"" Hong Kong Financial Secretary Paul Chan wrote in a Sunday blog post. He added that the virus \""will greatly increase the risk of continued economic contraction this year.\"""", 
""The Hong Kong government said Monday that the city's economic outlook this year is \""subject to high uncertainties,\"" including the global economy, trade and the protests. As for the coronavirus outbreak, the government said it would \""monitor the situation closely.\"""", ""Hong Kong, which has some level of autonomy from mainland China and its own immigration system, has managed to avoid the worst of the outbreak. Only 15 cases have been confirmed in the city, and there have been no deaths. Just over the border in mainland China, the number of confirmed cases totals more than 17,000, while at least 360 people have died."", 
""But the memory of 2003's SARS crisis looms large in Hong Kong, reminding its people of the toll a serious disease can take on the city. More than 280 of the 774 people who died from SARS were reported in Hong Kong, the highest death toll outside of mainland China. The SARS scare caused the city's economy to shrink 0.5% in the second quarter before it rebounded later in the year."", ""A 'double whammy' for businesses"", ""Last year's protest movement led millions of Hong Kongers to take to the streets and demand democratic and police reforms. Some clashes between protesters and police became violent, and tear gas, petrol bombs, rubber bullets and water cannons became part of the city's new normal."", 
""The protests hit the city's hospitality and food and beverage industries particularly hard.

The protests already took a heavy toll on the industry: The number of people who visited Hong Kong in November plunged by nearly half compared to a year earlier, according to the latest available government figures."", ""The coronavirus outbreak will likely exacerbate that problem. Most of Hong Kong's visitors come from mainland China, where many cities have placed their residents on lockdown. Hong Kong has also closed some of its border crossings into the mainland in an attempt to stop the virus from spreading."", 
""Too early to tell"", ""What's still uncertain is how dramatic and long lasting the effects of the coronavirus will be on Hong Kong's economy."", ""Iris Pang, an economist at ING, told CNN Business that she expects retail to be moderately affected by the outbreak, noting that last year's protests caused those businesses to take a big hit. But she added that ING doesn't think the virus will have a substantial impact on GDP."", ""Goldman Sachs on Friday cut its forecast for Hong Kong's economic growth in the first quarter from 5.6% to 4%. The analysts attributed that in large part to how the virus will impact the city's tourism, retail, hospitality, and food and beverage industries."",

""Zeman, of Lan Kwai Fong, the said it's too early to tell how bad the effects will be, since a lot of businesses are just now getting back to work after the Lunar New Year. The holiday ended last Wednesday, but many in the city typically take the whole week off."", ""But the government-mandated closures of schools and some public facilities, along with official encouragement that people stay indoors, will likely mean an uncertain future for many businesses."", ""\""It's not an easy situation, because at the moment, there's no light at the end of the tunnel,\"" said Zeman. \""I know many of my tenants, I don't know if they can survive.\"""",

It appears to be a cousin of CBD, the medicinal compound known for its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anticonvulsant activity."", 
""The discoveries were recently published in the journal Nature, Scientific Reports."", ""Discovering the compounds"", ""The compounds were isolated and identified from the Italian medical cannabis variety known as FM2 using mass spectrometry and metabolomics, processes used to find the basic chemicals of a sample or molecule."", ""The authors assessed the ability of THCP to bind to human cannabinoid receptors found in the endocannabinoid system by sending the compound to a lab to be tested in a tube."", 
""The endocannabinoid system's job is to keep our body in homeostasis, or equilibrium, and it regulates everything from sleep to appetite to inflammation to pain and more. When a person smokes marijuana, THC overwhelms the endocannabinoid system, latching on to cannabinoid receptors and interfering with their ability to communicate between neurons."", ""THCP bound strongly to both receptors -- 33 times more than THC does, and 63 times more than another compound called THCV. The finding led the authors to wonder if THCP might explain why some particularly potent cannabis varieties have a stronger effect than can be explained by the presence of THC alone."", 
""\""This means that these compounds have higher affinity for the receptors in the human body,\"" said Dr. Cinzia Citti, lead author of the research and post-doctoral fellow in life sciences at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia in Italy. \""In cannabis varieties where THC is present in very low concentrations, then we can think that the presence of another, more active cannabinoid can explain those effects.\"""", ""The role of alkyl side chains"", ""The alkyl side chain is the driving force behind a cannabinoid's effects on humans. For most of the nearly 150 cannabis compounds, including THC, the chain is only five atoms long, the authors said."", 
""However, THCP has a seven-atom chain, meaning that in its natural form it has surpassed the potency of THC."", ""A cannabinoid with more than five atoms has never been previously reported as naturally occurring, according to the authors. Additionally, most of them have neither been isolated nor characterized because of how challenging it is."", ""\""The challenge is that it can take a long time to isolate, especially with rare sources,\"" said Dr. Jane Ishmael, associate professor in Oregon State University's College of Pharmacy. \""I get the impression that these products were present in small amounts, so it's a surprise to find the natural products from a cannabis plant that we've known about for a long time.\"""", 
""Potential effects in humans"", ""CBD has mostly been the focus of studies on the health benefits of cannabis, but because THCP appears to show stronger binding abilities and potency, the authors think there is potential for health benefits."", ""The findings could enable the production of cannabis extracts for targeted physical effects; more testing with the study's methods could further the discovery and identification of new compounds, the authors said."", ""\""There are other minor cannabinoids and traces in the plant that can be hard to study, but by isolation we can continue to assess the effects they might offer,\"" Ishmael said."", 
""\""Historically, many of our medicines have been derived by or inspired by natural products. By having new compounds that bind with very high affinity, that will give scientists a new probe into biological sciences.\"""

""As O'Kelly sees it, the ATF has been deliberately misinterpreting a key gun control regulation for decades because officials fear that following the letter of the law would allow criminals to build AR-15s and other firearms piece by piece with unregulated parts."", ""He said he voiced his concerns to an ATF official two decades ago, but was rebuffed."", ""Now, however, his view is gaining traction in courtrooms around the country."", ""In December, a federal judge in Ohio dismissed weapons-related charges against two men after O'Kelly testified that the AR-15 part at issue in their case was not subject to federal law or regulation."", 
""US District Court Judge James G. Carr for the Northern District of Ohio called the ATF's long-standing interpretation of the regulation \""unreasonable and legally unacceptable.\"""", ""ATF said in a statement to CNN that it was reviewing that case and others involving the issue and would have no further comment until that review is complete. The agency declined to discuss O'Kelly's testimony as an expert witness."", ""A brief history lesson in gun control legislation is required to understand the unfolding controversy and O'Kelly's role in it."", 
""In the early days of gun control, every single part of a gun was subject to regulation under the Federal Firearms Act of 1938."", ""Three decades later, with the passage of the 1968 Gun Control Act, Congress sought to streamline what was considered an overly burdensome regulation by choosing a single part of a weapon as its key component for regulatory purposes."", ""Under the new law, manufacturers were required to stamp that part with a serial number for tracing purposes, and it would be subject to all the same laws as a completed firearm itself. Since 1993, that includes a provision that licensed dealers conduct criminal background checks on would-be buyers of the part, just as they would prospective purchasers of a fully intact firearm."", 
""This key part, according to the Gun Control Act, was referred to as \""the frame or receiver,\"" which is, generally speaking, the body of a firearm in the area surrounding the trigger."", ""An accompanying federal regulation provided a precise, highly technical definition:"", ""\""That part of a firearm which provides housing for the hammer, bolt or breechblock, and firing mechanism, and which is usually threaded at its forward portion to receive the barrel.\"""", ""The problem -- and this is where O'Kelly comes in -- is that he says roughly 60% of the guns in America do not have a single part that falls under that definition. The AR-15, for example, has a split receiver -- one upper and one lower. Neither meets the requirement on its own."", 
""\""For 50 years, ATF has been making this square peg fit in the round hole,\"" O'Kelly told CNN, \""when, in fact, it doesn't.\"""", ""At 64, with more than half his life devoted to law enforcement, first as a cop in Indiana, then as a federal agent, the last thing O'Kelly wants, he said, is to be seen as at odds with the ATF's mission of keeping guns from criminals."", ""He's not on a crusade, he insisted. He isn't seeking the spotlight."", ""Put simply, he said, \""when I'm asked to testify in court, I take an oath to tell the truth, and I have.\"""", 
""Since leaving the ATF in 2011, and forming his own firearms training and consulting firm, O'Kelly has been a paid expert witness in at least four cases in which he has detailed his view that the AR-15 and many other guns don't have a single part that is subject to federal law and regulation."", ""The first time was in 2014 after he got a call from a San Diego area lawyer asking his opinion about a case involving the seizure of approximately 6,000 polymer gun parts the ATF had determined were \""receivers\"" under the law. The devices were taken as part of a criminal investigation into a Southern California-based company Ares Armor, which was suspected of dealing firearms without a license."", 
""The company's owner at the time, Dimitri Karras, was never charged with a crime. His company later filed a civil lawsuit against the ATF seeking the return of his property. O'Kelly submitted a declaration in support of Karras' lawsuit, stating that the lower receivers \""had only two of the four features listed by the ATF in their own definition of a 'receiver.'\"""", ""He also noted that the definition failed to cover a long list of semi-automatic rifles and handguns, including the very popular Ruger .22 caliber pistol and Uzi-style rifles. The regulation, O'Kelly wrote, pertained mainly to a part found in manually operated weapons such as revolvers and pump action shotguns."", 
""He said the ATF's attempt to classify the items seized from Ares Armor as receivers, as well as similar rulings in other cases, displayed \""a lack of logic and consistency, which has created a climate in the firearm industry wherein it is nearly impossible for the reasonable man to be able to operate in good faith within the law.\"""", ""The ATF returned 5,786 lower receivers to Karras two months after O'Kelly's declaration was filed. The civil case was later dismissed."", ""A year later, O'Kelly was called upon again -- this time by lawyers in Oakland, California on behalf of a man who had purchased a lower receiver for an AR-15 style machine gun from an undercover ATF agent in the parking garage of a shopping mall."", 
""Prosecutors charged Alejandro Jimenez, a convicted felon, with illegally possessing and failing to register a machine gun based on the notion that the lower receiver he bought was a machine gun all by itself under the law."", ""But O'Kelly said prosecutors were wrong to designate the item Jimenez purchased as a receiver."", ""\""It is simply a piece of cast metal that must be equipped with numerous parts in order to become a weapon,\"" he wrote."", ""The judge, citing the disconnect between the regulation and the item Jimenez possessed, subsequently dismissed the indictment, and prosecutors abandoned the case."", 
""In wake of the dismissal, then-US Attorney General Loretta Lynch wrote a letter to Congress outlining the issues. She advised lawmakers that the judge's order was not suitable for appeal and that if ATF officials believed the definition of a receiver should be changed, they should pursue regulatory or administrative action."", ""The ATF did neither. And it would not be long before the dispute over what constitutes a receiver would arise again."", ""This time the stakes were much higher. The case involved a man accused of running an AR-15 style factory South of Los Angeles. Prosecutors alleged that Joseph Roh was illegally manufacturing the weapons for $1,000 a piece and had at least 19 convicted felons among his clients."", 
""Roh opted for a bench trial, placing his fate in the hands of a judge alone. A central issue of the case was whether the lower receivers he stocked in his factory could fairly be considered firearms under the federal law."", ""Roh's lawyer, Gregory Nicolaysen, said O'Kelly came across as a \""very neutral, very technical\"" witness in stating that they could not."", ""But he said there was also a \""certain vehemence\"" in his testimony that stemmed from his view that his former agency had been ignoring the problem for decades."", 
""\""O'Kelly brings an intrinsic understanding of the agency, the agency's arrogance, and its willingness to be deceptive,\"" Nicolaysen said. \""He was a turning point in the litigation.\"""", ""Though prosecutors had argued that adopting O'Kelly's view, \""would sweep aside more than 50 years of the ATF's regulation of AR-15s and other semi-automatic firearms,\"" the judge issued a tentative order doing just that."", ""Faced with the order, prosecutors cut a no-prison-time deal with Roh in order to prevent the tentative order from becoming final, drawing publicity and creating case law that could hamper ATF enforcement efforts."", 
""A CNN story on the case ricocheted around the gun world and in federal courthouses. A week after it was published, Carr, the judge in Ohio, directed both the prosecution and defense in the case he was overseeing to address the tentative order in the Roh case and Lynch's letter."", ""Federal prosecutors in Ohio had charged two men, Richard Rowold and Steven Robison, with conspiring to illegally purchase more than four dozen AR-15 lower receivers. Rowold, a convicted felon, was charged with illegally possessing the devices. Robison was accused of illegally purchasing them on Rowold's behalf, though authorities belatedly discovered that Robison, too, had a criminal record that should have prohibited him from buying them as well."", 
""When agents searched Rowold's apartment in March of 2018 they found a box with an attached receipt showing he had purchased the lower receivers for $1,700 and that they were to be delivered to Robison, according to a search warrant affidavit. Only 15 of the 50 that were shipped remained in the box."", ""Defense attorneys for both men argued that their cases should be thrown out because the lower receivers are not firearms, as the ATF contends, and are therefore not subject to any regulation or laws."", 
""Following dueling motions on the issue, Carr called for an evidentiary hearing in September, 2019. It was focused on an increasingly familiar question: Whether lower receivers qualified as a firearm under the 1968 Gun Control Act and the related federal regulation."", ""Prosecutors, as they had in earlier cases, acknowledged that AR-15 lower receivers did not perfectly fit the definition in the relevant federal code."", ""But they argued that the ATF's interpretation that they were covered nonetheless was reasonable and consistent with the intent of the act."", 
""They noted that there was a preamble to the \""definitions\"" section of the code that provided the caveat \""unless manifestly incompatible with the act.\"""", ""To rule that an AR-15 lower receiver was not a receiver would be \""manifestly incompatible\"" with Congress' intent, they argued."", ""O'Kelly once again took the stand as an expert witness for the defense."", ""He told the judge that, legally, lower receivers were no more subject to ATF regulation than \""a lamp shade, for example,\"" but that the agency had insisted otherwise for decades."", 
""He was cross-examined by James Vann, assistant chief counsel for the ATF. Vann, assigned to ATF headquarters in Washington, DC, had traveled to Ohio to represent the government in the case."", ""Vann asked O'Kelly about his tenure at the ATF National Academy and whether he taught new agents that the AR-15 did not have a receiver."", ""\""No, I did not,\"" O'Kelly responded. \""That would have been seriously frowned upon by the agency.\"""", ""When Vann pressed him on why he didn't include that information in his curriculum, O'Kelly replied, \""It wasn't allowed.\"""", 
""At that point the judge intervened, asking the same question."", ""O'Kelly told Carr he voiced his concerns to an official named Richard Turner at ATF headquarters, but was told \""we're not going to teach that.\"""", ""O'Kelly added, \""I could only teach what was approved by headquarters.\"""", ""Turner declined comment through an ATF spokeswoman."", ""Following his testimony, O'Kelly submitted a declaration in the case saying it was his professional opinion that roughly 60 percent of the firearms in America do not have a single part that qualifies as a receiver under the current regulation."", 
""In siding with the defense, Carr wrote that the ATF's long-standing interpretation was \""plainly erroneous and inconsistent with the regulation.\"""", ""He added, \""misapplying the law for a long time provides no immunity from scrutiny.\"""", ""The Associated Press was first to report the outcome of the case and Carr's comments."", ""Adam Winkler, a constitutional law professor at UCLA and an expert on the second amendment, said the ruling exposed \""another major loophole in federal gun laws\"" and predicted it would lead to a surge in so-called \""ghost guns,\"" homemade weapons assembled from individual parts, none of which bear serial numbers, if the problem wasn't fixed."", 
""\""This ruling will speed the way toward more and more unregulated firearms,\"" Winkler told CNN."", ""Jay Jacobson, a California-based gunmaker who has hired O'Kelly as a consultant and considers him a friend, said the former agent would take no joy in seeing his testimony benefit bad guys."", ""\""Dan doesn't want to see criminals getting loose,\"" Jacobson said. \""But if there is not a crime, he's going to testify in your defense. If you don't like that, change the law.\"""", ""The morning after Carr's ruling was made public, O'Kelly met with a CNN reporter at a gun shop a short drive from his seasonal home in central Florida."", 
""He did some show and tell with an AR-15, talked about his years as an ATF agent, and shot the breeze with Carey Baker, the shop owner, who also happens to be a former Florida state representative and senator."", ""Baker, whose shop was established in 1886, said he did not want any ambiguity in gun laws and regulations."", ""\""As a dealer, with everything I own at risk, I need clear language,\"" Baker said. \""I want to comply. I don't want to jeopardize 130 years' worth of business.\"""", ""He said he knew an AR-15 lower receiver didn't meet the definition in the regulation, but that he treated it as a firearm anyway."", 
""\""It shouldn't be that way, but that's how it is,\"" Baker said. \""They need to better define what they're attempting to regulate.\"""", ""O'Kelly, now eight years removed from the ATF, said he believes it is \""mere arrogance\"" that's behind the problematic language lasting for as long as it has."", ""\""We're just going to say it applies -- so tough,\"" is how he characterized the institutional mindset."", ""He said he has deep respect for, and remains friendly with, many of his former colleagues."", ""He's heard from some of them that his opinions -- or his willingness to express them -- have not gone over well within the agency.

""\""Every time this comes up, it's like 'kill the messenger',\"" O'Kelly said. \""I'm the bad guy.\"""", ""\""It stings,\"" he acknowledged."", ""But he said he was not responsible for writing the law or regulation; He has merely testified truthfully when asked about them in court."", ""\""If you have a problem with the truth,\"" O'Kelly said, \""who's the bad guy?\"""", """", """

Are wu my widdle baby?\"" If your idea of \""baby talk\"" makes you throw up in your mouth a little, then it's time to get educated."", ""True baby talk, which a new study shows can boost infant brain and speech development, is actually proper adult speech, just delivered in a different cadence."", ""\""It uses real words and correct grammar, but it does use a higher pitch, a slower tempo and an exaggerated intonation,\"" said Naja Ferjan Ramirez, an assistant professor at the department of linguistics at the University of Washington."", 
""\""What people think of as baby talk is a combination of silly sounds and words, sometimes with incorrect grammar,\"" Ferjan Ramirez explained, \""like 'Oooh, your shozie wozies on your widdle feets.' \"""", ""'Not just listening but talking'"", ""A parenting speaking style that is used in nearly every language in the world, true \""baby talk\"" became known as \""motherese\"" and today is called \""parentese\"" -- because, after all, it's not just moms who use it. Many dads, grandparents, older siblings, aunts, uncles and babysitters speak parentese, intuitively aware that it helps the baby tune in socially and respond, even if only through babbling."", 
""\""Parentese has three characteristics,\"" said Patricia Kuhl, the co-director of the Institute for Learning & Brain Sciences at the University of Washington, who has been studying children's early language learning for decades."", ""\""One of them is that it has a higher overall pitch, about an octave higher,\"" Kuhl said. \""Another is that intonation contours are very curvy; the highs are higher, the lows are lower, and it sounds excited and happy."", ""\""And then it's slower, with pauses between phrases to give the baby time to participate in this social interaction,\"" Kuhl said."", 
""As it turns out, encouraging the \""social brain\"" is key to boosting a baby's speech and language development, said Kuhl, an internationally known pioneer in the use of brain imaging."", ""And babies instinctively prefer it -- as if they are wired to respond. Maybe they are."", ""Kuhl shared a video from an older experiment starring 7-month-old \""Paul\"" to illustrate a baby's preference for parentese."", ""In the black and white video, Paul sits on his mother's lap in an enclosed space. On Paul's left side, out of site behind a wall, a woman speaks eight seconds of parentese. On his right, a woman speaks in a normal adult tone. Paul samples both, then consistently prefers the voice speaking parentese."", 
""Kuhl's lab has done studies which show when infants listen to speech, \""not only does the auditory cortex area in their brain light up, but the motor areas that will eventually speak light up,\"" she said, showing the baby is getting ready to talk back."", ""\""The more parents naturally use parentese in their homes when speaking to their children, the better and faster those language skills develop,\"" Kuhl said. \""So, it turns out that parentese is a social catalyst for language. It gets kids not just listening but talking.\"""", 
""Can you boost parentese with coaching?"", ""In 2018, Kuhl and Ferjan Ramirez published a study that showed when parents were coached in parentese, their babies babbled more and had more words by 14 months than those who were not trained."", ""In a new study published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the team reports on speech development in the same group of babies at 18 months. Despite the fact that all 48 participating families used some parentese at the start of the study, it was the babies of coached parents who showed significant gains in conversational turn-taking and vocalizations between 14 and 18 months."", 
""\""Children of coached parents produced real words, such as ball or milk, at almost twice the rate of children whose parents were in the control group,\"" Ferjan Ramirez said."", ""In addition, she said, babies whose parents were coached had an average vocabulary of 100 words compared to the 60 words in the control group."", ""Just how did researchers measure the improvement over this period? For an entire weekend when the babies were 6, 10, 14 and 18-months old, all 48 sets of parents dressed their babies with vests with built-in audio recorders that captured all of their interactions."", 
""Then parents randomly assigned to receive instruction then came into the lab for one-on-one coaching when their baby was 6, 10 and 14 months."", ""After receiving education on the science behind the benefits of speaking to their babies, the parents also listened to themselves using parentese. They were also coached on how to incorporate more parentese into the day, and encouraged to engage their babies in back-and-forth exchanges called conversational turns."", ""In the lab, an interaction is counted as a \""turn\"" if the baby responds with an utterance within a second or two, Kuhl explained, with more turn-taking highly correlated with the baby's future success in language."", 
""\""Babies need to be engaged socially in order to learn language. They have to have a drive to communicate. They have to want to, and parentese seems to help make them want to,\"" Kuhl said."", ""The study is continuing. At this time the babies are about three, old enough to undergo brain imaging with new MRIs that, Kuhl stresses, are quite safe at that age. While publication of any new findings will take time, Kuhl is encouraged."", ""\""Measures of language skill continue to show that the kids in the coached group are way ahead of the kids in the control group,\"" Kuhl said. \""And scans of white and gray matter in the brain will show if there are permanent changes induced by this style of interacting with a child."", 
""\""Have we strengthened the connectivity between the areas of the brain responsible for language development?\"" Kuhl asked. \""I'll be very interested to find out.\"""

For them, a promotion to leadership can mean an unhappy shift away from what they enjoy and do well."", ""Such a move up can also hurt employers if the person they promote isn't happy or skilled in management. After all, bad managers are often why employees underperform or quit."", 
""Nevertheless, individual contributors who don't want to be managers still want to ascend in terms of pay, professional prestige and what they produce."", ""What companies can do to retain talented 'non-managers'"", ""Companies need to consider creating a second pathway to promotion, said Johnny Taylor president and CEO of the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM)."", ""\""There are two ladders -- one is the compensation ladder and one is the span-of-control ladder. The individual contributor doesn't necessarily want span of control, but they have to see a way up,\"" Taylor said."", 
""Employers also need to focus on ways that employees can improve and expand their skills and stay engaged, beyond just earning more money."", ""Companies that don't offer growth opportunities could risk alienating some of the best talent, said Danny Nelms, president of the Work Institute, which studies employee engagement and retention."", ""\""If you're not seen as a company that invests in people with opportunities for growth you won't attract the people you need,\"" Nelms said."", ""Anyone who doesn't want to manage should ask potential employers directly, \""Do you have alternative routes to make more money and achieve more prestige in this role?\"" advises Marcus Buckingham, the head of people and performance research at the ADP Research Institute and coauthor of \""Nine Lies About Work.\"""", 
""\""That's one of the most important questions to assess the effectiveness of the organization,\"" Buckingham said."", ""Alternative ladders in some industries but not others"", ""To some extent, those routes already exist in some industries, at least for the very top talent who can potentially make more than their bosses, Taylor noted."", ""For instance, a world renowned surgeon may make more than the head of her department or hospital. The same goes for star football coaches who can earn more than the university president, or media personalities whose paychecks can top that of some network executives."", 
""The IT industry has created advancement opportunities for developers and other engineers to achieve higher pay and say without necessarily having to manage others directly."", ""But in other professions, such as nursing, that's often not the case. Usually to advance, a nurse needs to move away from nursing into a supervisory role. \""It's very hard to move up. To grow, you have to nurse less,\"" Buckingham said."", ""The Work Institute worked with two healthcare organizations in the Midwest to help them reduce high nurse turnover. One of the successful remedies was to create new career ladders for nurses, Nelms said. That included assistance to obtain advanced degrees, residency programs and higher pay for different levels of achievement."", 
""Employers in any industry seeking creativity, excellence and depth of expertise, not to mention high employee engagement, will undercut those goals if all the money and prestige go to those on the management track, Buckingham said."", ""Otherwise, he cautioned, \""You get no innovation, no speed, no mastery. You end up with a company full of project managers.\"""

Job losses could spur a tide of housing foreclosures, Zhao added, compounding the country's economic woes."", """", ""'We will die' without more money"", 
""Some business owners have gone public with their plight. Beijing entrepreneur Wu Hai wrote on social media app WeChat this week that the outbreak could destroy more than 50 karaoke bars he runs across the country. The pastime has been halted as the government maintains a shutdown of popular entertainment spots where \""cross infection risks\"" are high."", ""In the post, Wu lamented the closures and said the lack of business puts his 1,500 workers at risk of losing their jobs. He wrote that his company, MeiKTV, has about 12 million yuan ($1.7 million) in cash on hand, giving it about two months to survive if he's unable to reopen for business."", 
""\""That means we will die in April unless investors continue to give us money,\"" he wrote."", """", ""Shu Congxuan, chairman of Home Original Chicken, said last Saturday that his fast food chain has shut more than 400 stores since the outbreak began. In a Weibo post, he warned that his company is in danger of running out of cash, since it still needs to pay rent and employees. But he said he would try to make sure his employees keep their jobs, even if he needs to sell his houses and cars."", ""Other companies appear to be taking desperate measures to recoup at least some of their losses. Beijing-based Meizhou Dongpo Restaurant said on Weibo that its employees have set up stalls to sell fresh vegetables on the street. While the company did not elaborate on the reason for its decision, a local government-run newspaper reported that the restaurant had purchased fresh produce for the Lunar New Year holiday season, but was unable to use it because of the outbreak."", 
""The outcome for many businesses could be dire if the situation does not improve rapidly. According to the Tsinghua University and Peking University survey of firms, 85% of respondents said they would go out of business if the outbreak lasts three months. By the six month mark, 90% of the companies would collapse."", """", ""Even a recovery in the near future may not come soon enough for some. Before the outbreak, Chinese companies were preparing to pay back or refinance a lot of debt this year, according to analysts at S&P Global Ratings. Given the rising risk to the economy, they may find it harder to borrow."", 
""The S&P researchers warned in a note this week that if the public health crisis stabilizes next month, liquidity will still be under pressure through at least the first half of the year. They added that the outbreak will also heighten the risk of default for Chinese companies."", ""Government may need to do more"", ""Beijing already knows that it has a major problem on its hands. Before the outbreak, senior officials had characterized the prevention of mass unemployment as their top priority for 2020. Now that the likelihood of mass job losses is increasing, the country is going all out to stop it from happening."", 
""Some of the most prominent companies in China, for example, are taking in workers displaced by the outbreak. JD.com (JD), one of China's largest e-commerce firms, earlier this week promised to open up more than 20,000 new positions. Alibaba (BABA) announced a similar plan."", ""The government is also stepping in. Last week, the People's Bank of China pumped billions of dollars into the money market to shore up banks' ability to lend money. The central bank also set up a 300 billion yuan ($43 billion) special fund to provide cheap loans to key companies in epidemic prevention. Meanwhile, the finance ministry announced government subsidies to make those loans even cheaper."", 
""Local governments in Beijing, Shanghai and several provinces have also rolled out targeted measures to help small businesses, including offering subsidies to landlords so they can reduce rents, and allowing small companies to delay the payment of social security contributions or taxes."", ""But it's not clear how helpful some of those policies will be."", ""Wu, the karaoke bar owner, wrote in his WeChat post that he felt his company was still at a \""dead end\"" even with the policies offered to him. Social security, for example, is still a major expense for employers. Wu suggested that simply delaying those payments would not really help."", 
""\""Social Security Bureau, how generous you are,\"" Wu commented sarcastically. \""Our employees are going to lose jobs. The company is going to collapse. You not only don't want to take some money out, but you still want to collect money from us — not even a penny less!\"""", ""Wu did not respond to a request for comment from CNN Business. But in his WeChat post he also criticized the usefulness of giving subsidies to landlords. While he said the policy is \""well intended,\"" he questioned whether landlords would actually reduce the amount their tenants pay."", 
""He also doubted the effectiveness of preferential loans set up by the central bank."", ""\""We have no fixed assets as collateral. We have no operating cash flows — because we can't open for business — as collateral,\"" Wu wrote. \""Tell me, which small and medium-sized company can get the bank funding?\"""

"""", ""But the conference appears to have led to a chain of transmission for Walsh, who left Singapore on January 24 to fly to the French Alps, where he spent four days vacationing in a ski chalet in Contamines-Montjoie, southeast France."", ""France on Saturday confirmed five new cases of the virus, all of them British nationals, including one 9-year-old child who had spent time in a school in the resort. The patients were infected after coming into contact with a UK citizen who had traveled from Singapore, according to local health official Jean-Yves Grall."", 
"""", ""Walsh left the French ski resort on January 28, taking an EasyJet flight from nearby Geneva, Switzerland to London's Gatwick airport."", ""Walsh said in his statement Tuesday that he contacted his doctor and health authorities as soon as he knew he had been exposed to a confirmed case of coronavirus. \""I was advised to attend an isolated room at hospital, despite showing no symptoms, and subsequently self-isolated at home as instructed. When the diagnosis was confirmed I was sent to an isolation unit in hospital, where I remain, and, as a precaution, my family was also asked to isolate themselves.\"""", 
""Four further patients in England tested positive for coronavirus on Monday, bringing the country's total tally to eight, the UK Department of Health said in a statement. The new cases are all known contacts of a previously confirmed UK case, and the virus was passed on to them in France, it said."", """", ""The agency also declared the virus a \""serious and imminent threat to public health,\"" which gives officials authority to impose quarantine restrictions on people who \""could present a risk of infecting or contaminating others.\"""", 
""Some media have suggested that Walsh may be a \""super-spreader\"" of the virus, meaning a single patient who transmits the infection to many other people, but experts urge caution."", ""University of Edinburgh infectious disease expert Mark Woolhouse told CNN: \""I don't think it's helpful to highlight an individual.\"" That's because it's not clear how many people he actually infected, whether he \""sheds\"" the virus more readily than any other person, or whether he was simply in contact with more people and thus, more likely to pass the virus on. Woolhouse prefers the term \""super spreading event.\"""", 
""World Health Organization (WHO) Executive Director Dr. Michael J Ryan called on the media not to personalize the disease, while answering a question about Walsh on Tuesday."", ""Ryan dismissed reports that Walsh was a \""super spreader,\"" saying the circumstances around his case were \""unfortunate\"" but \""by no means a massive super spreading event.\"""", """", ""As fears over the transmission of coronavirus grow, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus  said on Monday: \""In recent days, we have seen some concerning instances of onward transmission from people with no travel history to China, like the cases reported in France yesterday and the United Kingdom today. The detection of this small number of cases could be the spark that becomes a bigger fire. But for now, it's only a spark. Our objective remains containment.\"""", 
""EasyJet said it was notified by British health authorities about an infected passenger on board, but that as of Monday there had been no other confirmed cases from that flight, nor had any passengers shown symptoms."", ""French authorities have \""managed to contact and trace all people who were in contact with the British tourists who were in the village,\"" health minister Agnes Buzyn told French CNN affiliate BFM. The ski center plans to remain open, according to Etienne Jacquet, the mayor of Contamines-Montjoie."", 
""The Grand Hyatt in Singapore, meanwhile, said no one who contracted the virus showed symptoms while at the luxury hotel, and none of its staff has tested positive. When it learned of cases originating on its property the hotel said it immediately started taking the temperature of its guests, and its staff twice a day. It has also brought in an outside government agency to sanitize and \""deep clean\"" affected public areas and guestrooms."

Restrictions have been implemented in many other places too -- but there is also pressure for companies to get back to work, with Chinese President Xi Jinping warning this week that the country needed to stabilize its economy."", ""In an attempt to limit social contact to slow the spread of the virus, known officially as Covid-19, millions of employees in China and other affected areas are currently working from home."", 
""For some employees, like teachers who have conducted classes digitally for weeks, working from home can be a nightmare."", ""But in other sectors, this unexpected experiment has been so well received that employers are considering adopting it as a more permanent measure. For those who advocate more flexible working options, the past few weeks mark a possible step toward widespread -- and long-awaited -- reform."", """", ""Frustrations and unexpected benefits"", ""In China, the outbreak has taken a toll on the world's second biggest economy, which had already been struggling due to the US trade war and a slump in domestic demand. Now, businesses have been closed for weeks, raising fears of mass lay-offs, unemployment, and housing foreclosures."", 
""One estimate warned that the outbreak could cost China $62 billion in lost growth."", ""With authorities urging businesses to reopen, employees across China are beginning to work from home. More than half of workers in the capital Beijing plan to do so instead of going into the office, according to state-run newspaper China Daily."", ""Tech companies including Tencent, Alibaba and Microsoft have told CNN their staff will work from home for the next one to two weeks, citing health and safety concerns."", 
""The governments of Singapore, Hong Kong, and Macao have ordered civil servants to work from home and asked private employers to do so where possible, with only essential staff or emergency service providers still at the office."", ""Civil servants in Hong Kong have been working from home for weeks, since the Lunar New Year holiday ended in late January.  A Hong Kong government statement said it \""appealed to other employers to make flexible work arrangements for employees in order to reduce contacts among people.\"""", 
""Schools in many of these places have been suspended -- so teachers are instead conducting classes through digital learning tools, such as Google Hangouts and other video conferencing software. One Hong Kong school requires students to \""check in\"" digitally and do lesson tasks online with hourly deadlines, so if students skip a class, it leaves a digital record."", ""But bringing the classroom online has proved frustrating for some educators -- especially those who work with children who have special learning needs or disabilities."", 
""\""We use a lot of hands-on learning, so it's been really challenging trying to make our online learning meaningful for the kids when we're not in a classroom environment,\"" said Karen, a special education teacher in Hong Kong, who requested a pseudonym to avoid identifying the school."", ""Like other schools, Karen and her colleagues have relied on digital tools such as video calls and Google Docs -- but challenges are made harder because her students need a lot of adult support."", ""\""The parents are also working from home, and are having to also be teachers -- it's almost an impossible situation,\"" she said."", 
""Special needs students also often rely on the structure, routine, and human interaction provided by school -- which means remote learning can be unsettling or frustrating."", ""But for other digital-based sectors, working from home has instead been surprisingly effective, say employers in the field."", ""\""It's a test run that we didn't really choose to implement, but we're quite happy with it,\"" said Brice Lamarque, sales and accounts director at a web and branding agency in Hong Kong. Nearly all the agency's employees have been working from home this month -- and will continue for as long as the Hong Kong government advises, he said."", 
""\""Before (the epidemic) happened, we were not really keen on letting our team work from home because we value collaboration,\"" said Lamarque. \""But this experience actually showed us that the whole team collaborates quite well even if they're not in the same room, so we're looking at adding that into our employee benefits ... maybe two to three weeks a year.\"""", ""However, he admitted that a big part of the work-from-home success owed to the digital nature of their company and industry -- employees only require a computer and internet connection, meaning they can work from anywhere."", 
""Joe Hasberry, a Hong Kong employee at an asset management firm, has also been working from home -- but unlike Lamarque, he and other coworkers will be returning to the office next week. The company needs to meet with clients and visitors, meaning it's hard to keep working from home beyond a few weeks."", ""\""Some guys at my office are more (in) investor relations -- it's much more people-centric, so that part of the job wouldn't be able to be done from home,\"" he said."", ""Meanwhile, some people face social pressure from employers to go into the office despite government guidance to work from home. Employees in customer service industries or front-of-house roles often don't have the option to work remotely."", 
""In China, factory workers also don't have this choice -- instead, those able to return will face stringent health and safety measures each day, like having their body temperatures checked and hands disinfected before entering the workplace, according to state-run media Xinhua."", ""Some employees in Hong Kong told CNN that they were frustrated that the arrangement could put them at a higher risk of infection, heightened by memories of the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak that devastated the city."", 
""Is this the future of work?"", ""Although digitally-based industries may be better suited to work from home, advocates have been pushing for years to make work more flexible, arguing that it can be done with the right infrastructure, to the benefit of both employees and employers."", ""The past decade has seen expanding opportunities for remote working and increasing remote job listings -- and this shift is largely due to new technologies and changing family demographics."", ""The movement has been embraced by many parents who say the ability to work from home makes it easier to juggle childcare and a career. Many families who can't afford nannies or day care face a difficult decision when they have a baby, with one of the parents -- often the woman -- having to sacrifice career advancement to care for their child."", 
""The option to work from home doesn't just empower women -- it makes it easier for working fathers to step into that role too, in a step toward gender equality that benefits all parties."", ""Technological advancements have also made working from home more accessible across all sectors."", ""\""Nowadays, compared to 10 years ago, it is a lot easier to access emails remotely, cloud-based filing, dial-in to calls and video conferencing remotely,\"" said Marie Swarbreck, founder of FLEXImums, a company in Hong Kong that connects job applicants to remote or flexible work opportunities. \""The technology and software is available for people to work remotely.\"""", 
""She acknowledged that the current work-from-home situation in Hong Kong has produced \""extra challenges which are out of our control\"" -- for instance, working parents have to care for children whose classes have been suspended. Homes that are empty, quiet, and perfect for remote working on a typical day are now filled with people and distractions."", ""But these are extraordinary circumstances -- not the norm, she said. Current challenges don't mean that working from home is ineffective, or that it shouldn't be implemented more widely beyond the outbreak."",

""They only increased after the death of Li Wenliang, a Wuhan doctor who had tried to raise the alarm about the virus, officially known as Covid-19, only to be reprimanded by police. Li passed away in hospital last week from the virus, after belatedly being praised by Chinese authorities. Following his death, hundreds of thousands of people posted demands for free speech online -- that were themselves quickly scrubbed by the censors."", ""As the outrage threatened to boil over, Beijing quickly dispatched an anti-corruption task force to Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province -- the epicenter of the outbreak, with the clear implication that they would come back with some scalps to assuage public anger. At the same time, state media ramped up positive stories about efforts to rein in the outbreak, and Xi himself made his first public appearance related to the virus."", 
""Xi's reappearance came after weeks of being away from front pages and newscasts, as the propaganda authorities cleared the decks for him to ensure that he could be cast as the nation's protector, and avoid any of the blame for the myriad missteps by authorities in Hubei and elsewhere. On Thursday it was announced that Ying Yong, a key Xi ally, had been appointed to run Hubei, while other Xi proteges have been dispatched to Wuhan to help clean up the political mess there."", ""There are signs, however, that the lid will not be so easily put back on the Pandora's box that Li's death has opened."", 
""In the past week, multiple open letters have been circulated online, apparently signed by prominent Chinese academics and intellectuals, and demanding the government honor constitutional protections for free speech. The China Human Rights Lawyers Group, a China-based NGO, also called for February 6, the date of Li's death, to be declared the \""People's Day of Truth.\"""", """", ""\""For 30 years the Chinese people have been made to surrender their freedom in exchange for safety, and now they fall prey to a public health crisis and are less safe than ever,\"" read one letter translated and published by China Change, a US-based website with strong ties to the Chinese dissident community. It adds that the crisis and its after effects are the \""price for giving up freedom and suppressing expression.\"""", 
""\""(The government) has used disease control as a pretext to illegally deprive citizens of their constitutional rights, including the right to free speech, right to freedom of movement, and the right to private property,\"" the letter said."", ""In the version published by China Change the letter lists nine signatories, including Xu Zhangrun, a law professor at Tsinghua University and one of China's most prominent jurists."", ""Multiple copies of the letters are circulating online, and CNN has been unable to confirm the entire list of signatories. Xu Zhangrun did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday."", 
""In a separate essay published this week, Xu blamed Xi \""and the cabal that surrounds him\"" for the crisis."", ""\""The political life of the nation is in a state of collapse and the ethical core of the system has been rendered hollow,\"" Xu wrote. \""The ultimate concern of China's polity today and that of its highest leader is to preserve at all costs the privileged position of the Communist Party and to maintain ruthlessly its hold on power.\"""", ""The essay was initially published in Chinese by Matters, a news and commentary site popular with liberal intellectuals that is banned in China. It was translated with Xu's permission into English by China scholar Geremie Barme."", 
"""", ""Looking back on the repercussions he faced for speaking out against Xi in 2018, when the president removed all barriers on his serving for life, Xu added that \""I can now all too easily predict that I will be subjected to new punishments; indeed, this may well even be the last piece I write.\"""", ""The omens aren't good for Xu and other signatories. Their letters have echoes of Charter 08, a manifesto published on December 10, 2008, the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, calling for a new Chinese constitution recognizing democracy, freedom of speech and the rule of law."", 
""Initially signed by around 300 people, a figure that would later grow into the thousands, Charter 08's publication came on the back of a relaxation of state control in the run-up to the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Nevertheless, it provoked a fierce reaction from the Chinese government, and dozens of its initial signatories were called in for interrogation and otherwise harassed by the security services."", ""The primary target of the government was Liu Xiaobo, an academic and author who helped draft Charter 08. Liu was arrested and eventually imprisoned for 11-years for \""inciting subversion of state power.\"" Liu died of liver cancer in 2017, while he was on \""medical parole\"" but still under tight security. During the almost-decade his spent in prison, he received the Nobel Peace Prize and was hailed as one of China's leading dissidents."", 
""Liu's extreme punishment -- and the refusal of authorities to grant him a medical parole until the very last days of his illness -- was indicative of how serious a threat Beijing viewed Charter 08 to be."", """", ""While many of the demands -- both in the recent letters and Charter 08 -- are merely for the authorities to respect freedoms supposedly protected by the Chinese constitution, they challenge the fundamental basis of one party rule. While the constitution may guarantee free speech or assembly, all its provisions are seen as subject to Party approval or discretion, something Chinese liberals see as antithetical to the rule of law."", 
""In recent years, and certainly since Xi assumed power in 2013, the ruling Communist Party has moved to increase its control over civil society. This could mean that even though the open letters published this week are far more modest in their demands than Charter 08, they nevertheless risk incurring a major backlash for their signatories."", ""This is not least because as well as echoing Liu's document, the letter signed by Xu and others also hints at the ongoing anti-government protests in Hong Kong, listing five demands \""in the name of the people.\"" Hong Kong pro-democracy protesters have long used \""five demands, not one less,\"" as a key rallying cry for their own grievances."", 
""Since the development of the Great Firewall, the number one target of the censors has always been calls for protests or offline organizing. While the censors have allowed a certain degree of anger over Li Wenliang's death, and Xi has been careful to channel frustration at officials in Wuhan so it does not bubble over into more sustained dissent, any association with Charter 08 and Hong Kong, even unintentional, may prove to be too much for the authorities to tolerate."

In the 2018 fiscal year, the most recent year for which State Department data is available, Americans adopted 1,475 children from China."",

""Not knowing when they'll be able to see Ruby is particularly hard because of everything that she's been through, even before the coronavirus outbreak."", ""Ruby was abandoned in a hospital bathroom when she was 6 months old, the Clevelands said, and has been diagnosed with hydrocephalus, a condition characterized by excess fluid buildup in the brain that can lead to brain damage."", ""But they've faced challenges before, and they know they can overcome this one too, they said."", ""\""I know that this is just a part of our story, it's part of Ruby's story and how incredible will it be to be able to tell her, look what we did to fight for you?\"" Noah Cleveland said."",

Some 3,700 people aboard remain forcibly quartered; at least 135 passengers have tested positive for the virus."", 
""Crew members, forced to continue working, are pleading. \""We are extremely scared,\"" said Binay Kumar Sakar in a video obtained by CNN. That was before this ship became part prison, part hospital, part Twilight Zone luxury resort. Employees say the requirement that they work, interacting with potentially infected passengers, leaves them utterly unprotected; several workers have already become infected. CNN has reached out to Princess Cruises for comment. Their fear is particularly resonant across an industry which, as a whole, has long been known for in the past exploiting some of its workers."", 
""Among the passengers, some say they are tolerating the confinement fairly well, but it's hard to imagine what enduring this experience is like for people in the less luxurious interior cabins. A ship's \""state rooms,\"" as they are called, tend to be small. The ones without a view of the sea and with more limited space must be a nightmare of claustrophobia."", ""Is this the best way to deal with a viral outbreak?"", ""The highly contagious virus is a minefield of ethical, political and moral dilemmas. That it emerged in China, a country ruled by an authoritarian, politically-repressive regime, wrapped the crisis in a uniquely chilling atmosphere."", 
""Governments, public health experts and private firms are trying to figure out how to respond to the crisis; much of the response appears improvised. On Tuesday, the World Health Organization said that the virus presents a \""grave threat\"" to the world and \""one clinical trial is already on the way\"" in China in an attempt to find a cure; the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also offered experts Tuesday to help study the virus in China. But many aboard cruise ships remain in limbo."", 
""The complaints of the Diamond Princess crew point to the risks of the current lockdown approach aboard these ships. Crew members are not trained as health care workers. Passenger ships are not meant to be quarantine areas. They are not designed or equipped for this purpose. Their employees did not sign up for this type of work. Passengers should be permitted to disembark and safely move to a different facility, on firm ground, where they can be tested; where the necessary supplies are on hand; where the staff is doing the work for which they were trained."", 
""This virus has unsurprisingly created a multitude of tough decisions."", ""From the moment we learned that a new virus was causing thousands of people in China to become ill, it became apparent that this would be more than a simple illness of concern only to health experts and residents of the most affected areas. This virus is much more, for many more."", ""China's decision to put nearly 60 million people under lockdown in and around Wuhan is unprecedented and highly controversial. When a local doctor, Li Wenliang, tried to raise the alarm in December, authorities detained him and accused him of spreading rumors. He died of the virus last week. Then a citizen journalist, Chen Qiushi, providing critical reporting from Wuhan, suddenly disappeared. Another citizen journalist was reportedly arrested on Monday amid reports of a growing number of arrests for criticism of the government's handling of the crisis."", 
""But it's not just China's response that has raised questions. Whenever a contagion becomes so serious that the word \""quarantine\"" becomes part of the discussions, the ethical cost of such prevention casts a shadow on every decision."", ""Quarantine is a frontal assault on freedom. It literally deprives individuals of their liberties for the sake of the larger community, raising countless difficult questions."", ""How much power should authorities have over the daily lives of individuals? How much should individuals sacrifice for the sake of the community? How far should the state go in enforcing restrictions? Should people go to jail for violating a confinement to which they are forced because of no fault of their own?  What to do when someone becomes ill on a ship holding thousands of healthy passengers? If you decide to keep the passengers on board, who will bring their food? How will they be protected?"", 
""The cruise industry is undoubtedly taking a financial hit with vessels in the news and passengers who were supposed to be enjoying a trip of a lifetime enduring prolonged confinement."", ""As a result, some companies are responding with measures that appear driven more by prejudice than prevention. Royal Caribbean has announced that it will -- reasonably -- deny boarding to anyone who traveled through China in the past two weeks. Less reasonably, it was for a time barring any holder of passports from China, Hong Kong or Macau, regardless of whether they had set foot in those locations."", 
""The virus, and the intensive media attention it is receiving, have spurred an outbreak of fear and prejudice and, quite predictably, an avalanche of bigotry in many countries, and a torrent of conspiracy theories, including from government officials who should know better."", ""The knee jerk reaction is to lock away anyone who might have become infected and push away anyone perceived, however unfairly, to pose a risk."", ""The problem of prejudice is so severe that two months into the crisis public health authorities had not been able to come up with a name for the virus. The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses is struggling with the challenge. To prevent the stigma, the naming committee wants to avoid a name that includes a geographical location, a culture, industry, name, animal or food. Without an officially recognized name, many call it the Wuhan virus, while authorities temporarily went with Novel Coronavirus or NcV-2019. Finally on Tuesday, with more than 42,000 cases diagnosed, the WHO named it \""COVID-19.\"""", 
""It is a virus that is having an impact that goes beyond public health. It will not only reverberate across the global economic and political landscape, but it is already the source of moral and ethical questions."", ""Warehousing passengers and crew on a ship is not a responsible solution. Workers who did not sign up for quarantine duty should be let off the ship, moved along with the rest of those on board to a more suitable facility."

While the resulting disease, Covid-19, is not as fatal on a case-by-case basis, its greater spread has already led to more deaths than its related coronaviruses."", 
""The new study examined data from 72,314 patients, 44,672 of which were confirmed cases of the virus (61.8%), along with 10,567 clinically diagnosed cases (14.6%) and 16,186 suspected cases (22.4%). An additional 889 cases examined did not show any symptoms."", ""\""Clinically diagnosed cases,\"" are patients who demonstrate all the symptoms of Covid-19 but have either not been able to get a test or are believed to have falsely tested negative."", ""Of the 44,672 confirmed cases, the Chinese CDC said there were 1,023 deaths, a crude mortality rate of 2.3%, which is in line with other studies and projections. By comparison, SARS had a mortality rate of 9.6% during the 2003 outbreak, while MERS has a case fatality of 35%. Seasonal influenza, which is highly contagious and effects tens of millions of people, has a mortality rate of around 0.1%, according to the most recent estimates from the US Centers for Disease Control."", 
""International experts have cautioned that early numbers may not tell the whole story. Case fatality rates may come down as officials discover milder cases who don't seek medical care."", ""\""My sense and the sense of many of my colleagues, is that the ultimate case fatality rate ... is less than 2%,\"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN's Jim Sciutto on \""New Day\"" Tuesday. \""What is likely not getting counted is a large number of people who are either asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic, so the denominator of your equation is likely much much larger.\"""", 
""\""So I would think at tops it's 2% and it likely will go down when all the counting gets done to 1% or less. That's still considerable if you look at the possibility that you're dealing with a global pandemic,\"" he added."", """", ""Because the Covid-19 virus has infected far more people than the viruses that caused SARS and MERS, the number of people who have died from it so far has already overtaken both viruses. The SARS outbreak claimed the lives of 774 people, while MERS has killed at least 828 people since 2012."", 
""Even so, flu has led to far more deaths than all of these viruses combined -- killing tens of thousands of people in the US each year -- due to its massive spread."", ""The latest death toll from Covid-19 is over 1,800, all but five of which occurred in mainland China, where the worst of the outbreak is centered."", ""Many of those deaths have been among older people and those with preexisting conditions that make them more susceptible to serious illness from viral infections. The Chinese CDC study found that among patients aged 80 and above, the crude fatality rate is 14.8%. Among those with pre-existing conditions, those with cardiovascular disease were found to be most at risk, with a fatality rate of 10.5%."",

""Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses common among animals. In rare cases, they are what scientists call zoonotic, meaning they can be transmitted from animals to humans, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."", ""Officials do not know what animal may have caused the current outbreak of novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China. But previously, studies have suggested that people were infected with the coronavirus MERS, or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, after coming in contact with camels, and scientists have suspected that civet cats were to blame for SARS, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome."", 
""These human coronaviruses, such as SARS and MERS, have been found to persist on inanimate surfaces -- including metal, glass or plastic surfaces -- for as long as nine days if that surface had not been disinfected, according to research published earlier this month in The Journal of Hospital Infection."", ""Cleaning with common household products can make a difference, according to the research, which also found that human coronaviruses \""can be efficiently inactivated by surface disinfection procedures with 62-71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite\"" or bleach within one minute."", 
""The new research involved analyzing 22 previously published studies on coronaviruses, which researchers hope can help provide insight into the novel coronavirus."", ""\""Based on the current available data, I would primarily rely on the data from SARS coronavirus, which is the closest relative to the novel coronavirus -- with 80% sequence similarity -- among the coronaviruses tested. For SARS coronavirus, the range of persistence on surfaces was less than five minutes to nine days,\"" said Dr. Charles Chiu, an infectious disease professor at the University of California, San Francisco, and director of the USCF-Abbott Viral Diagnostics and Discovery Center, who was not involved in the new study."", 
""\""However, it is very difficult to extrapolate these findings to the novel coronavirus due to the different strains, viral titers and environmental conditions that were tested in the various studies and the lack of data on the novel coronavirus itself,\"" he said. \""More research using cultures of the novel coronavirus are needed to establish the duration that it can survive on surfaces.\"""", ""The CDC has noted that coronaviruses are thought to spread most often by respiratory droplets, such as droplets in a cough or sneeze, and coronaviruses in general have \""poor survivability\"" on surfaces -- but there is still much to learn about the novel coronavirus disease, named COVID-19."", 
""\""It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads,\"" according to the CDC's website."", ""While there are some similarities between other coronaviruses and the novel coronavirus, there are some differences emerging, too."", ""\""It also appears that COVID-19 is not as deadly as other coronaviruses, including SARS and MERS,\"" Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, said during a media briefing with reporters Monday."", 
""\""More than 80% of patients have mild disease and will recover. In about 14% of cases, the virus causes severe diseases including pneumonia and shortness of breath.

We see relatively few cases among children. More research is needed to understand why.\"""", ""While the novel coronavirus fatality rate is lower than for SARS and MERS, it still seems to be comparable to the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, Neil Ferguson, professor of mathematical biology at Imperial College London, said in January."", 
""\""It is a significant concern, globally,\"" Ferguson said, noting that we don't yet fully understand the severity."", ""Ferguson said he believes the fatality rate is likely to be lower because of an \""iceberg\"" of milder cases that have not yet been identified, but he highlights that novel viruses spread much more quickly through a population."", ""\""Remain informed, but do not panic,\"" Chiu said."", ""If you do have concerns, \""my recommendations would be frequent hand-washing, avoiding contact with people who are sick, follow home quarantine recommendations according to the latest public health agency guidelines if you have recently traveled from China or were in contact with a known or suspected infected patient,\"" he said."",

Tom Cotton isn't an infectious disease expert."", ""Which is why it's odd that the Arkansas Republican decided to wildly speculate about the origins of the novel coronavirus during an appearance on Fox News this past Sunday. Asked by anchor Maria Bartiromo \""why do these diseases keep coming out of China,\"" Cotton responded:"", ""\""This virus did not originate in the Wuhan animal market. Several of the original cases did not have any contact with that food market. We don't know where it originated ... we also know that just a few miles away from that food market is China's only Bio Safety level 4 super laboratory that researches human infectious diseases. We don't have evidence that this disease originated there ... but we at least have to ask the question.\"""", 
""So, in short, what Cotton is suggesting is that either the virus is the result of an experiment gone bad or a purposeful release of a bio-weapon."", ""BIG news, right? Except that there's no actual evidence to back up Cotton's claim. Here's what CNN fact checker Tara Subramaniam wrote about Cotton's claim:"", ""\""Regarding Cotton's hypothesis that the virus originated in connection with a lab, Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said 'I have seen no one provide any solid information to support that theory. I think at this point you can draw a line through it and say that didn't happen.'"", 
""\""'Everyone with whom I've spoken, or whom I've read, thinks that it has come from a natural source, as did the SARS virus, as did the MERS virus. Both of those were also coronaviruses in animal populations that jumped to the human species in the natural environment,' Schaffner said. 'By now scientists all over the world have looked at this virus and nothing nefarious has come up.'\"""", ""So, yeah. Cotton did take to Twitter after his appearance to clarify that he wasn't directly suggesting coronavirus was some sort of bio-weapon gone wrong -- merely suggesting that it was one of four possible origins."", 
""Which is more responsible! But doesn't change the fact that on TV -- which has a lot more viewers than Cotton's Twitter feed! -- he floated a totally evidence-free conspiracy theory about the disease."", ""This is the height of irresponsibility from a public official. There is already a massive amount of fear -- and misinformation -- in the public about the novel coronavirus. Why add to it by suggesting, without evidence, that this could actually be a Chinese bio-weapon?"", ""Cotton obviously knows better. Not only does he have a sterling academic resume (Harvard, Harvard Law) but he also spent time in the military before being elected to the House and Senate. He knows exactly why speculation like this makes things worse, not better."", 
""But he also is living -- as we all are -- in a sort of post-truth world, one if not created, then pushed by President Donald Trump. Trump's candidacy was born in a conspiracy theory (former President Barack Obama wasn't actually born in the United States) and he has embraced any number of conspiracy theories in his days as President. (Millions of illegal votes were cast in the 2016 election, Obama ordered the phones at Trump Tower wiretapped, etc.)"", ""Trump has mainstreamed conspiracy theories and convinced lots and lots of people they are true with much the same tactic Cotton used on Sunday, which amounts to this: I am not saying this is true, I am just saying people are talking about it and we owe it to ourselves to ask the question."", 
""But simply because Trump has made this sort of stuff commonplace doesn't mean it's OK. It isn't. After all, there's a difference between a random post on some Reddit message board and a US senator spinning conspiracy theories on national TV. Or at least, there should be."

If someone doesn't have a fever, it seems like they're fine -- right?"", ""Not so fast."", """", ""While the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has screened more than 30,000 passengers in the past month, not a single US coronavirus case has been caught by airport temperature checks, according to a CNN investigation."", 
""There has long been debate about the usefulness of airport temperature checks, but this recent experience at US airports, plus a new European study, seem to point in the direction that they don't work."", ""Earlier this month, British researchers published a study showing that temperature checks will fail to detect a coronavirus infection nearly half the time."", ""At least one country has found airport temperature checks so unhelpful that it decided not to do them during the novel coronavirus outbreak. Israel used them in previous years for Ebola, SARS and H1N1, but found that they didn't work."", 
""\""It is ineffective and inefficient,\"" said Dr. Itamar Grotto, associate director general of Israel's Ministry of Health."", ""Grotto said the problem is that a normal temperature gives \""false assurance.\"" Passengers with normal temperatures could still be in the incubation period, which means they're infected, but have yet to develop a fever."", ""In addition, a small number of patients with the novel coronavirus don't have fever, according to published studies."", ""Some experts are convinced that for these reasons, temperature checks at airports are useless."", 
""\""I don't think airport temperature checks have any major effect on stopping or even slowing down transmission,\"" said Michael Osterholm, an epidemiologist and professor at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health. \""We just don't have any good data to support that.\"""", ""Since mid-January, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been employing temperature checks at selected airports, at first on people flying in from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the outbreak, and now on all passengers who've been anywhere in mainland China in the past 14 days."", 
""The temperature checks are part of an overall screening effort that includes giving passengers cards telling them to watch out for fever, cough and trouble breathing, all symptoms of the novel coronavirus disease, also called COVID-19."", ""\""Finding sick people who are at risk for COVID-19, alerting asymptomatic travelers who may develop COVID-19 symptoms after arrival, and rapidly responding to any suspect COVID-19 illness, we can most effectively protect the health and safety of the American public,\"" said Dr. Martin Cetron, director of CDC's Division of Global Migration and Quarantine."", 
""Some experts say it's that card -- a simple card listing symptoms in English and Chinese -- that holds the key to detecting coronavirus infection -- not a thermometer."", """", ""Temperature checks for US coronavirus cases"", ""CNN reviewed statements by local, state and federal health officials, and emailed and spoke with officials, to determine how many people eventually diagnosed with coronavirus went through airport temperature checks."", ""Ten passengers flew into US airports on commercial airliners and were later diagnosed with coronavirus."", 
""CNN's investigation shows that four of those 10 passengers went through temperature checks and were found not to have a fever or any other symptoms of the virus. Two of those passengers flew into Los Angeles International Airport and two flew into San Francisco International Airport."", ""Previously, a CDC spokesperson had told CNN that two of the passengers were symptomatic during flight, but the spokesperson later said they were asymptomatic while flying."", ""Another 4 out of the 10 passengers were not screened because they flew into airports that did not have screening at the time. Those cases are in Illinois, Washington state, Massachusetts and California."", 
""It's unclear whether the final two passengers went through temperature checks because health officials at the CDC and in Wisconsin and Arizona refused to say when asked by CNN."", ""When human nature gets in the way"", ""There's another reason why airport temperature checks don't always work: human nature."", ""Let's say someone's on a long-haul flight to the United States and starts to have a scratchy throat or feel tired or achy. The passenger might attribute those feelings to jet lag or dry air on the plane. Maybe they would take a pain relief medicine such as Advil or Tylenol and try to forget about it."", 
""\""That's just human nature,\"" said Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota."", ""When the person lands, they might not have a fever because, in addition to relieving pain, Advil and Tylenol also treat fever."", ""\""That's why for this type of screening, there's no evidence it has any measurable impact on the ultimate course of the outbreak,\"" Osterholm said."", ""What does work"", ""While airport temperature checks haven't caught any coronavirus cases, the information cards have helped catch US cases of the virus at least twice."", 
""On January 24, a man flew into San Francisco \""and was found to be totally healthy and asymptomatic,\"" according to Dr. Martin Fenstersheib, interim health officer for San Benito County, California."", ""As part of the screening routine, the passenger was given a card -- technically called a Travel Health Alert Notice -- that explained he should take his temperature twice a day and call his local health department if he developed a fever or cough or had difficulty breathing."", ""The next day, the man had symptoms."", 
""\""So he looked back at [the card] and said, 'Oh, we need to stay at home, per this information, and contact our local health department,' which they did. So it's good that they were screened, and he abided by that information, so that's good,\"" Fenstersheib said at a press conference."", ""In the other case, a man flew from Wuhan to the Los Angeles airport in mid-January, where he was screened and did not have a fever or other symptoms of coronavirus. He was given the traveler alert card and flew immediately to Mexico."", 
""After a few days in Mexico, the man had a family emergency in China and flew back to the Los Angeles airport with plans to immediately board a flight to Wuhan. But at the Los Angeles airport he felt ill, and while wearing a mask, he presented himself to health officials there."", ""\""He had the card and he remembered,\"" a health official told CNN."", ""US travel restrictions to stop the spread of coronavirus"", ""The CDC has taken other steps to prevent the spread of coronavirus."", ""On February 3, the CDC announced that most foreign nationals who've been in China in the past 14 days will be barred from entering the United States."", 
"""", ""According to the new policy, US citizens, lawful permanent residents and their families who have been in China in the past 14 days will be allowed to enter the United States only through one of the 11 airports that have health screenings."", ""Those 11 airports include the San Francisco and Los Angeles airports as well as John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York; Chicago O'Hare International Airport, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, Detroit Metropolitan Airport, Daniel K. Inouye International Airport in Honolulu, Washington Dulles International Airport, Newark Liberty International Airport, and Dallas Fort Worth International Airport."", 
""After screening, passengers who are found to be symptomatic for coronavirus will receive further medical evaluation."", ""Passengers who are asymptomatic are handled differently depending on their travel history. If they've been in Hubei province in the past 14 days, they're not allowed to continue their travels, and must be quarantined at a location near the airport for 14 days."", ""If they've been elsewhere in mainland China, they can continue their travels and are asked to stay home as much as possible and monitor their health."", 
""The lesson of Ebola"", ""On September 19, 2014, Thomas Eric Duncan, a Liberian citizen, flew to the US to visit family. By official accounts, he left Liberia a healthy man."", ""Days later, he fell ill and went to an emergency room in Dallas, Texas. Doctors there missed his Ebola infection, and later he was admitted to that hospital, where he subsequently infected two nurses and then died."", """", ""Five years later, that's exactly the scenario the CDC wants to avoid with the new coronavirus."", ""To that end, the CDC has put out guidance to doctors on how to handle possible coronavirus infections, and to hospitals on infection control for the new virus."", 
""\""They're doing a great job at this,\"" said Osterholm, the epidemiologist in Minnesota."", ""These are the measures -- information to travelers, doctors and hospitals -- that can help stop the outbreak, Osterholm said, and less so the temperature screening."", ""\""But everybody around the world is doing it, so I guess if we didn't do it, we would look like we were being derelict in our duty,\"" he said."", """

There is still a lot unknown about the virus, which has infected more than 71,000 people globally and killed 1,775, the majority in China -- but it appears to survive for at least several hours on surfaces, according to the World Health Organization."", 
""This is why buildings in affected areas are regularly disinfecting elevator buttons, door handles, and other commonly-touched surfaces -- and why people are worried about cash, which changes hands multiple times a day."", ""All Chinese banks must now literally launder their cash, disinfecting it with ultraviolet light and high temperatures, then storing it for seven to 14 days before releasing it to customers, said the central Chinese government in a press release Saturday."", """", ""Cash that comes from high-risk infection areas, like hospitals and wet markets, will be \""specially treated\"" and sent back to the central bank instead of being recirculated."", 
""And in the central bank's Guangzhou branch, these high-risk banknotes may be destroyed instead of merely disinfected, according to state-run tabloid Global Times."", ""To make up for the supply, the bank will issue large amounts of new, uninfected cash; in January, the bank allocated 4 billion yuan (about $573.5 million) in new banknotes to Wuhan, the Chinese city where the outbreak began, said the government press release."", ""Other measures includes suspending physical cash transfers between hard-hit provinces, to limit the possibility of virus transmission during the cash's transit."", 
""It's unclear how \""infected\"" cash in China may actually be -- the virus likely dies after a few hours on surfaces, especially if it's been killed with disinfectant. And most people in urban centers don't use cash anyway -- mobile payment apps are near-ubiquitous."", """", ""But as previous studies have found, money can be incredibly dirty. Each dollar, passed person to person, samples a bit of the environment it comes from, and passes those bits to the next person."", ""The list of things found on US dollar bills includes DNA from our pets, traces of drugs, and bacteria and viruses, according to a 2017 study in New York."", 
""That doesn't mean cash is actually dangerous for our health; disease transmission linked to money is rare, and no major disease outbreaks have started from our ATMs. But with new cases being reported every day in China, the country's officials are taking no chances."", ""The new measures indicate \""the financial system's full support in fighting the virus and resuming production,\"" the government press release said."", ""China struggles to contain coronavirus"", ""Since the outbreak began in Wuhan in December, it has spread to 28 countries and territories, sparking travel restrictions and emergency measures worldwide."", 
""But mainland China remains the hardest hit. Of the 1,775 coronavirus deaths worldwide, only five occurred outside of mainland China. And of the 71,319 cases worldwide, 70,548 are in mainland China."", ""To limit the spread of the virus, Chinese authorities have implemented a number of other drastic measures including placing 60 million people under full or partial lockdown. People aren't just afraid to touch money -- just going outside risks infection, so many have stayed at home for the past few weeks, only venturing out to buy groceries."", 
""Even when they do go out, they wrap themselves in protective plastic; travelers at a Beijing train station this week were seen wearing disposable plastic gloves, shower caps, full-face plastic visors, and even full-body plastic ponchos."", """", ""The lockdowns and halt in business have also taken a toll on the Chinese economy, with some warning that the outbreak could cost China $62 billion in lost growth. Experts warn that if businesses shut down entirely, unable to survive the prolonged suspensions, it could result in mass layoffs, unemployment, and housing foreclosures."", 
""And so, millions of people are beginning to resume work -- in the safety of their apartments, in what may be the world's biggest work-from-home experiment."", ""Meanwhile, Chinese and international experts continue working together to learn more about the virus and contain its spread. On Sunday, a team of WHO and international experts arrived in Beijing for a joint mission with their Chinese counterparts, to analyze data and determine next steps for both China and the world."

But once his case was confirmed, he stopped worrying. \""I knew from this point, there's no other choice but to receive treatment,\"" Zhang added."", ""Zhang was fortunate to receive a diagnosis. There are reports in parts of China that a shortage of testing kits and inaccurate results are leading to long delays in the diagnosis and treatment of coronavirus patients."", 
""As of Monday, there were more than 71,000 cases of the disease globally and more than 1,700  deaths -- the vast majority of which have occurred in Hubei province, the central region of China where the virus was first detected."", ""But as the death toll rises, so does the tally of those who have survived."", ""Chinese state-run media has been heavily publicizing the virus-free former patients, showing footage of them receiving flowers and leaving hospital. Zhang is one of more than 10,000 people to have recovered from coronavirus after receiving an official diagnosis."", 
""Family infected"", ""Zhang is currently undergoing a 14-day quarantine in a government-assigned hotel in the city of Chongqing, where he had traveled to with his wife's parents for the Lunar New Year."", ""He arrived in the city from Wuhan on January 22 with his wife and parents-in-law. The next day, his father-in-law went to hospital because he had developed a cough."", ""\""We had strongly asked for a nasopharyngeal swab test ... because we felt that all his symptoms were similar (to that of coronavirus),\"" Zhang said. But the county hospital refused to perform the test."", 
""A few days later, his wife came down with a fever. On January 30, a nasopharyngeal swab test showed both she and her father had been infected by the novel coronavirus, officially called Covid-19. The next day, Zhang and his mother-in-law were given nasal swab tests as well. The whole family had been infected."", ""\""Had we done the nasopharyngeal swab tests earlier, maybe not all four of us in the family would be infected,\"" Zhang said."", ""The family was diagnosed at a county hospital that wasn't able to treat them. \""We were all transferred to a higher-level hospital in the city ... the ambulance collected us directly from the county hospital and took us to the city hospital. Point to point. There was no stopover,\"" he said."", 
""During his treatment, Zhang said he was constantly asking doctors about the drugs he was being given. He researched online how his treatment compared to that of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients in 2003, to ensure he wasn't taking medication with long-term side effects."", ""On February 9, after being discharged from hospital, Zhang was sent to quarantine. He was told almost all his personal belongings, including clothes, books and other items, would have to be destroyed."", ""So far only Zhang and his wife's father have recovered. His wife and her mother are still in hospital."", 
""Aware of the negative stigma surrounding people who have been infected by the coronavirus, Zhang asked to use a pseudonym in his interviews with CNN."", ""Even the survivors who are shown on Chinese state-run broadcasters have their faces blurred, as the government understands the social isolation and discrimination a diagnosis can bring."", ""Still, in many ways, Zhang was lucky. As a young, fit man who plays basketball and has no pre-existing conditions, his chances of surviving the coronavirus appeared to be high."", 
""\""(After I was diagnosed) I checked the death numbers published at that time. I found most people who died were senior citizens, many of whom had other conditions. And for me personally, I don't have any other diseases,\"" he said."", ""'I just treated it as a normal cold'"", ""Quarantined in a hotel in Wuhan, 21-year-old Tiger Ye is waiting for a negative result on his last test before he can go home."", ""He needs four negative tests before he is declared clear."", ""Like Zhang, Ye has recovered from the deadly novel coronavirus. He also asked to use a pseudonym for fear of repercussions from speaking out."", 
""Zhang isn't clear how he was infected, but Ye said he likely got infected while studying Japanese at a language school not far from the Wuhan seafood market where the coronavirus is believed to have originated."", ""\""On January 17, while attending school, I felt a little sick and sore. (But) I just treated it as a normal cold and took some medicine,\"" he said. Within a few days, Ye started to lose his appetite and by January 21, he was so unwell he couldn't finish his lunch."", ""He took a taxi to one major hospital, but found it packed with anxious people. \""It was a real mess. There was a lot of people, nurses and doctors in the fever clinic,\"" he said. \""I saw the people and checked the map (for another hospital).\"""", 
""After looking at a map, he identified a smaller hospital and headed there. He was sent away with a prescription but without a proper diagnosis."", ""Ye's condition kept getting worse and by January 26 he had a \""crazy cough\"" and a high fever. At the height of his illness, Ye said he \""felt cold, but his body was hot,\"" with a temperature above 39 degrees Celsius (102 degrees Fahrenheit). He suffered from stomach pain, vomiting and diarrhea."", ""After visiting hospital again, he couldn't get a taxi home as Wuhan was now under lockdown, so his father had to come and pick him up in their car. \""My dad told me I needed to be in quarantine for about 14 days,\"" he said."", 
""Eventually, Ye returned to hospital. There he was officially diagnosed with the virus and given medication usually used for treating HIV -- an experimental treatment that while uncommon has been provided in China and other countries."", ""Ye began to recover quickly and on February 9, he was put into a hotel to be quarantined. He had never officially been hospitalized."", ""\""When I was at my hardest point, I thought 'will I die?' But I just had to face this disease and fight it,\"" he said."", ""Not every survivor has found having the disease a difficult experience. Speaking at a press conference arranged by the Chinese government on Friday, 31-year-old IT worker Li said that she had only minor symptoms and felt safe once she was  hospitalized."", 
""\""Everyone shouldn't be afraid of this disease, if anyone has got it, you should trust the country, trust the hospital and trust the doctors,\"" she told journalists. \""So please go to the hospital for examination as soon as possible when you got it. We can definitely defeat the disease.\"""", ""Xu Bin, a doctor in Beijing Youan Hospital, said that medics were using a mixture of anti-virus medication and Traditional Chinese Medicine to help patients recover. Doctors were protecting themselves from the virus by wearing hazmat suits, along with another layer of protective clothes and gloves, and N95 face masks."", 
""For patients like Zhang and Ye, the uncertainty around the virus is one of the worst parts of being infected. Even after they have recovered, Zhang said he had heard stories about \""negative (patients) turning positive again.\"""", ""\""I watched the news and know there's that possibility. I don't know if that would happen to me and I'm a bit worried about it, because there still isn't clear information about this disease. You can't really say someone is completely cured,\"" he said."

We don't yet know how severe it will be, nor do we know if the virus will spread to all continents, but it's already spreading widely in China, South Korea, Italy, Iran and elsewhere -- and thousands of undetected and infectious patients have been and continue to travel around the world."", ""This is unprecedented. Other than influenza, no other respiratory virus has been tracked from emergence to continuous global spread. The last moderately severe influenza pandemics were in 1957 and 1968; each killed more than a million people around the world. Although we are far more prepared than in the past, we are also far more interconnected, and many more people today have chronic health problems that make viral infections particularly dangerous."", 
""Based on extensive planning for an influenza pandemic by many national and international experts, we must do eight things -- some immediately and some in the coming months -- as we shift from the initiation phase of the pandemic to the acceleration stage:"", ""Find out more about how Covid-19 spreads, how deadly it is and what we can do to reduce its harms. As many as half of people with infection have no symptoms, and at least 80% of those who do feel ill have only mild symptoms. In Wuhan, China, the reported proportion of diagnosed patients who die is now 3%. That's a substantial over-estimate; many patients weren't tested, many infected people don't have symptoms and hospitals were overwhelmed. The proportion could be as low as less than 1 in 1,000 -- 30 times lower -- and is unlikely to be more than 1 in 100. The actual rate makes a huge difference, not only to patients but also to decisions about interventions.Reduce the number of people who get infected. If it turns out that many of those infected become severely ill, this would justify drastic measures such as closing or curtailing hours of schools, limiting public gatherings and reducing social contact. The lower the risk of death from infection, the less sense it makes to take these and other actions that disrupt social and economic stability. In any case, spread can be minimized by quickly isolating those who are ill, cleaning potentially contaminated surfaces often and changing common routines. We need to get serious about little things that make a big difference: washing hands, covering coughs and, if we're sick, staying home or wearing a mask when we go out. Let's stop shaking hands for a while. I prefer the traditional Southeast Asian hands-together namaste greeting, although the elbow bump is fun.Protect health care workers. Even before Covid-19, far too many health workers and patients got infections in health care facilities. We need fast and drastic improvements in triage, treatment, cleaning and overall infection prevention. A shortage of medical masks is likely; we need to ensure health care workers have enough, as should household members caring for sick relatives and people who are ill and need to go outside. For health care workers, newer, longer-lasting technologies such as elastomeric and positive air pressure respirators could address an otherwise inevitable shortage of medical masks.Improve medical care and prevention of Covid-19. A vaccine is at least a year away, and success is uncertain. Treatments that hold promise need to be evaluated rigorously. In a moderately severe pandemic, there wouldn't be enough ventilators to support patients' breathing. Health facilities and health departments in the United States can prepare for a worst-case scenario by preparing -- with training, equipment, and detailed operational plans -- for a surge in the number of patients who seek care and for the subset of those who need to be mechanically ventilated, including through ventilators available from the Strategic National Stockpile.Protect health services. During the 2014-2016 Ebola epidemic in West Africa, more people died because of disruptions of day-to-day health care than died from Ebola. Telemedicine needs to become much more accessible, and people with chronic conditions should receive three months of medications whenever possible, in case there are supply disruptions. Routine vaccinations and other preventive services need to be preserved.Support social needs. Patients and their families will need support, especially those who are isolated and less familiar with virtual or delivery services. Continuing to support individuals and groups ranging from community centers to nursing homes will require detailed plans.Protect economic stability. Continuing to plan, teach, learn and work will reduce disruption. Businesses need to be ready to maximize telecommuting, increase cross-training and operate with as many as 40% of their staff ill or quarantined. Mission-critical enterprises need practical plans to continue to operate.Invest in public health. It will cost about $1 a person per year for at least a decade to build the health protection systems needed in Africa and Asia. That's a lot of money -- about $25 billion -- but a tiny fraction of what a preventable epidemic such as this one can cost. (SARS cost $40 billion; estimates for the potential cost of Covid-19 exceed $1 trillion.)"", 
""The virus and appropriate interventions will behave differently in high-resource than in low-resource areas, depending on crowding, capacity for diagnosis and treatment, and ability to reduce spread. We don't yet know if Covid-19 will result in thousands, hundreds of thousands, or millions of deaths."", ""Above all, we must do no harm. We don't shut schools every year for seasonal influenza, and we didn't shut them for the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, for good reason: The severity level didn't merit it. If the virus did emerge from the wet market selling exotic animals for food in Wuhan, then China's failure to close such markets after SARS is the fundamental cause of this outbreak."", 
""On the other hand, China's extraordinary cordon of Hubei province and other areas bought the world at least a month of lead time to prepare. The past week's news means that the world must take these steps, and fast, to limit the health, social and economic harms of the COVID-19 pandemic."

The short answer: highly unlikely."", ""While coronavirus can exist on surfaces for days, conditions such as temperature and humidity must be favorable. Covid-19 is primarily spread through close contact with someone who is infected."", 
""During a viral pandemic, we are often our own worst enemies."", ""Point in fact: We touch our face with our hands, including our nose, eyes, and mouth -- areas with mucous membranes, an average of 15 to 23 times an hour. Much of the time, we don't even realize we are doing it. We also touch door handles, subway poles, handrails, saltshakers, other people's hands and grocery carts. We inhale tiny droplets that come from someone sneezing or coughing nearby."", ""The good news? The steps you can take to protect yourself against the extremely low chance that you might get exposed to coronavirus in the US will also guard against the widespread outbreak we are actually experiencing here -- seasonal influenza."", 
""While at least 60 cases of Covid-19 have been confirmed in the US, no one has died of it here, while this year's influenza has infected at least 29 million in the US and killed about 16,000 so far."", ""Covid-19 is spreading easily and sustainably in the Hubei province and other parts of China, and has been confirmed in more than two dozen other countries. While the global death toll has so far topped 2,700, it's good to remember that more than 80% of the Covid-19 cases have been mild, requiring little to no medical intervention, and it is much less deadly than severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which are also coronaviruses."", 
""Here is the best advice I can give you, to avoid any virus and flu: Be intentionally hygienic in public and during interactions with others. Hand hygiene is a cornerstone of infection prevention. Effective hand hygiene requires appropriate duration and thoroughness, which should be a goal each time our hands are cleaned."", ""Use soap and water for the amount of time it takes to sing the \""Happy Birthday\"" song, or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. In a study we conducted on hand hygiene, the most common areas missed by hand washers were thumbs, wrists, and in between fingers."", 
""When our clinical team was caring for four patients with the deadly Ebola virus disease in Emory University Hospital's isolation unit five years ago, our protocol for donning (putting on) and doffing (taking off) our personal protective equipment (PPE) -- disposable scrubs, a Tyvek suit, shoe booties, two pairs of gloves, apron, respirator, and hood -- was a matter of life and death."", ""During simulations, we determined that the two points of highest risk for self-contamination were insufficient hand hygiene and during removal of the powered air purifying respirator. In resource-scarce areas where Ebola outbreaks have occurred, the danger to health care workers is even more pervasive."", 
""Our team was successful at safeguarding our well-being because we monitored each other. Each time we put on or took off our PPE to enter or leave the isolation unit, a colleague with a checklist was watching to make sure we didn't miss a step."", ""Protection of health care workers is vital with Covid-19 as well: so far, more than 1,700 health care workers in China have been infected and six have died. That is worrisome. We don't want to lose health care workers as happened in Sierra Leone and Liberia with Ebola, where there are monuments to the hundreds of health care workers who died there."", 
""In the real world, it would be unrealistic to walk around wearing protective clothing and respirators. But there are lessons we learned that can apply to any situation."", ""For instance, my family just flew from Michigan to Atlanta, and asked me, what do we do on the plane? Should we wear a mask? My answer -- do what you should do every time: Don't touch surfaces and then touch your face. It doesn't have to be in a fearful or compulsive way -- just be aware and mindful of protecting yourself."", ""A mask that you have never used before and wear all day long, that gets damp, is not going to help you. You may touch it a lot because it is uncomfortable, lowering its effectiveness."", 
""Quite simply, good hand hygiene and face hygiene will protect you from a lot of illnesses, including Covid-19."", ""Risk is dependent on exposure. Some people will have an increased risk of infection, such as health care workers caring for patients with Covid-19 and other close contacts. For the general public in the US, who are unlikely to be exposed to this virus, the immediate health risk from Covid-19 is considered low at this time."", ""My risk, being an infectious disease physician, is slightly increased, since I see individuals with respiratory viruses.  But my best defense is the same as yours: be aware of potential exposure and mitigate it, be mindful of what you touch, and be sure to wash your hands well and often."""

""\""We are asking the American public to work with us to prepare in the expectation that this could be bad.\"""", ""The CDC has been referring to guidance on how to deal with flu pandemics, in a document called \""Community Mitigation Guidelines to Prevent Pandemic Influenza United States 2017.\"" It's the \""blueprint\"" for community interventions, and the agency is adjusting its recommendations to the specific circumstances of the coronavirus outbreak, officials said."", ""The document draws from the findings of nearly 200 journal articles written between 1990 and 2016, and it includes a summary of lessons learned from the response to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, which killed hundreds of thousands globally."",

""\""It's the perfect time for businesses, health care systems, universities and schools to look at their pandemic preparedness plans, dust them off and make sure that they're ready.\"""", ""Some schools and social events could shut down"", ""Widespread transmission of the coronavirus could impact schools, child care centers, colleges and group events, such as concerts, festivals, and sporting events, according to the CDC's 2017 document."", ""For instance, the document notes that \""social distancing measures\"" for schools, workplaces and gatherings \""can reduce virus transmission by decreasing the frequency and duration of social contact among persons of all ages.\"""", 
""In schools, that could involve dividing classes into smaller groups of students and rearranging desks so students are spaced at least 3 feet from each other in a classroom, according to the document. That is, if the school remains open."", ""CDC might recommend the use of coordinated school closures during severe pandemics. More than 100 schools closed in 2009 in response to the H1N1 flu pandemic."", """", ""Closing or canceling schools in response to public health concerns are decisions that districts typically have to grapple with and are already experienced in making."", 
""\""Even in my own state of Maine, schools have in recent weeks and months had to close for influenza. During the H1N1 crisis many years ago, schools were also closed then,\"" recalled Dr. Nirav Shah, director of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention and a member of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials."", ""For the novel coronavirus, \""one of the questions that is scientifically out there that will govern or drive how school closures are calculated is to what extent children themselves carry or transmit this virus,\"" Shah said. \""Scientifically we need to have a better understanding of to what extent children are carriers or transmitters of the virus -- the point of that is, it's premature right now based on the science to make uniform claims about what school closures may look like.\"""", 
"""", ""Messonnier said on Tuesday that she talked to her family and told them, while they are not at risk right now, they should have a plan in case their lives are significantly impacted. She said she even called the children's school district to find out what would happen if schools needed to close."", ""\""The data over the last week, and the spread in other countries, has certainly raised our level of concern and raised our level of expectation\"" of community spread, she said."", ""The CDC still doesn't know what that will look like, she added. Community spread could be reasonably mild or very severe."", 
""You might be urged to work from home"", ""The CDC has posted guidance on its website to help businesses and employers make decisions on work-from-home policies or flexible sick leave if there is significant spread of the coronavirus across the country."", ""Such guidance also includes how to respond if an employee gets sick."", """", ""The 2017 document noted that \""social distancing measures that reduce face-to-face contact in workplaces might include offering telework and remote meeting options. Flexible sick leave policies should be implemented to encourage workers to stay home if needed.\"""", 
""Also according to the document, \""CDC recommends environmental surface cleaning measures in all settings, including homes, schools, and workplaces, to remove influenza viruses from frequently touched surfaces and objects.\"""", ""Yet overall, \""what community spread looks like in the United States will vary greatly community by community. It might vary by time, it might vary by place,\"" Shah said."", ""\""Although we believe, according to the US CDC, that community spread is likely in the United States, the magnitude of that possibility as well as how it actually plays out, that will vary greatly between Washington state, Florida, Maine and any other state,\"" he said, adding because of that, \""there will not be a one-size-fits-all approach here.\"""",

Currently, there is no vaccine to protect against the coronavirus and no medications have been approved, yet, to treat it."", 
""\""What this looks like, again, will vary greatly community by community, city by city, state by state,\"" Shah said."", ""The CDC has produced more than 23 guidance documents on infection control, hospital preparedness, personal protective equipment supplies and clinical evaluation and management to help first responders and health systems prepare for the possible spread of the disease."", """", ""Those preparations include making sure enough supplies are available for response efforts."", ""For instance, Shah said his colleagues at the CDC have already taken an inventory of their personal protective equipment -- such as gowns, masks and respirators -- and have put in an order for additional supplies, as have many other state health departments."", 
""\""We are anticipating what potential needs the health care system in Maine, and New England as a whole, may have for those supplies and we're trying to think as many steps in advance as we can,\"" he said."", ""A call to stay informed"", ""While federal, state and local health departments are staying on top of preparation efforts, Shah has several suggestions on how average Americans can get prepared, too."", """", ""\""I'm recommending a few things. The first is to urge everyone to keep themselves and their families as healthy as possible. Exercise, eat a good diet, get a lot of sleep, wash your hands, do everything you can to stay healthy right now. The other thing we're recommending is that folks stay informed,\"" Shah said."",

It's day six of a two-week course of antibiotics, and you're feeling much better. You're ready for a return to normality, to being able to drink alcohol and eat what you want without worry, to not stressing about taking your pills at the right time."", ""Of course, as most people (hopefully) know, stopping antibiotics at this point is the worst possible move, risking a return of the infection or enabling the bug to develop resistance to medicine, potentially putting more people at risk down the line. And yet many people still do it, because it's hard, when things feel like they're going back to normal, to continue to follow medical precautions, particularly ones that effect our day-to-day lives."", 
""A similar dynamic is developing with the novel coronavirus. Even as new outbreaks are reported around the world and we edge towards pandemic levels, the situation is stabilizing in some areas where infections were first detected and people are starting to return to normality."", ""In China particularly, there has been a major drop in the number of new cases reported in the past week, particularly outside of Hubei, the province where the outbreak began. This has led some areas to lower travel restrictions and begin the slow process of getting back to work."", 
""Liaoning, a province in northeastern China that borders North Korea, was the first to downgrade the coronavirus emergency response level from the highest level -- Level 1 -- to Level 3 on Saturday, according to a statement by the provincial government. This was followed by Shanxi, Guangdong, Yunnan, Gansu and Guizhou, accounting for some 305 million people."", ""In Hong Kong too, where actions taken by the semi-autonomous Chinese city appear to have avoided an outbreak on the scale of the 2003 SARS crisis, there is a sense of very gradual relaxation. Although two people have died from the virus and the number of confirmed cases continues to rise -- it is now more than 90 -- an increasing number of the city's residents are beginning to slowly venture back out and about again. Some are even dispensing with face masks, previously a rare sight."", 
""The relative success of Hong Kong in preventing the type of fast expanding mass outbreaks seen first in mainland China and now South Korea and other countries is likely due to the effectiveness of precautions, including closing schools and having large numbers of residents work at home to increase social distancing."", ""But as time goes on, and as cabin fever grows, it's only natural for people to feel like it's maybe time to go back to the office -- despite the potential risk. On Wednesday, the Hong Kong government announced a major economic relief package, boosting, perhaps unintentionally, the sense that the worst may have passed."", 
"""", """", ""Mixed messages"", ""While a desire to return to normal after weeks of paranoia and quarantine is understandable, the danger may be far from over, particularly in mainland China."", ""Since the outbreak began in December last year, more than 78,000 cases have been confirmed inside of Mainland China, with the death toll rising to more than 2,700."", ""Serious questions remain over the accuracy of the country's data on the virus, however, with multiple shifts in how cases are reported or categorized. Outside of Hubei itself, where a huge amount of resources and emergency staff have been deployed, there are fears that cases may be missed or go undiagnosed."", 
""Even if the data is accurate, and the number of cases is stabilizing, it may be weeks before it is safe for people to be moving around freely again or gathering in large numbers. We know that the virus can lie dormant and there is strong evidence that it is spread while people are asymptomatic."", ""This was presumably the thinking behind postponing the annual meeting of China's rubber-stamp parliament, which was due to open on March 5 in Beijing."", ""But the messaging from the Chinese authorities has been mixed at best and often somewhat contradictory."", 
""State media has been playing up stories of perseverance and self-sacrifice, while the country's censors have been going after any criticism of the government and clamping down on VPNs used to bypass the Great Firewall. At the same time, many foreign media websites have been blocked, and Chinese authorities have criticized some coverage by the international press."", ""Taking matters a step further, the central propaganda authorities announced they will soon publish a book -- in six different languages -- on China's efforts to combat the virus, with a focus on President Xi Jinping's \""outstanding leadership, strategic vision, sense of mission and care for the people.\"""", 
""And yet, amid these \""mission accomplished\"" vibes, Xi himself warned Wednesday that \""the situation in Hubei Province and its capital city of Wuhan remains complex and grim, and the risk of a rebound of the epidemic in other regions can not be overlooked.\"""", ""Economic pain"", ""Economically, the coronavirus has already had a major toll, affecting everything from property sales to box office receipts, and leaving many businesses shuttered for weeks as employees remain under quarantine."", ""Writing Wednesday, Mark Williams, an analyst at Capital Economics, said that the Chinese economy \""will contract outright in year-on-year terms this quarter, for the first time since at least the 1990s.\"" While a stimulus package is in the works, it will likely not prevent a slowdown in annual growth."", 
""Hong Kong is also feeling the pinch. The city was already in a technical recession following months of protests last year and the virus outbreak and accompanying slowdown has only made the situation worse. While some analysts said the cash payout announced by the government this week could help stimulate the economy, officials have warned it could take up to three months for people to actually receive the money."", ""If the initial outbreak has been devastating for the Chinese economy, a second could be even worse, further undermining confidence and adding more strain to businesses already teetering. It could also potentially lead to widespread discontent with the government, particularly as it has been pushing the narrative that it is on top of things."", 
""China's leaders have taken dramatic steps to rein in the virus, quarantining millions of people and putting much of the country on lockdown. Were these to have turned out to be for nothing, the public anger could be massive."", ""At the same time, there's only so long you can expect people to put up with what are often extremely limiting restrictions, particularly when the immediate danger appears to have passed."", ""China's leaders undoubtedly understand these risks, and will be weighing them against the costs of keeping so much of the country out of work for so long. Hopefully a gradual return to normality will be just that, rather than a window for the outbreak to rebound."""

Late last month, the World Health Organization declared the virus, named COVID-19, a \""Public Health Emergency of International Concern\"" and urged an immediate international response."", ""It advised its member states to put in place national preparedness plans and procedures for identifying and responding to any COVID-19 cases that might present. The death toll of more than 2,600 people far exceeds that of the SARS outbreak nearly 17 years ago."", 
"""", ""This outbreak is terrifying for the tens of millions of people impacted in Wuhan and in countries around the world, and it arguably could not come at a worse time for Americans."", ""There's a famous adage in public health: \""Outbreaks are inevitable; epidemics are not.\"""", ""That's because experts across virology, genetics, epidemiology, mathematical modeling, political science, and anthropology are working to answer crucial questions, such as: When did the virus make the jump from animals to humans, and from which species? How widespread are cases, how infectious is the disease and how fatal is it?"", 
""Scientists are also conducting crucial research to help develop a vaccine, diagnose cases more rapidly and develop public health containment strategies. Under former President Barack Obama, infrastructure was established to respond to the Ebola and Zika outbreaks and to ensure that they did not become pandemics."", """", ""Unfortunately, President Donald Trump has taken actions that many doctors and experts agree will leave the US less prepared to respond to COVID-19. He has eliminated the position of Global Health Czar and has repeatedly proposed cuts important to global health funding -- thankfully that have failed to pass in Congress."", 
""He's shown his antipathy toward addressing health emergencies like this one, most recently in his proposed 2021 budget for the Department of Health and Human Services, which would cut $3 billion from response and preparedness funds. We write this with long experience in global health and having looked closely at outbreak prevention and response in our book, \""Governing Global Health: Who Runs the World and Why?\"""", ""Two aspects in particular worry us about the White House's response, or lack thereof. We have a President uninterested in global health concerns, broadly disdainful of experts and recently obsessed with and distracted by his impeachment."", 
""Trump has often shown deep ignorance and cruelty on issues of global health. During the Ebola outbreak, when he was still a reality TV host, he said the US should not allow Ebola-infected citizens and aid workers to come back to the US and should let them \""suffer the consequences.\"""", ""He even deliberately spread misinformation, saying Ebola was: \""Spreading all over Africa-and fast. Stop flights\"" and \""The U.S. must immediately stop all flights from EBOLA infected countries or the plague will start and spread inside our 'borders.' Act fast!\"" He said this even though halting flights would bring potentially harmful consequences, like \""hindering info-sharing, medical supply chains and harming economies,\"" according to the World Health Organization director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus."", 
"""", ""In 2014-2015 during the Ebola outbreak, his apparent disdain lived largely on Twitter. Now, in addition to sharing his often false opinions on Twitter, he claimed earlier this month that the coronavirus would weaken in the warmer weather despite no evidence to that effect."", ""The Trump administration is chronically inept at, and seemingly uninterested in, any type of long-term planning, given the numerous positions in government that remain vacant as well as the constant rotation of key cabinet positions and the ad hoc decisions made on the basis of a conversation or Fox News clip."", 
""That posture, colliding with an anti-science and anti-expert bias, has corroded our epidemic preparedness. Columbia University has even tracked more than 400 cases of the Trump administration's efforts to restrict or dismiss scientific research, education or discussion, or the publication or use of scientific information since 2016."", ""The dissolution of the entire global health security unit and removal of global health security expert Timothy Ziemer from the National Security Council was the final step in a process of undermining one of the Obama administration's key decisions on global health."", 
""The unit monitored epidemics and ensured that public health planning was coordinated within the more traditional security infrastructure. The lack of a clear chain of command for pandemic response is exactly the opposite of what is needed during an outbreak: clear governance, strategic thinking and forward-planning."", ""To put it simply, the Trump administration, by seeking to cut funding and rejecting proven solutions, is not sufficiently prepared to face a major threat like the novel coronavirus outbreak.  As the American people face what the World Health Organization has deemed a public health emergency, we need a strong leader who understands the importance of good governance, expertise and diverse perspectives in bringing outbreaks under control."", 
""The next election provides an opportunity to safeguard the health of people both in the US and around the world. We hope the Democratic candidates will outline what they would do to respond to the current coronavirus crisis and how they would prevent future epidemics through investments in research, expertise and infrastructure."", """

Though the majority of cases and deaths remain in mainland China, these past two weeks have seen self-sustaining clusters form in Europe, the Middle East, and the United States -- and new cases reported in Africa and Latin America."", 
""Countries are now scrambling to contain the virus, imposing travel restrictions and mandatory quarantines -- an echo of the shutdowns and emergency measures that swept across Asia two months ago."", ""As Asia continues to grapple with rising numbers of infections, here are ten lessons -- good and bad -- from the region on how to deal with a coronavirus outbreak."", ""Be transparent with the public"", ""Government transparency and publicly accessible information can help educate citizens on the risks and necessary precautionary measures, as well as avoid panic or misinformation."", 
""Singapore, for example, sends out daily briefings on coronavirus updates -- how many new cases are confirmed, how many patients have been discharged from hospital, and whether new clusters are appearing."", ""And in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan and South Korea, government agencies have launched aggressive public information campaigns on what is being done and what citizens can do, distributing this information on citywide posters, television ads, and more."", ""In Japan, regular flu cases have dropped dramatically -- reportedly because of this rise in public education and health awareness, according to local media."", 
""A lack of reliable information can also give rise to baseless rumors. In Singapore, a false claim that a foreign domestic worker had died took hold. The government quickly released a statement clarifying that was false; nobody has died of coronavirus in Singapore thus far."", ""Transparency helps reduce hysteria, and gives other countries and international experts important information in understanding the spread of the virus."", ""Crucially, government willingness to share hard truths -- with both the public and internally within government -- can help avoid fatal missteps, such as those made in China during the early weeks of the outbreak."", 
""In December, when the virus first began spreading, whistleblowers like Li Wenliang, in the Chinese city of Wuhan, tried to warn people -- but were silenced by authorities. Li, who was made to sign a police statement about his \""misdemeanor,\"" died in February of the virus, sparking public fury and deep mistrust of the government."", ""Conduct social distancing"", ""The virus spreads when people are in close physical contact -- so one of the most important measures a government or its people can take is social distancing."", 
""Social distancing is exactly what it sounds like -- putting some distance between yourself and others, and avoiding situations where you might be close to many other people."", ""To this end, countries across Asia have suspended schools, canceled public gatherings such as Lunar New Year festivities, closed public spaces like swimming pools, and recommended people work from home."", ""In China, more than 780 million people -- about half the country's population -- are still under some form of travel restrictions, as part of the effort to limit people's exposure to each other."", 
""We're already starting to see some of these social distancing measures come into effect in big cities across Europe, where the outbreak began in Italy in mid-February."", ""More than 100 schools have closed in France's Oise region, affecting more than 28,000 students. The Louvre museum in Paris and the famed La Scala opera house in Milan both closed, and the Paris half-marathon has been canceled."", ""The Louvre was shut for three days, then re-opened on Wednesday, announcing in a Facebook statement that its doors are open."", 
""Be ahead of the game"", ""Authorities can prepare for an outbreak even before the virus arrives in large numbers."", ""In January, as it became clear that the virus was spreading rapidly across Asia, countries got ready by setting up quarantine centers, ordering more medical supplies in advance, and organizing cross-departmental government emergency response committees."", ""Taiwan formed an epidemic response command center and in late January; that same week, the island confirmed its first case. Other preemptive measures included preparing more than 1,000 beds in isolation wards, conducting drills at hospitals and facilities for infection control, and stocking up on medical supplies to counter rumors of shortages."", 
""And in Thailand, the first place the virus spread outside China, authorities set up widespread temperature screenings at transport hubs days after the first case."", ""Some countries like the US and UK have begun adopting similar measures."", ""San Francisco declared a state of emergency -- allowing the city to get reimbursed by state and federal governments for money it spends on preparedness."", ""And New York has been preparing for weeks. In February, the city distributed about 1.5 million face masks, and asked for an additional minimum of 300,000 masks, and has prepared at least 1,200 hospital beds for potential coronavirus patients."", 
""Get tested early"", ""Countries can also encourage early testing, and make testing available across local districts, to identify the arrival of the virus fast."", ""South Korea is a good example of widespread, early testing and heightened vigilance in reporting symptoms -- the country's health ministry has rolled out a smartphone app that asks citizens to do a daily check of their symptoms, and to notify local health officials if necessary."", ""The South Korean city of Goyang has even set up a drive-through coronavirus testing site: people drive into a parking lot, where health workers in hazmat suits register drivers, check their temperatures, and take samples."", 
"""", ""Drivers go through the entire testing process in a matter of minutes without ever getting out of their cars -- making it easy for more people to get tested quickly, as well as protecting healthcare workers from exposure to the virus."", ""These kinds of measures allow authorities to quarantine patients and the people they have been in contact with, thus containing the virus quickly, rather than allow it to spread with untested infected people in the community."", ""Spread good hygiene practices"", 
""Washing your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, covering your mouth and nose when you sneeze or cough, avoiding touching your eyes or mouth with your hands, and being cautious of the surfaces you touch can make a big difference."", ""Countries across Asia launched public awareness campaigns, with governments spreading tips on how to keep good hygiene."", ""In cities like Hong Kong, people have taken to wearing gloves when they go out, and using disinfectant or alcohol wipes to regularly clean surfaces. One common practice is to cover elevator buttons in buildings with a plastic sheet, making it easy to disinfect the surface every few hours."",

Some companies have sent all non-essential employees home, while others have adopted a tag team method, with groups of employees taking turns coming into the office."", 
""There certainly are difficulties -- if schools are suspended, parents working from home may also need to care for their children, and working remotely isn't practical for some in customer service industries of front-of-house roles."", ""But modern technology also makes it easier to have entire companies work from home: Asian companies have been using tools like video conferencing, instant messaging applications, VPN systems and cloud-based filing."", ""In Hong Kong, some employees told CNN that they were frustrated their employers didn't allow them to work remotely, as they felt it put them at a higher risk of infection."", 
""Don't panic buy"", ""In Hong Kong, the month of February was marked by panic buying and empty store aisles."", ""People feared closed borders could disrupt the supply line of toilet rolls -- despite the government's reassurances that it wouldn't -- and rushed to stock up. Supermarkets sold out, with some people bulk-buying enough to last them weeks."", ""And it's not just toilet rolls -- people have also been snatching up face masks, hand sanitizer, cleaning supplies, and food staples like rice."", ""The panic buying stoked unnecessary chaos and fear, and even led to crime -- in Hong Kong, several men were arrested last month for stealing 600 toilet rolls that had been delivered outside a supermarket."", 
""There are plenty of reasons to refrain from jumping on the panic buying bandwagon; it takes away critical supplies for frontliners and health care workers, and spreads hysteria. And often, the supply chains are fine -- CNN spoke with two major Hong Kong supermarkets, two shipping companies, and two container operators, all of which said there was no shortage or disruption of supplies."", ""Don't be afraid of your pets"", ""A dog tested positive for coronavirus in Hong Kong last week, sparking incorrect fears that pets may be able to catch and transmit the virus to their owners."",

Wash your hands after touching your pets, and if you're really concerned, wipe your pets' paws with antiseptic wipes after they've been outside."", ""Don't stigmatize patients"", ""As the virus spreads, so does fear, paranoia, and discrimination."", ""Experts have warned against stigmatizing patients; for instance, quarantines are undoubtedly vital to the containment process, but if done improperly, patients could potentially be treated with less dignity and respect."", 
""And in largely white countries like the US, UK, and Australia, stigma can take a more xenophobic, at times outright racist, form -- there has been an uptick of racist assaults and harassment in these places, targeted at people of Chinese or East Asian descent."", """", ""It's also why the director general of the World Health Organization urged countries not to impose trade bans in February, warning that it could feed \""fear and stigma, with little public health benefit.\"""", ""\""Where such measures have been implemented, we urge that they are short in duration, proportionate to the public health risks, and are reconsidered regularly as the situation evolves,\"" he added."", 
""And finally -- don't panic"", ""While governments and citizens should prepare for the virus, it's also important not to panic."", ""Based on current available data, the virus is thought to have a fatality rate of about 2% -- that's higher than influenza, which is about 0.1%, but much lower than severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, (9.6%) and MERS, Middle East respiratory syndrome (35%)."", ""For many people, symptoms are just like those of a common cold, and may go away on their own."", ""In China, more than half of all cases have recovered and been discharged from hospital -- 47,204 out of a total of 80,151 cases, according to the country's National Health Commission."", 
""For those with a weakened immune system, the elderly and the very young, there's a chance the virus could cause a more serious illness such as pneumonia or bronchitis. People with symptoms that feel worse than a standard cold should see their doctor."

""However, the government has also hit snags. There are widespread concerns about the accessibility of testing kits, while a botched roll-out of US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) testing, and strict criteria on who could be examined, caused a delay in testing."", ""The US has only been able to perform about 3,600 tests so far -- especially striking when compared to countries like South Korea and in Europe, where thousands of tests are being run daily."", ""The FDA commissioner initially said the US should be able to perform about 1 million tests by the end of this week -- but clarified later that there was a difference \""between the ability to get the test kits out to the laboratories with the ability of the labs to actually do the tests.\"""",

The virus has now been reported on every continent except Antarctica."", ""Concerns about the virus have also spread across the world. We asked you for your questions about coronavirus. Here's some of the ones that have been asked the most:"", ""What are the symptoms of coronavirus?"", ""The novel coronavirus, a cousin of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus, has symptoms that include a runny nose, cough, sore throat, possibly a headache and maybe a fever, which can last for a couple of days."", 
""For those with a weakened immune system, the elderly and the very young, there's a chance the virus could cause a lower, and much more serious, respiratory tract illness like pneumonia or bronchitis."", ""How is it treated?"", ""There is no specific treatment, but research is underway."", ""Most of the time, symptoms will go away on their own, and experts advise seeking care early. If symptoms feel worse than a standard cold, see your doctor."", ""Doctors can relieve symptoms by prescribing pain or fever medication. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says a room humidifier or a hot shower can help with a sore throat or cough."", 
""Drink plenty of fluids, get rest and sleep as much as possible."", ""Is there a coronavirus vaccine?"", ""Scientists are working on a vaccine, but don't expect it anytime soon."", ""The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is trying to develop one but says it will take at least a few months before clinical trials start and more than a year until a vaccine could become available."", ""Separately, scientists in Texas, New York and China are also trying to create a vaccine, said Dr. Peter Hotez, a vaccine scientist at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston."", 
""But the challenge is daunting, Hotez said."", ""\""The lesson we've learned is coronavirus infections are serious and one of the newest and biggest global health threats,\"" he said."", ""Does the flu shot protect me from coronavirus?"", ""Dr. Leana Wen, the former health commissioner of Baltimore, said the flu shot doesn't protect people from coronavirus — but that doesn't mean you shouldn't get it."", ""\""The flu, influenza is a separate virus from coronavirus,\"" she told CNN. \""And so getting the flu shot does not protect you from getting coronavirus — but it does protect you from getting the flu, which is important because there have been over — there have been tens of thousands of deaths from influenza this season in the US.\"""", 
""Wen urged Americans who have not get gotten a flu shot to get it now. Older people and those with chronic conditions should also consider getting the pneumonia vaccine."", ""Should I be wearing a mask?"", ""The CDC does not recommend that people who are well wear face masks."", ""Rather, the CDC recommends to only wear a mask if a health care professional recommends it. A face mask should be used by people who have the novel coronavirus and are showing symptoms — that is in order to protect others from the risk of getting infected."", 
""Overall, the use of face masks remains crucial for health workers and people who are caring for someone infected with the virus in close settings, such as a health care facility or at home, according to the CDC."", ""US Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams urged people to stop buying masks, noting how crucial they are for health care workers."", ""\""They are NOT effective in preventing general public from catching #Coronavirus, but if healthcare providers can't get them to care for sick patients, it puts them and our communities at risk!\"" he tweeted."", 
""How can I protect myself from the virus?"", ""In general, the public should do \""what you do every cold and flu season,\"" said Dr. John Wiesman, the health secretary in Washington state."", ""That includes washing your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds."", ""The World Health Organization recommends staying at least 3 feet away from anyone who may be infected. If you're the one feeling sick, cover your entire mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze. But don't use your hands. Use either your bent elbow or a tissue that you throw away immediately afterward."", 
""What can I do to prepare for an outbreak in my area?"", ""In terms of supplies, the US Department of Homeland Security recommends on its website that, before a pandemic strikes, to store a two-week supply of water and food, as well as over-the-counter medications you tend to take."", ""\""Have any nonprescription drugs and other health supplies on hand, including pain relievers, stomach remedies, cough and cold medicines, fluids with electrolytes, and vitamins,\"" according to the department."", ""Should I cancel my travel plans?"", 
""Unfortunately, there's no one-size-fits-all answer."", ""It's very much an individual calculation, experts say, taking a number of factors — the traveler, their companions, the destination and more — into consideration."", ""In a situation that's unpredictable and evolving quickly, solid information is key."", ""Pay attention to travel advisories: The CDC and the US State Department are both issuing regular travel advisories for destinations that are significantly impacted by the virus outbreak. Monitor those \""closely and regularly,\"" advises Dr. Henry Wu, director of Emory Healthcare's TravelWell Center."", 
""Elderly travelers or those who have other conditions should consider that they might be at higher risk for complications of infections, Wu said."", ""You can read more about how coronavirus is impacting travel plans here."", ""CNN's Leah Asmelash, Jacqueline Howard, Marine Hunter and Holly Yan contributed to this article."

But although the Japanese government says it has the capacity to carry out 3,800 tests a day, only 8,111 tests had been conducted as of March 4, according to the country's Health Ministry."", 
""On Wednesday, Japan recorded 33 new cases of Covid-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus, its highest one-day increase since the outbreak began, according to numbers released by the Health Ministry. The overall total now stands at 1,023, of which 706 are from the Diamond Princess cruise ship."", ""But Japan's coronavirus figures are likely already much higher than reported, with the infection rate suspected to be just the \""tip of the iceberg,\"" according to Masahiro Kami, the executive director of Japan's Medical Governance Research Institute, a non-profit group."", 
""Kami says for every one patient tested, there are many more who remain undiagnosed. But as most of these people are either asymptomatic or have mild symptoms they don't go to a clinic to get checked out."", ""Guidelines from the Health Ministry say people should get tested if they have cold-like symptoms, a fever of 37.5 Celsius, or experience extreme tiredness or breathing problems for four days or more. In the meantime, they should self-quarantine."", ""Senior citizens or people with preexisting medical conditions that put them at higher risk should seek testing if they exhibit symptoms for two or more days, according to the guidelines."", 
""The advice was given to prevent people from inundating clinics and hospitals. But it has done little to soothe public anxiety or curb the spread of the virus."", ""Inadequate testing scheme"", ""In Japan's northern island of Hokkaido, the governor has declared a state of emergency. The popular tourist spot has been particularly hard hit, accounting for more than a quarter of all non-cruise ship related cases in the country."", ""But while the official number of people infected with coronavirus in Hokkaido may now be in the 80s, the actual number is likely to be ten times higher, said Hiroshi Nishiura, an epidemiologist at Hokkaido university. Nishiura, who is assisting the government in creating statistical models to help predict the spread of the virus, said the estimated figure is consistent with what he had seen in the Chinese city of Wuhan -- the epicenter of the outbreak."", 
""Japan's Health Ministry, however, has so far refuted Nishiura's estimates. It suggested Japan is likely to have around 3,000 coronavirus cases in total. \""We understand there are people we have not detected,\"" the ministry said in a statement provided to CNN."", ""The ministry added it was aware \""many people want to take the test\"" and that it would \""expand the target range\"" to include people showing \""mild symptoms.\"""", ""Irrespective of the total figure, it is likely the coronavirus infection rate will rise as more people are tested, said Kenji Shibuya director of the Institute for Population Health at King's College London, and a former chief of health policy at the World Health Organization."", 
""In order to ease public anxiety, tests in Japan should become more widely available, with priority given to senior citizens, who are most at risk, said Shibuya."", ""Though Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has said he is considering the possibility of declaring a nationwide state of emergency that would grant more powers to local authorities to enforce a ban on public gatherings and encourage people to stay at home, Shibuya suggested the government should focus on preparing contingency plans in the event of a larger outbreak."", 
""According to Shibuya, it is important to treat those who are critically ill and protect those most at risk, as even asymptomatic people can pass the virus on to others."", ""Kami, of Japan's Medical Governance Research Institute, corroborated that view, noting that the most important thing is to prevent infections in old people in nursing homes, hospitals and houses."", ""\""If senior citizens are infected they become seriously ill and their mortality rate (with the coronavirus) is more than 10%,\"" said Kami."", 
""'Biggest threat is panic, not the virus itself'"", ""The coronavirus has spread from China, to more than 75 countries and regions, killing more than 3,200 people and infecting more than 95,000 people globally."", ""And as the outbreak casts a shadow over the economy and Tokyo's preparations to host the Summer Olympics, Abe has stressed that the next couple of weeks will be crucial in the battle to contain its spread."", ""Japan has already started to take a number of precautions to overcome and prevent the spread of the virus."", 
""Many large-scale public gatherings and sporting events have been scaled down or canceled. Japanese companies have also adopted the practice of encouraging their employees to work from home to prevent exposing them to the virus on congested public transport and in offices."", ""But critics have accused Abe of prioritizing the Olympics and bilateral ties over national security, particularly as Japan did not shut down its borders during the early stages of the outbreak."", ""\""The Japanese government has taken relative soft stance when it comes to blocking the flow of people from China to Japan compared to some other countries,\"" said Koichi Nakano, a political science professor at Sophia University."", 
""Nakano said this angered both Abe's supporters and opponents."", ""Last week, a decision by most schools to shut down also sparked criticism, with many parents unsure of how they would cope in a country where nannies and domestic helpers are uncommon."", ""As anxiety grew, many rushed out to stock up on goods such as toilet and tissue paper after an online rumor alleged that most of Japan's supplies came from China, where factories were shutting down."", ""And with masks and hand sanitizer already in short supply, Shibuya said that panic poses a bigger threat than the virus itself."", 
""\""In the end, Covid-19 is a mild cold for the majority of people, the biggest fear is not the virus itself but the panic, which is happening unfortunately,\"" said Shibuya."

This week, she's noticed a change in the crowds, not in the morning, but in the afternoons."", ""In the past, it's been much busier in the evenings, she says."", ""\""It's definitely dropped off since the coronavirus scare,\"" she said."", ""Standing near the front of the market, she says it feels like 20 years ago when fewer people live in Seattle. She thinks it's that fewer tourists are coming to Seattle, which is in King County, the epicenter of the US outbreak with 58 cases and more than 10 deaths."", 
""\""There's way fewer tourists for sure,\"" she says. Pointing to the entrance she says there are usually plenty of people taking photos there, even at this hour. Today it appears there are just people making deliveries and going to work."", ""There's a new reality beginning to form in the city of almost 800,000 people, affecting nearly every aspect of life from business to traffic and even education."", ""Empty hallways"", ""Fewer people are going to work -- or to school. Big companies have told employees to telework and the University of Washington and a Seattle area school district have told their 80,000 students combined to take their classes online for up to several weeks."", 
""\""I want people to know that when we have a fact pattern that affects the safety and health of our students that we're going to stop and recognize that it's not business as usual and we're going to make space to make a thoughtful and measured decision,\"" said Michelle Reid, the superintendent of the Northshore School District."", ""Students and faculty will return to campus when the data indicates it is appropriate, she told CNN."", ""The University of Washington says that it was going to close its physical classrooms on three campuses before a staff member tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. The two factors aren't correlated as the decision to close classrooms came \""much earlier in the day,\"" according to University of Washington spokesman Victor Balta"", 
""The school says it is not closing any campuses, saying there are essential services for its 54,000-plus students outside the classrooms that will continue to be provided in person."", ""The quarter ends in two weeks."", ""Empty seats"", ""People tell CNN that they've noticed small changes that might be attributed to residents staying home. A woman who was walking at Green Lake Park says she went to opening night for the popular play \""Jitney,\"" put on by the Seattle Rep, where there should have been a full house."", 
""There were rows of empty seats, Margaret Winsor says. She also sees fewer people at the park this morning."", ""People are probably just taking precautions, she says."", ""Brenna Louzin, who was walking with a different group at the park, agreed that foot (and car traffic) was down lately."", ""\""I think people are just afraid to go out,\"" she said. \""I think it seems a little more empty like many of the streets, (though) I haven't been downtown.\"""", ""Louzin said the group was without one walker this morning because one woman had a fever. So, they told her it was probably best to stay home."", 
""Slowing business"", ""Michele Auld owns a dessert shop and she's stressed. A majority of her business is people who come by to get cupcakes, cookies and other delicious treats."", ""Business at Indu!ge Desserts is off from walk-ins and people aren't coming in and hanging out as much.

""She has three employees and there are fewer shifts these days."", ""\""It all feels like it's trickling down,\"" she says."", ""She says in the short term she is trying to keep appropriate stock levels and not overschedule. After that, she doesn't have a plan. She is hopeful people in Seattle will try to keep some normalcy in their lives. Because if normalcy goes away, \""I'm not sure what it looks like after that.\"""
