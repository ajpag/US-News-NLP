Stock prices fell Monday, no doubt in part as investors took profits before the end of the year. But what profits they probably are. With one day of trading left in 2019, the S&P 500 was up 29% for the year, the Nasdaq Composite had risen 35%, and even the dowdy Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 22%.  Apple  and  Microsoft ,  which drove much of the increase in the Nasdaq, each now have market capitalizations of more than $1.2 trillion. Anyone who sold a year ago missed a major boost in net worth, yet at the time the investor mood was negative. Markets had declined in the fourth quarter of 2018 as the Federal Reserve tightened money and Donald Trump’s trade war accelerated. Fears of recession were widespread, and even Mr. Trump had stopped touting stock prices on  Twitter . One lesson is that no one knows how stocks will perform in any given year because so much can change. In 2019 the Fed quickly corrected its December 2018 mistake of raising interest rates. Inflation stayed under control. Mr. Trump decided that he wanted a trade truce with China, notwithstanding some harrowing fits and starts along the way. The momentum built by tax reform and deregulation helped the economy, and especially the job market, stay remarkably buoyant despite a trade-induced recession in manufacturing.

Yet I still found myself lying awake at night worrying that I was falling short, both at work and at home. Discouraged by five-figure child-care costs and the difficulty of setting boundaries on my work hours, I quit two newspaper jobs I loved in rapid succession. I was a bureau chief, then a part-time reporter. And then I was neither. I created the Work & Family column for the Journal soon thereafter in hopes of shedding light on the problems of working mothers and finding solutions. More than 1,000 columns later, some of the problems have eased, but others still loom, and new obstacles have emerged. On the eve of my retirement, I decided to take one last look at all that’s changed, and, sadly, all that hasn’t. When I started my column in 1991, the share of married mothers holding paid jobs outside the home had reached 71%, up from 42% at the end of the 1960s. Many were hitting a brick wall. Managers trained in the Reagan era, almost all of them men, had little patience for the stresses that mothers faced. Some women were so worried they’d be penalized at work for caring about their kids that they hid family photos at the office. Any suggestion that working fathers might want paternity leave drew disdainful laughter. Beth Makens Long, a utility-industry salesperson whom I profiled in my column in 1996, labored long and hard to earn her male colleagues’ respect. She wore the dark, boxy suits with skirts and heels that were de rigueur for working women at the time—even on days the men showed up in golf shirts.  "

A series of articles by The Wall Street Journal has identified numerous deficiencies at the federal agency, including problem employees, recruitment challenges and regulatory lapses. The turmoil has sparked calls for changes. The agency has chronic problems, and it is underfunded and overwhelmed, said            Earl Pomeroy,      a former Democratic North Dakota congressman. Nevertheless, said            James Bresette,      a former deputy director of the agency’s clinical-services arm, “there’s definitely some low-hanging fruit” that he believes the agency is capable of addressing. The Journal’s reporting on the agency and new interviews with people who have faced the problems suggest several possible courses of action. Congress has provided modest increases to the IHS’s operating funding in recent years, but that still leaves the agency far behind other federal health programs. Medicare spends about three times as much per patient. “We’re at Congress’s whim in that regard,” the agency’s acting director,            Michael Weahkee,      said in a meeting with tribal leaders earlier this year. Rear Adm. Weahkee was nominated to become the agency’s permanent leader in October. The agency’s leaders and federal overseers have stopped short of asking Congress for major new infusions during annual budget negotiations. At a December Senate hearing on his nomination, Adm. Weahkee was asked if he would commit to advocating for more upfront funding for the IHS. Doing so might set him at odds with his superiors in the Trump administration. He declined to say he would seek more funding. In a written statement, the IHS said it “works proactively within the administration and with the Congress to ensure the needs of Indian Country are fully understood.” The IHS, which doesn’t offer a full range of medical services at its hospitals, is supposed to pay for patients to get additional necessary care from outside hospitals and doctors. That funding falls short of what patients need, according to the agency’s own data, and the IHS distributes it unequally. In its Tucson, Ariz., region, the IHS allocated about $8,100 per uninsured patient in 2020, compared with around $1,000 in its Oklahoma area, a Journal analysis of 2017 agency data and budget records shows. In the Great Plains region, which includes the Rosebud Indian Health Service hospital in South Dakota, the allocation is about $2,200 per uninsured patient. What should the federal government do to improve care at the Indian Health Service? Join the conversation below. The disparities result from an outdated allocation formula that doesn’t take the needs of the patients into consideration—and means that in low-spending areas common services are often denied. At Rosebud, orthopedic procedures such as knee replacements and diagnostic services like certain lung tests often don’t get covered, doctors said. “It’s basically rationing,” said            Douglas Lehmann,      a former IHS doctor at Rosebud. The agency could fix this, said            Ron Cornelius,      a former Great Plains regional leader. But with finite resources, he said, “you’d have winners and losers, and so far nobody has taken that up.” The agency said one of its work groups recently recommended keeping the formula the same, and that its ability to change it was limited. Eight IHS-run hospitals with a combined 82 beds averaged less than one patient a night in 2018, according to IHS reports to federal regulators. The agency could close seldom-used inpatient wards located where there are other options and redirect the money, including toward better primary care for patients with serious chronic health problems. The agency said it might be appropriate to redirect resources from inpatient care to other services, such as specialty medical treatment, at some facilities where admissions have declined, and that it would consult the tribes before making any decisions. Parker Indian Health Center, in a tiny Arizona town, is about 1.5 miles from a private facility, La Paz Regional Hospital. La Paz’s 22 beds were about one-quarter full last year, regulatory records show. The IHS hospital, with around 20 beds, was only about 3% full, the records show. Neither facility delivers babies, forcing women to travel at least 40 miles for that service, according to the Arizona Center for Rural Health. It doesn’t make any sense to have two critical-access hospitals so close together, but not other needed services, said            Daniel Derksen,      a University of Arizona professor and the center’s director. Kevin Brown,      the chief executive of La Paz Regional, declined to comment. The Colorado River Indian Tribes, which the Parker hospital serves, said in a written statement “the facility is underutilized due to operational issues such as a lack of staff, and treatment decisions in which patients are released too soon.” The tribe said any reallocation of funding there would be a disservice to members that it would oppose. Many IHS problems stem from difficulties recruiting qualified employees to its remote facilities. The agency could fill gaps by working more closely with other health-care providers and partners, according to former employees and experts. “They operate so much in their own silo,” said            Donald Warne,      an associate dean at the University of North Dakota who directs its program to draw more Native Americans into the heath-care field. Doctors say the process of getting credentialed to see patients at an IHS facility, even on a volunteer basis, is cumbersome and flawed. The Journal has reported that the agency hired doctors with histories including up to a dozen malpractice claims, criminal convictions and sex-abuse allegations. “They could streamline much of their administrative burden,” said            Jeff Hostetter,      program director at the University of North Dakota Center for Family Medicine, who for years has volunteered at an IHS hospital where he once was employed. He said to keep working there, he recently had to complete an application about four times as long as ones he has filled out for private hospitals. The IHS said it has partnerships with several academic medical systems, such as one with Massachusetts General Hospital that provides doctors to Rosebud. The agency said it is expanding such partnerships. The IHS needs to overcome a nonconfrontational culture that can lead it to defer dealing with personnel problems, according to a report by the inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services. The Journal and the PBS series Frontline reported in February that the agency shuffled a pediatrician suspected of molesting boys from one hospital to another instead of confronting the problem directly. The doctor,            Stanley Patrick Weber,      has now been convicted of abusing six boys. He is appealing. “IHS is more risk averse than anybody else” when it comes to confronting personnel problems, said Mr. Bresette, the former IHS official, who also has worked in other agencies. The IHS said it is working to better track such situations, and that it is filling key positions with permanent leaders to ensure consistency and accountability. In one recent case, a clinic CEO named            Eyvonne Rekow      was suspended with pay in August 2017 for alleged misconduct, then relocated to a regional office for a spell, records show. She wasn’t charged and has denied wrongdoing, and was later assigned to work from home. She was never given any duties. She has collected her $80,000-plus annual salary ever since. Ms. Rekow remains in limbo. She said: “How is this a good use of taxpayers’ money?” Write to Christopher Weaver at christopher.weaver@wsj.com and Anna Wilde Mathews at anna.mathews@wsj.com Copyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The number of sanctions imposed against alleged human rights abusers under programs implementing the U.S. Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act reached an all-time high in 2019 due to a surge in designations in December. There are at least 190 individuals and entities designated under the Global Magnitsky program, according to data compiled by Dow Jones Risk & Compliance. Ninety-six of them were issued in 2019, most during the week of Dec. 9 when some countries commemorate efforts to promote human rights and fight corruption. On Dec. 9, which was International Anticorruption Day, and Dec. 10, which was Human Rights Day, the U.S. Treasury Department blacklisted 68 individuals and entities under the Global Magnitsky sanctions program. The U.S. Magnitsky Act, named after Russian lawyer            Sergei Magnitsky      who died in a Moscow prison after accusing government officials of corruption, was signed into law in 2012 and was intended to only target human rights abusers in Russia. The law was a precursor to the U.S. government’s more expansive Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, which was approved in 2016 by Congress and targets alleged corrupt actors and human-rights offenders beyond Russia’s borders. Under the Global Magnitsky sanctions program, alleged human-rights abusers face visa restrictions to enter the U.S. and their U.S. assets are blocked. President Trump said in an executive order in December 2017 that serious human rights abuse and corruption across the globe constitute a threat to U.S. national security. Our Morning Risk Report features insights and news on governance, risk and compliance. The number of designations during the week of Dec. 9 was the most levied for any week in the Global Magnitsky sanctions program’s history and accounts for about 35% of all designations under the Global Magnitsky Act, according to data from compliance software company Accuity Inc. The actions targeted people and entities across Europe, Asia, Africa and Latin America. The surge of sanctions against alleged human rights violators in 2019 is in line with the Trump administration’s heavy use of sanctions across the board, said            Rob Berschinski,      a senior vice president for policy at the advocacy group Human Rights First who served as deputy assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights, and labor during the Obama administration. The overall number of sanctions levied by the U.S.—not just those for human rights—jumped in the past three years, as the Trump administration exerted economic pressure to pursue foreign policy objectives. In 2019, the U.S. blacklisted about 900 individuals and entities, on top of more than 1,450—a record—during the previous year, according to data from Dow Jones Risk & Compliance.  The Trump administration has designated more than 700 individuals and entities linked to corruption or human rights abuse under a variety of sanctions programs, including the Global Magnitsky authorities, according to a Treasury Department spokeswoman. The U.S. uses sanctions as a way to keep corrupt actors accountable, she said, and the Treasury Department typically releases sanctions designations as soon as they are ready. The recently announced sanctions took months to put together and clear through the interagency and legal processes, she said. The Treasury Department decided to announce them on International Anticorruption Day and Human Rights Day. “If it is very important for the human rights community, it’d make sense for us to highlight them” on specific days, the spokeswoman said. The Treasury Department blacklisted three North Korean officials for alleged human rights violations on the week of Human Rights Day in 2018. “The political value of the Global Magnitsky Act is that it provides the U.S. with a ready instrument to sanction perpetrators of serious human rights abuses quickly, whenever a significant offense occurs,” said            Vincent Gaudel,      a compliance analyst at Accuity. The U.S. Treasury Department in November 2018 also blacklisted 17 individuals for their alleged roles in the murder of dissident Saudi journalist            Jamal Khashoggi,      who was killed about a month prior. Bill Browder, the chief executive and co-founder of Hermitage Capital Management, advocated for the enactment of the U.S. Magnitsky Act following the 2009 death of Mr. Magnitsky, who was an attorney for Mr. Browder. “The implementation of the Global Magnitsky Act has far exceeded my expectations when we were working to get the law passed,” Mr. Browder said in an interview.

But he faces a demographic challenge: The electorate has changed since he was last on the ballot in ways likely to benefit Democrats. Working-class, white voters are projected to decline by 2.3 percentage points nationally as a share of eligible voters, compared with the last election, because they are older and therefore dying at a faster rate than are Democratic groups. As those voters pass on, they are most likely to be replaced by those from minority groups or young, white voters with college degrees—groups that lean Democratic. That means Mr. Trump will have to coax more votes from a shrinking base—or else find more votes in other parts of the electorate. “Trump has a certain hill to climb, and this suggests that the hill gets a little steeper,’’ said Ruy Teixeira, a demographer with the States of Change project, which provided assessments of the 2020 electorate. The project is a joint venture of think tanks with different ideological leanings: the liberal Center for American Progress, where Mr. Teixeira works; the center-left Brookings Institution; the Bipartisan Policy Center; and the Democracy Fund Voter Study Group, which includes participants from across the political spectrum.

Now, the onetime digital-media darling is edging closer to profitability thanks to staff cuts and efforts in recent years to generate new revenue streams, such as launching its own line of kitchenware and investing in a chain of stores selling quirky toys. “There has been this idea that digital media companies have been forced to diversify their revenue because times have been tough,” BuzzFeed founder and Chief Executive Jonah Peretti said in an interview. “But the other side of the story is that the internet has really allowed for the creation of a new kind of media company that wasn’t entirely possible in the past.” Five years ago, the company relied solely on native advertising—articles or quizzes written by BuzzFeed that promote a product or service but are labeled as sponsored content. Now it makes up just 30% of the business, with the rest coming from other forms of advertising, commerce and content-licensing fees, according to a memo Mr. Peretti sent employees on Friday. Mr. Peretti said the company’s newer lines of business brought in over $200 million last year, and that every unit of the company except for its news division is now profitable.

But look who’s clearing the ground for the country’s largest solar farm—and who’s opposing it. The Bureau of Land Management this week released an environmental impact statement indicating its intent to approve the 7,100-acre Gemini solar farm east of Las Vegas. The project could power 130,000 homes and would include four-hour lithium ion batteries to store solar energy for use at night. Gemini is the type of renewable energy project that environmental groups claim will be needed to move from fossil fuels that, unlike solar and wind, can provide power on demand. Nevada also needs large-scale solar to meet its 50% renewable energy goal by 2030. It currently generates 20%. Yet greens grouse that solar arrays would disturb habitat for Mojave Desert species such as the desert tortoise, kit fox and the Threecorner milkvetch, a rare plant. They also complain that solar projects in California’s desert have been linked to thousands of bird deaths. BLM’s review details myriad measures to mitigate harm to species, including a biological monitor. Still, greens kvetch that the project will do permanent damage to the desert. “There is no justification for this project that outweighs the importance of the desert tortoise, its habitat and BLM’s obligations to use its full authority to take actions that will contribute to the recovery of this threatened species,” the Defenders of Wildlife declared. It’s nice to see environmental groups finally realizing that renewable energy isn’t a free lunch. Even wind and solar energy can have baleful impacts on the land. Lithium and other rare earth minerals in batteries must also be extracted from the earth, which in countries with lax environmental regulation like China can result in water pollution.  "

Finally, after multiple attacks on U.S. bases and allies, President Trump approved a military response against Iranian-allied militias in Iraq and Syria on the weekend. Mr. Trump has to be prepared to do more if the Iranians decide to escalate. The Pentagon said U.S. F-15E fighters carried out the strikes on five targets occupied by Kataib Hezbollah, a Shiite militia allied with and armed by Iran. “Iran and their KH proxy forces must cease their attacks on U.S. and coalition forces, and respect Iraq’s sovereignty, to prevent additional defensive actions by U.S. forces,” Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said. Kataib Hezbollah is a proxy arm of Iranian general Qasem Soleimani’s Quds Force and would not have acted against U.S. forces without his approval. The group is responsible for 11 rocket attacks in two months on bases where American soldiers were present. A Kataib Hezbollah attack on Friday on an Iraqi base near Kirkuk killed a U.S. contractor and wounded four American troops. Had Mr. Trump not responded to these U.S. casualties, he would have invited even more attacks. Mr. Trump’s reluctance to use force in response to previous Iranian attacks is one reason Gen. Soleimani may feel he can get away with more attacks. Last June Mr. Trump stunned his own advisers when he called off a U.S. retaliatory strike on Iran at the last minute after Iran shot down a U.S. drone. Mr. Trump also declined to act after Iran’s brazen September attack on Saudi oil facilities.  "

The company’s designers until recently could choose from about 150 types of red when making Barbie dolls, Hot Wheels cars or other toys in its stable. Ink types from glossy to waterproof multiplied the options. Each variation added storage costs and downtime at factories for cleaning equipment to swap out shades. “Complexity is really a killer,” said Roberto Isaias, Mattel’s chief supply-chain officer. Mattel has chopped the choices of reds by more than one-third and is doing the same for other colors, part of a broad edict to simplify the company’s supply chain. The change is one of dozens of projects undertaken at the toy maker since Chief Executive Ynon Kreiz took over in 2018 to improve operations and cut hundreds of millions of dollars in costs. The goal is to improve, modernize and ultimately tame a sprawling supply chain that operates 13 factories, employs as many as 35,000 people during peak periods and delivers toys to 375,000 retail locations world-wide. Mr. Kreiz wants to close, consolidate or sell some plants and remake Mattel into a toy manufacturer that can more quickly churn out products and capitalize on trends.  "

And (Trump’s) going to get away. You guys buy into it all the time. Not a joke . . . Think what it’s about. It’s all about what he does all the time, his entire career. Take the focus off. This guy violated the Constitution. He said it in the driveway of the White House. He acknowledged he asked for help.” Mull that one over. The House has impeached Mr. Trump in one of its articles for going to court to fight its subpoenas. But at least the President is defending his constitutional authority under the separation of powers. Mr. Biden claims he can ignore a Senate subpoena on his own judgment because he says the press corps will report on his appearance and change the focus from Mr. Trump. But Mr. Trump’s defense against impeachment includes that he had the right to ask Ukraine, as a recipient of U.S. aid, to investigate alleged corruption by Mr. Biden and his son Hunter. Mr. Biden tried to modify his comments a day later, but he only made it worse. “I want to clarify something I said yesterday. In my 40 years in public life, I have always complied with a lawful order and in my eight years as VP, my office—unlike Donald Trump and Mike Pence—cooperated with legitimate congressional oversight requests,” Mr. Biden wrote on  Twitter .  “But I am just not going to pretend that there is any legal basis for Republican subpoenas for my testimony in the impeachment trial.”  "

I have just emailed the statement to the administration. It reads as follows: “Although I am aware and respectful of the many dimensions within which a university properly seeks a diverse faculty and student body, I have long been particularly concerned with the lack of intellectual diversity at the law school. A survey of U.S. law professors in general found that white Democratic professors (both male and female), Jewish professors, and nonreligious professors ‘account for most (or all) of the overrepresentation among racial, gender, religious, and ideological groups in law teaching.’ The groups that ‘account for most of the underrepresentation among racial, gender, religious, and ideological groups in law teaching’ are Republicans (both male and female), Protestants, and Catholics. This disparity persists even though ‘religious and political diversity are probably more important for viewpoint diversity than gender diversity and roughly as important as racial diversity.’ “At UCLA, we know that the campus as a whole leans substantially to the left. ‘A study of various university faculties showed that at Cornell the ratio of liberal to conservative faculty members was 166 to 6, at Stanford it was 151 to 17, at UCLA it was 141 to 9, and at the University of Colorado it was 116 to 5.’ Conservative students at UCLA have been ‘harassed, stalked, and threatened.’ I recently searched the opensecrets.org donor database for political contributions made by persons who claimed UCLA School of Law as their employer. Thirty-eight of those persons contributed solely to Democratic candidates, the Democratic Party and various affiliates, and liberal PACs. One person contributed to both Republicans and Democrats. Three persons contributed exclusively to Republican candidates, the Republican Party, and various . . . affiliates. Of the faculty members who contributed exclusively to Republican candidates, the most recently hired of the two was hired in 1997. As a monetary matter, 92.67% of all contributions went to Democrats and affiliated groups.  "

Think again. The new production created by William Kentridge and conducted by Yannick Nézet-Séguin that opened at the Metropolitan Opera on Friday is rich, expansive and revelatory on stage and in the pit. Director and conductor opened up this grim tale of a mistreated soldier, giving its themes a larger canvas and finding heart-stopping beauty in its bleakness. Berg adapted his libretto from Georg Büchner’s play “Woyzeck,” which he saw at its Vienna premiere in 1914. (The play, left unfinished when Büchner died in 1837, was discovered in 1875, edited, and finally staged in 1913.) In 15 brief scenes, interspersed with orchestral interludes, it recounts the downfall of the impoverished Wozzeck. Taunted by his Captain and experimented on by the unscrupulous Doctor while Marie, his girlfriend and mother of his child, dallies with the handsome Drum-Major, Wozzeck has terrifying apocalyptic visions. Ground down by humiliation and fear, he murders Marie and then drowns himself. The opera usually takes place in Germany around 1821, the time of the real-life events that inspired the story. Mr. Kentridge has set it just before World War I, making Wozzeck’s visions and the cruelty surrounding him reflect the disintegration of the world order. Sabine Theunissen’s set and Catherine Meyburgh’s projections, ominously lighted by Urs Schönebaum, act like an art installation. Live characters gingerly navigate a rickety pile of platforms, connected by duckboards that suggest the trenches of France. Piled-up wooden chairs are repurposed as weapons or firewood. Wozzeck and Marie’s child is a puppet wearing a gas mask. An actor wearing a field nurse’s apron and a gas mask and carrying a crutch opens the armoire where the Doctor’s experiments take place; in the final scene, the crutch becomes the child’s hobbyhorse. The cyclorama backdrop and a projection screen that is part of the built set are canvases for Mr. Kentridge’s instantly recognizable black-and-white drawings, rendered in smudgy charcoal and subtly animated so that, for example, giant heads slowly appear on a battlefield as Wozzeck hallucinates them, and figures, including a horse and a pompous officer, strut by. There are blasted towns, barbed wire, a dirigible, a crashed plane, exploding shells and battlefield maps. The images are often suggestive rather than explicit—as when two dancing shadows turn out to be running soldiers who fall after being shot—making the installation’s evocation of chaos and overwhelming dread even stronger.

The reform effort looks smart on paper, but success will depend on how serious Beijing is in liberalizing its markets. The country’s legislature approved some major changes to its securities laws, after more than four years of discussions. The revisions, which take effect in March, will put in place a new system for public share listings that is more in line with developed markets. Currently, China’s market regulator vets each initial public offering thoroughly, resulting in a logjam of applications: more than 400 companies are waiting to be listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen, leading to waiting periods that can last for years. Among other things, companies must demonstrate to regulators that they can be sustainably profitable. In contrast, the new registration-based system would rely more on accurate and transparent disclosure, allowing investors the freedom and responsibility to weigh the risks and make their own decisions. The revised legislation will also raise penalties for securities fraud to compensate for the hands-off approach of approving IPOs. China’s regulator said the change will be made step by step: it will likely start with ChiNext, a board housing some of the smaller and more speculative stocks. China has already experimented with such a system in its newly created STAR board, its answer to Nasdaq. That seems to have worked well, at least in terms of attracting new listings. Around a third of new listings in mainland China this year came from this board, which brought total listing volume to the highest since 2011, according to Dealogic. Only investors with at least 500,000 yuan ($71,600) of net assets and two years of trading experience are allowed to trade on the STAR board. Rolling out the new regulatory regime to the broader market will help speed up the IPO process. That will add an important funding channel for many struggling private Chinese companies: Corporate bond defaults rose 17% to hit a record 141.9 billion yuan this year, according to Wind.  "

Mr. Trump faces no significant Republican challenger, putting him at a campaign finance advantage over the many Democrats vying for their party’s nomination in a highly competitive and costly primary. Although Mr. Trump is expected to have raised more than any single Democrat last quarter, together those candidates will at least double his haul but are expected to have much less cash on hand. Where do you expect President Trump’s campaign to focus its resources? Where would you like to see them allocated? Join the conversation below. Trump campaign manager            Brad Parscale      said that this was the president’s biggest fundraising quarter during the 2020 campaign cycle, calling him “an unstoppable juggernaut.” Over the full year, the president’s campaign raised a total of $143 million and had $102.7 million in the bank at the end of 2019. Presidential campaigns must report fourth-quarter fundraising information to the Federal Election Commission by Jan. 31. Mr. Trump’s fundraising tops the numbers that have been announced by Democratic presidential hopefuls. Sen. Bernie Sanders,      of Vermont, brought in $34.5 million in the final quarter of the year, according to his campaign, and former South Bend, Ind., Mayor            Pete Buttigieg      said he raised $24.7 million. Former Vice President      Joe Biden            said his campaign raised $22.7 million. None of the candidates released updated cash on hand numbers. Some candidates haven’t released any numbers yet. The president also works closely with the Republican National Committee to raise money, and the figures reported by the Trump campaign don’t include the RNC’s latest finances. Mr. Trump gave himself an advantage by kicking off his re-election the day he was inaugurated. While recent presidents typically have waited until their third year in office to return to the campaign trail, Mr. Trump immediately arranged to fundraise for re-election and never stopped holding the large political rallies that helped him win office in 2016. Sitting presidents almost always enjoy strong fundraising for re-election. Former President            Barack Obama      raised about $40 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, and former President            George W. Bush      raised $47.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2003, according to Federal Election Commission reports. Mr. Bush’s campaign had almost $100 million in available cash at the start of his re-election year, the FEC reports show. An advantage of incumbency is that Mr. Trump has been able to solicit maximum $360,600 donations from individuals, circumventing the far lower $2,800-per-donor cap now in place for the Democratic hopefuls. Those large checks are spread among Mr. Trump’s fundraising partners, the RNC and state-level Republican parties. The eventual Democratic nominee also will be able to create a bigger-ticket fundraising program, but Mr. Trump has been benefiting from his arrangement for almost three years already.

It was the first death of the outbreak in the city of Wuhan, where 59 people have been quarantined. Chinese scientists discovered a new strain of coronavirus there this week. Preliminary investigations found that 41 people in the city of Wuhan had been infected with the strain, the city’s health commission said. It said there were no infections found among people in close contact with the infected patients—including medical workers—suggesting that it isn’t easily transmittable between humans. The man who died had been admitted to the hospital with respiratory failure and pneumonia, the health commission said, and had other health conditions. Seven people quarantined in the viral-pneumonia outbreak are in critical condition and eight have been released, the health commission said. Two of those eight people are confirmed to have been infected with the new coronavirus, according to the commission. No new cases have been reported since Jan. 3.  "

Cerner was interviewing Silicon Valley giants to pick a storage provider for 250 million health records, one of the largest collections of U.S. patient data. Google dispatched former chief executive Eric Schmidt to personally pitch Cerner over several phone calls and offered around $250 million in discounts and incentives, people familiar with the matter say. Google had a bigger goal in pushing for the deal than dollars and cents: a way to expand its effort to collect, analyze and aggregate health data on millions of Americans. Google representatives were vague in answering questions about how Cerner’s data would be used, making the health-care company’s executives wary, the people say. Eventually, Cerner struck a storage deal with  Amazon.com Inc.  instead. The failed Cerner deal reveals an emerging challenge to Google’s move into health care: gaining the trust of health care partners and the public. So far, that has hardly slowed the search giant. Google has struck partnerships with some of the country’s largest hospital systems and most-renowned health-care providers, many of them vast in scope and few of their details previously reported. In just a few years, the company has achieved the ability to view or analyze tens of millions of patient health records in at least three-quarters of U.S. states, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of contractual agreements.

Slowing population growth will have significant economic and social implications for the country, but especially for high-tax states. The Census Bureau and IRS last week also released state population growth and income migration data for 2018 that show the exodus from high-tax to low-tax states is accelerating. Four states have lost population since 2010 including West Virginia (-3.3%), Illinois (-1.2%), Vermont (-0.3%) and Connecticut (-0.2%), but 10 experienced declines last year. New York was the biggest loser as a net 180,000 people left for better climes. Over the last decade New York has lost more of its population to other states (7.2%) than any other save Alaska (8%), followed by Illinois (6.8%), Connecticut (5.6%) and New Jersey (5.5%). Hmmm, what do these states have in common? Large tax burdens and politically powerful public unions. Illinois’s property tax rates are the second highest in the country after New Jersey. The state lost $5.6 billion in adjusted gross income last year to other states, about twice as much as in 2012. Notably, income outflow hasn’t increased from Michigan or Wisconsin. Illinois’s 4.95% flat income tax is lower than many of its neighbors, but Democrats are pushing a state constitutional amendment on the November ballot for a progressive income tax. Voters should look how that’s turned out for other high-tax states. New York’s 12.7% top marginal rate is the second highest in the U.S. In the last two years New York has lost a net $18 billion in adjusted gross income. The wealth exodus is reducing revenue and making it harder to fund programs like Medicaid. As Gov. Andrew Cuomo groused last year, “Tax the rich, tax the rich, tax the rich. We did that. God forbid the rich leave.”  "

While Tesla and GE couldn’t be more different, they are exemplars of two trends driving the rising number of loss makers. Tesla shows a desire by investors to back disruptive companies as they build their sales. GE represents a growing number of companies struggling to make money from traditional businesses—although GE bucks a third trend, which is that many of the unloved losers are small companies being squeezed by the growth of giant corporations. The combination of forces has pushed the percentage of listed companies in the U.S. losing money over 12 months to close to 40%, its highest level since the late 1990s outside of postrecession periods. This time there’s no recession, and stock market indexes are at or near record highs. That sounds scary, although it’s mainly worrying for investors in smaller companies. Tesla is the biggest of the loss makers investors like; although it posted a rare profit in the most-recent quarter, it has lost money over 12 months. With a market value of $89 billion, it is worth more than  Ford  and  General Motors  put together despite only four prior quarters of profit in its 12-year life.  "

Facebook’s stance—that companies shouldn’t decide how campaigns are able to reach voters—is at odds with other tech firms’ approach to handling political advertising in the run-up to the 2020 election. Operators of online platforms are under increasing pressure to curb the spread of misleading or false information in the wake of the 2016 presidential campaign, which U.S. intelligence agencies have said was subject to foreign meddling online. Facebook’s announcement Thursday highlighted the divide in opinion on what the company’s role should be in elections, as critics—including some Democratic presidential candidates—said the latest decision leaves the door wide open for disinformation. Facebook has acknowledged that the spread of disinformation, including through targeted ads, is a problem and has expressed a desire for federal regulation of political advertising online. But its announcement in September that it would exempt politicians’ and certain other ads from its third-party fact-checking program fed skepticism about its commitment to combating disinformation on its platform.

The novel coronavirus was genetically sequenced from a sample from one patient and subsequently found in some of the others affected in the city of Wuhan, people familiar with the findings said. Chinese authorities haven’t concluded that the strain is the underlying cause of sickness in all the patients who have been isolated in Wuhan since the infection first broke out in early December, the people said. Chinese state media reported Thursday that the unidentified pneumonia “is believed to be a new type of coronavirus,” citing experts. State media reported that the results were preliminary and more research was needed to understand the virus. There are many known coronaviruses—some can cause ailments like common colds in humans, while others don’t affect humans at all. Some—such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS-coronavirus, identified in 2003—have led to deadly outbreaks, lending urgency to efforts to contain the current situation. The number of reported cases of viral pneumonia in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, was 59 on Sunday, rising from 27 on Dec. 31, according to Wuhan’s Municipal Health Commission, with seven people in critical condition. No deaths have been reported.  "

But the report is an exception to other strong recent labor data, and the big picture is that the longest hiring expansion in 80 years is lifting lower-income workers in particular as accumulating evidence shows. The jobless rate remained steady at 3.5% as labor participation held at its recent high of 63.2%. The 145,000 new jobs are fewer than the 184,000 average monthly gains over the last three months and the 165,000 average over the past year. Most of the slowdown appears to be trade-related and reflects lower business investment. Wage growth for production-level workers slowed with average hourly wages up 3% over the last year compared to 3.4% in November. Some of this may be monthly statistical noise, and the trend in the last two years has been higher wage growth among lower earners. That’s a contrast to the early years of this expansion when real wages were flat. The Federal Reserve’s interventions inflated asset values, which helped the affluent but did little for low- and middle-income Americans who don’t own stocks. Enter Donald Trump, whose deregulation and tax reform unleashed a surge of business investment (before his tariff spree) and hiring, which has drawn workers off the sidelines and raised wages. The comparative data are striking, and mostly ignored by the press. During the first 11 quarters of the Trump Presidency, wages for the bottom 10% of earners over age 25 rose an average 5.9% annually compared to 2.4% during Barack Obama’s second term, according to the latest demographic data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Wages for the middle two quartiles increased 3.2% compared to 2.2% and 2.7% between 2012 and 2016. Wage gains for the top 10% have held steady at about 3%.  "

The hospital and health-insurance company, based in Oakland, Calif., said the rehab program, in which patients participate remotely, is showing promising results. Kaiser is betting on remote monitoring via wearables to cut costs in areas such as hospital readmissions. More than 2,300 patients recovering from a cardiac event enrolled in the remote eight-week rehab program between June 2018 and June 2019, according to a paper published in NEJM Catalyst. More than 87% of the patients completed it, compared with less than 50% on average for Kaiser’s in-clinic rehab programs, the company said.  Readmission rates based on cardiac-related conditions in the remote program were less than 2% through June 2019, compared with 10% to 15% on average for in-clinic programs. The program, which started in Southern California, has continued since June 2019 and is expanding to more states. The patients have been wearing            Samsung Electronics Co.      smartwatches supplied by Kaiser for the duration of the program. Users receive reminders on the smartwatch to do things such as work out or take medication. A mobile app accessible through the smartwatch includes a questionnaire where patients provide details including the type and duration of exercise and whether they experienced any symptoms. The watch collects additional data such as steps and pulse. The program supplied around 4,000 Samsung smartwatches to patients by the end of 2019. In 2020, the company expects to add about 5,000 patients who suffered cardiac events, which include heart attacks, bypass surgery and heart failure. Kaiser Permanente also is talking to companies such as            Apple Inc.,      whose Apple Watch has apps to monitor and notify patients of irregular heart rhythm. “We see that as an opportunity and an area that we need to continue to monitor and determine which devices have the right efficacy so that we can rely on the data,” said            Dick Daniels,      chief information officer at Kaiser Permanente. Pilot projects involving health-care wearables for remote monitoring have been deployed by a third of 100 health-care providers surveyed by Spyglass Consulting Group, according to a study released in October. Technology companies, meanwhile, are looking to expand in the health-care market. Google recently acquired Fitbit Inc., which has a wearables program for health providers. The Food and Drug Administration is working with sellers of wearables, including Apple and Samsung, to streamline approval of mobile medical apps. Concerns about the accuracy and security of data collected by wearables has led to resistance from some health-care providers in using the devices. A study by Stanford University published in March found that the pulse sensor in the Apple Watch helped detect a heart-rhythm disorder in some users but may have caused false alarms for others. In Kaiser’s virtual-rehab program, data collected by wearable sensors play a supporting role to the app the patients use. Kaiser and Samsung worked together to customize a version of Samsung’s HeartWise app to remind patients of program goals and deliver their responses to physicians. The program includes exercise regimens, counseling and other steps to improve a patient’s health and lifestyle. “This one is not continuous monitoring. But it’s almost as though somebody’s calling you every day, all the time, to see what’s going on,” said            Tad Funahashi,      Kaiser’s chief innovation and transformation officer for Southern California, who led the program’s development. If a patient isn’t meeting obligations, such as failing to exercise for a specific amount of time, health-care providers can follow up with phone calls or during in-clinic sessions. The alerts are triggered by information provided by the user. Data including step counts and heart rate to check exertion are available to doctors or nurses through a dashboard on Kaiser’s system so they can review and adjust the rehabilitation program.

In the days that followed, the White House and Iranian leaders exchanged further messages, which officials in both countries described as far more measured than the fiery rhetoric traded publicly by politicians. A week later, and after a retaliatory Iranian missile attack on two military bases hosting American troops that inflicted no casualties, Washington and Tehran seemed to be stepping back from the brink of open hostilities—for now. “We don’t communicate with the Iranians that much, but when we do the Swiss have played a critical role to convey messages and avoid miscalculation,” a senior U.S. official said.

Unlike THC, the compound in marijuana that imparts a “high,” CBD isn’t psychoactive.

Some mainstream companies looking into drinks and snacks containing CBD are slowing that work.  PepsiCo Inc.  and  Starbucks Corp.  held discussions about drinks containing CBD, according to food scientists and consultants familiar with the matter.  Kellogg Co.  was looking at adding CBD in its Rxbar protein bars, said an executive familiar with that work.  Monster Beverage Corp.  and Red Bull have considered CBD drinks, consultants involved in those discussions said.  "

But more investors than before aren’t content to play it that safe. They’re using options to make riskier bets, speculating on near-term movements in individual stocks and funds. Since the year 2000, while stock-market trading volume has more than doubled, stock-options volume has grown to more than six times what it was then, at around 4.4 billion options contracts in 2019, according to Options Clearing Corp. At online brokers  TD Ameritrade Holding Corp.  and  E*Trade Financial Corp. , options have risen from less than 10% of daily trades a decade ago to sometimes 30% or more in recent years, according to estimates by investment bank Sandler O’Neill + Partners. Options contracts give the holder either the right to buy or the right to sell a set number of shares, usually 100, at a given price within a given period, usually a few weeks or months. An investor can buy or sell a call option, which confers the right to buy shares, or a put option, the right to sell shares. Options can be used conservatively to hedge against declines in an investor’s share holdings, but they are also powerful speculative instruments. For instance, the buyer of a call option can capture all the upside of a given stock for just a small percentage of the stock’s price. But investors also can get burned. One common path to losses is selling unhedged calls or puts that blow up when a stock moves sharply the wrong way. “It really is a form of gambling,” says Robert Lowry, a former Securities and Exchange Commission regulator who conducted examinations of broker-dealers for the agency and now serves as an expert witness for investors in arbitration cases against brokers.

The drop is largely driven by progress against lung cancer, though the most rapid declines in the report occurred in melanoma. Advances in treatment are helping improve survival rates in the two cancers, experts say. Falling smoking rates have played a big role in the decline in lung-cancer deaths, cancer doctors say, as well as improvements in detection and treatment. For melanoma, the report singles out the emergence of drugs like  Roche Holding AG’s  Zelboraf that target the molecular roots of tumors and therapies like Yervoy from  Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. , which enlist a patient’s own immune system in the cancer fight. Roche, Bristol and other drug makers have spent tens of billions of dollars in recent years developing new therapies such as Zelboraf, Yervoy and new generations of the treatments. The $123 billion world-wide cancer drugs market is among the industry’s biggest and fastest growing, which has prompted companies to double down on their research and promises even more agents that could make a dent against tumors. “Our work with personalized medicines, such as Zelboraf, deepens our understanding of the underlying biology of cancer,” said a spokesperson for Genentech, one of the companies that developed Zelboraf and is owned by Roche. “We are continually building up this knowledge to help more people across many different types of cancer.”  "

This took place despite Donald Trump’s relative unpopularity and polarizing style. When Gallup began asking the question in 1992, 17% of Americans said they were liberal, with 36% identifying as conservative and 43% as moderate. The share of liberals has since steadily increased at the expense of moderates, peaking at 26% in 2017. It stayed there in 2018 then declined to 24% in 2019. The share of conservatives ticked up from 35% to 37%. The change is modest but bears watching. It could be a blip on the way to a center-left America or the beginning of the end of a generational leftward drift that accelerated under Barack Obama’s presidency. The most dramatic ideological change has unfolded within the Democratic Party. In 1994, according to Gallup, a quarter of Democratic voters said they were liberal. That surged to more than half by 2018.  "

Millions of people use virtual assistants that listen for wake words and record what follows. More airports are using facial recognition to speed up travel. And, at least in San Francisco, being followed around by cameras in a cashierless store isn’t really creepy anymore, just a regular part of grabbing lunch. This kind of sensing is appearing in more places. Take for example, Eyeris, a technology that combines cameras, radar and infrared sensors to know what’s going on in a vehicle. “Cars can be much, much safer than they are today,” said Modar Alaoui, chief executive officer of Eyeris. The potential applications of the technology are simultaneously amazing and disconcerting. Object detection could mean knowing you’re about to leave your keys or your bag in an Uber. Face and body analytics will enable automatic adjustment of a steering wheel to just the right position, or the deployment of a size-appropriate air bag, depending on who Is in a given seat. Activity, cognition and emotion analytics systems will be able to detect if you are eating, texting or looking away from the road for too long, so that the car can respond accordingly. If a child is screaming in the back seat, calming music could be cued up. And if you seem distracted, some of the cars autopilot features might kick in to assist you.  "

Rockefeller and three partners. Such was their drive and ruthlessness that within a decade Standard Oil became a vast monopoly, controlling over 90% of America’s oil refineries. By 1913 Rockefeller was worth $900 million, the equivalent of $23.6 billion today. Standard Oil’s tentacle-like grip on U.S. commerce was finally prized loose in 1911, when the Supreme Court broke it up into 33 separate companies. But this victory didn’t put an end to the nefarious activities surrounding “black gold.” In the 1920s, tycoon Edward Doheny was drawn into the Teapot Dome scandal after he gave a $100,000 bribe to Secretary of the Interior Albert Fall. Doheny served as the inspiration for the corrupt and blood-soaked tycoon J. Arnold Ross in Upton Sinclair’s 1927 novel “Oil!” (which in turned inspired the Oscar-winning 2007 film “There Will Be Blood”). Though clearly responsible for a great many evils, oil has also been key to the growth of human civilization. As the Bible attests, bitumen—a naturally forming liquid found in oil sands and pitch lakes—was used in ancient times for waterproofing boats and baskets. It also played an important role in Egyptian burial practices: The word “mummy” is derived from mumiyyah, the Arabic word for bitumen. Over the centuries, oil proved useful in a variety of ways. As early as the fourth century, the Chinese were drilling for oil with bamboo pipes and burning it as heating fuel. In Central Eurasia it was a treatment for mange in camels. By the ninth century, Persian alchemists had discovered how to distill oil into kerosene to make light. The oil fields of medieval Baku, in today’s Azerbaijan, brought trade and culture to the region, rather than political oppression and underdevelopment, as is often the case in oil-rich countries today. The drilling of the first commercial oil well in the U.S., in Pennsylvania in 1859, brought a raft of benefits. In the 19th century, an estimated 236,000 sperm whales were killed to make oil for lamps. The whaling industry died overnight once Standard Oil began marketing a clean-smelling version of kerosene. Plentiful oil also made the automobile industry possible. In 1901, when a massive oil gusher was discovered in Spindletop, Texas, there were 14,800 cars in the U.S.; two decades later, there were 8.5 million.  "

Nearly half of Generation X physicians who were surveyed said they felt burned out, compared with 39% of baby boomers, ages 55 to 73, and 38% of millennials, ages 25 to 39. Roughly half of all the doctors surveyed also said that they would be willing to take a substantial pay cut to achieve a better work-life balance. Share of doctors burned out by generation... 0 10 20 30 40 50% Millennial Gen X Boomer ...and by gender Women Men Top contributors to burnout Too many bureaucratic tasks (i.e. charting, paperwork) Millennial 57% Generation X 56 54 Boomer Spending too many hours at work 38 33 31 Lack of respect from administrators/ employers, colleagues or staff 35 33 30 Increasing computerization of practice 17 28 41 Note: Survey of 15,181 physicians conducted June 15-Sept. 19, 2019; margin of error: +/-0.8 percentage points. Source: Medscape Burnout is often described as long-term, unresolved, work-related stress that leads to cynicism, detachment, exhaustion and lack of a sense of personal accomplishment. Burnout can occur in any profession, especially those that are high-stress, such as lawyers or emergency services. A 2018 Gallup poll of 7,500 full-time employees found that 23% of employees reported being burned out at work very often or always, and 44% reported feeling burned out sometimes. Burnout is particularly pervasive among health-care workers, such as physicians or nurses, researchers say. Risk for burnout among physicians is significantly greater than that of general U.S. working adults, and physicians also report being less satisfied with their work-life balance, according to a 2019 study published in Mayo Clinic Proceedings. Overall, 42% of the physicians in the new survey, across 29 specialties, reported feeling some sense of burnout, down slightly from 46% in 2015. The report, published on Wednesday by medical-information platform Medscape, breaks down the generational differences in burnout and how doctors cope with the symptoms that are widespread throughout the profession. “There are a lot more similarities than differences, and what that highlights is that burnout in medicine right now is really an entire-profession problem,” said            Colin West,      a professor of medicine at the Mayo Clinic who researches physician well-being. “There’s really no age group, career stage, gender or specialty that’s immune from these issues.” In recent years, hospitals, health systems and advocacy groups have tried to curb the problem by starting wellness programs, hiring chief wellness officers or attempting to reduce administrative tasks for nurses and physicians. Still, high rates of burnout persist among the medical community, from medical-school students to seasoned professionals, and more than two-thirds of all physicians surveyed in the Medscape report said that burnout had an impact on their personal relationships. Nearly one in five physicians also reported that they are depressed, with the highest rate, 18%, reported by Gen Xers. The stage of a doctor’s career might account for much of the age-related differences, rather than something inherently generational, say researchers who study physician well-being. Generation X doctors are at a pivotal point in their professional and personal lives, and the heightened pressures or desire for a career shift might contribute to their increased levels of burnout. They are simultaneously up for promotions at work or figuring out the next step in their career path, as well as potentially raising children at home or caring for older parents, all while continuing to practice medicine. “The Gen Xers are in the prime of their professional careers, at their busiest and perhaps most stressed point, and perhaps with more family competing pressures than younger physicians,” said            Gary Price,      the president of the Physicians Foundation, a nonprofit group that advocates for physicians. Women physicians, who make up a greater portion of the younger generations, also face higher rates of burnout. Though the exact reason for the disparity isn’t clear, several societal factors, including time spent on domestic responsibilities, discrimination and harassment, likely play a role, Dr. West said. Some 55% of physicians reported that administrative tasks are the main driver of burnout, and spending too many hours at work was also a top contributor across the board. But millennial and Gen X doctors also cited a lack of respect from administrators, employers or colleagues as a top concern, while boomers highlighted increased computerization and electronic medical records.  Get an early-morning briefing about the coronavirus each weekday and a weekly Health newsletter when the crisis abates. The boomers “were the ones that saw the big change from paper charts,” said            Leslie Kane,      the senior director of Medscape’s Business of Medicine site. Because of the shift to electronic health records, doctors often note spending less time communicating with patients, a change that boomers would also notice more acutely, she said. But while millennials are more satisfied with electronic medical records than previous generations, most of them are still dissatisfied with the system, said            Tait Shanafelt,      chief wellness officer at Stanford Medicine and director of its WellMD Center. “That group, as much as anyone, says, ‘Why can’t this be like my iPhone?’ ” said Dr. Shanafelt. “I think they navigate it better, but they still recognize its inefficiencies.” The majority of millennial doctors said that they coped by sleeping or talking with family members and friends, but the top two responses from Gen X or boomers were exercise and isolating themselves from others.

The eight-part agreement acts as a cease-fire in a two-year trade war that has roiled markets world-wide and cut into global growth. But it leaves in place U.S. tariffs on about $370 billion in Chinese goods, or about three-quarters of Chinese imports to the U.S. Possible tariff reductions will be left to later negotiations, which will cover a host of difficult issues at the heart of the trade battle, including Chinese subsidies to domestic companies and Beijing’s oversight of Chinese state-owned firms. Those talks are expected to begin fairly soon but not conclude until after the U.S. presidential election in November. Speaking to a packed audience of business and political leaders in the East Room of the White House, President Trump said the remaining tariffs “will all come off” if the talks produce a second agreement. He called the deal a “momentous step—one that has never been taken before with China—toward a future of fair and reciprocal trade.” Vice Premier Liu He of China, who signed the agreement for Beijing, played up the need for both countries to act together to tackle challenges such as terrorism, aging and environmental protection.

To wit, he has assumed a role as self-styled conscience of the business world in telling CEOs how to run their companies. “We believe that sustainability should be our new standard for investing,” he wrote to clients in his annual letter this week. He added that “all investors—and particularly the millions of our clients who are saving for long-term goals like retirement—must seriously consider sustainability in their investments.” Mr. Fink gets attention because BlackRock is the world’s largest asset manager, with some $7.43 trillion in client assets. He is now threatening to vote against corporate directors and management if they don’t do what he says, and he is especially exercised about climate change. He is demanding that companies disclose climate risks, and wants to see their plans to operate under scenarios in which warming is limited to fewer than two degrees Celsius this century. Corporations in which BlackRock invests will also have to comply with the rules from a “Sustainability Accounting Standards Board” on issues such as labor practices and workforce diversity. “Disclosure should be a means to achieving a more sustainable and inclusive capitalism,” Mr. Fink writes. Like his friends at the Business Roundtable, Mr. Fink is big on “stakeholder” capitalism. “Each company’s prospects for growth are inextricable from its ability to operate sustainably and serve its full set of stakeholders,” he says. If he means serving employees, customers, suppliers and communities, he is merely saying what any successful company already does. But our guess is that by stakeholders Mr. Fink really means regulators and politicians. The giveaway is that Mr. Fink says BlackRock will divest its actively managed funds from corporations that generate 25% or more of their revenues from coal production. “We don’t yet know which predictions about the climate will be most accurate,” Mr. Fink acknowledges, but “even if only a fraction of the projected impacts is realized, this is a much more structural, long-term crisis.” He might be right, but then estimates of future temperature increases are based on climate models that have overstated warming to date. Mr. Fink wants to make corporations plan for unknown temperature increases as well as climate regulations that are even less certain. Coal is an easy target since its share of American power is declining. But the International Energy Agency projects that oil and coal demand will stay flat through 2040 and natural gas consumption will increase 40% even if all countries keep the promises they made in the 2015 nonbinding Paris climate accord. The U.S. is predicted to account for 85% of the increase in global oil production over the next decade thanks to shale drilling. All of which means that fossil fuels still have a long shelf life, especially in developing countries. There are 170 gigawatts of coal-plant capacity under construction across the world, which is more than what currently exists in Europe. So what happens if Mr. Fink’s political and climate predictions prove wrong? His clients will pay the price. BlackRock is a fiduciary and as such is legally obligated to act in its clients’ best interest. This is ostensibly why BlackRock has voted against more than 80% of the climate resolutions on proxy ballots by activist shareholders. But suddenly Mr. Fink is prioritizing the interests of liberal politicians and pressure groups. We can’t help but wonder if Mr. Fink, after a profitable life in business, is auditioning to be Treasury Secretary in, say, the Warren Presidency. His “stakeholder” notions sound similar to her plans to put American corporations further under the government’s thumb. CEOs who take Mr. Fink seriously might note that his political and moral importuning isn’t satisfying progressives. “BlackRock will continue to be the world’s largest investor in coal, oil and gas,” the Sierra Club said in response to Mr. Fink’s letter. Businesses will never be able to appease the climate absolutists. The best way they can prepare for climate risks and serve their stakeholders is to succeed as a business and create the wealth and broad prosperity that will make the world better able to adapt to whatever happens. That’s real “sustainablility.” Copyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 87990cbe856818d5eddac44c7b1cdeb8 Appeared in the January 18, 2020, print edition as '.'

Congress authorized the damming of the Colorado River in 1928, construction started in 1931, and the 726-foot concrete wonder opened in 1936. That’s a “shovel ready” job. Today even modest public works, including roads, bridges and airport runways, can spend years in limbo, no thanks to the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA. That 1970 law requires an environmental study of any major project that involves federal funding or permitting. NEPA hasn’t been overhauled in 40 years, which is why the Trump Administration deserves applause for moving last week to modernize it. Everybody wants to protect the environment. But NEPA isn’t doing the job sensibly. No single agency has responsibility for its enforcement, unlike the Clean Water Act or the Clean Air Act. There’s no obligation for the feds to keep a specific timeline. Environmental assessments and impact statements are often monstrously detailed, since agencies and sponsors are trying to make them litigation proof. The result is a regulatory morass. From 2013 to 2017, the average final impact statement took more than four years and ran 669 pages, the Council on Environmental Quality said last summer. The longest file was for a contentious 12-mile expansion of Interstate 70 in Denver. The final report ran 8,951 pages, plus another 7,307 pages of appendices. The whole rigmarole took 13 years. That kills time, wastes taxpayer money, discourages development, and makes the government opaque to people without lawyers on retainer. Even bureaucrats don’t examine all this stuff. As Interior Secretary David Bernhardt said on a call with reporters: “When I asked our senior managers if they were reading these documents that were several thousand pages long, they said, emphatically, no.”  "

More consumers over the past decade have been using financial-services apps to manage their savings and spending, and Plaid sits in the middle of those relationships, providing software that gives the apps access to financial accounts. Venmo,  PayPal Holdings Inc.’s  money-transfer service, is one of privately held Plaid’s biggest customers. Visa is the largest U.S. card network, handling $3.4 trillion of credit, debit and prepaid-card transactions in the first nine months of 2019, according to the Nilson Report. Its clients are largely comprised of banks that issue credit and debit cards, but the company is looking to expand its presence in the burgeoning field of electronic payments, where trillions of dollars are sent by wire transfer or between bank accounts globally each year. On an investor conference call following the Monday announcement, Visa Chief Executive Al Kelly said the acquisition would help expand the company’s access to financial-technology firms while accelerating its movement outside of cards. The deal was reported earlier Monday by The Wall Street Journal. Visa last year acquired control of Earthport, which provides cross-border payment services to banks and businesses, after rival  Mastercard Inc.  also made an offer for the company. Before that, Mastercard bought payment-technology firm Vocalink, which enables the movement of payments between bank accounts.  "

The  Alphabet Inc.  unit has been signaling for months that it had interest in adding more controls on the small data files that help website operators, and potentially other entities including advertisers, gain information about visitors. But it has stopped short of actions taken by  Apple Inc.’s  Safari and Mozilla Corp.’s Firefox to roll out broader restrictions on tracking cookies. As Google takes the step, publishers and advertisers argue the changes will make the tech giant’s own ad business even stronger as the company will still be able to use data culled from its own internet-search and other properties to target ads to users. Separately, a group of state attorneys general and the Justice Department are probing whether Google, which hauled in $97.24 billion in revenue through three quarters of 2019, engaged in anticompetitive behavior as it grew to become a dominant presence in the U.S. ad business. Google said Tuesday that it would phase out support for third-party cookies in its browser within the next two years, according to a blog post by Justin Schuh, director of Chrome engineering. Third-party cookies, which can be used by ad-tracking or analytics services, are designed to follow users across the internet to learn their browsing habits. Those insights can be valuable to advertisers but have generated consumer privacy concerns for years. “First-party” cookies, for example, can be directly collected by a website through some form of consent or direct relationship with a user.

Farmers coax far more wheat from each acre than they did 111 years ago, but much of the decline in planted acres has come in recent years, concurrent with Russia’s ascent as the world’s dominant supplier and Midwestern farmers’ turn to more profitable crops, like corn and soybeans. Prices for March-dated soft red winter wheat traded around multiyear highs this week. Futures rose 1% Friday to $5.71 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. That is up about 25% from the start of September, which is around when the winter crops were planted. Spot prices for soft red winter wheat in St. Louis have risen 40% since then. Hard red winter wheat, the higher-protein variety typically grown west of the Mississippi River and used for bread, added 2.1% Friday to settle at $4.94 a bushel, up about a third from the start of September. Kansas City wheat, as it is known, is usually priced higher than soft red winter wheat, or Chicago wheat, which is used as animal feed and in highly processed foods.  "

It was, they said, a year of intense heat waves and wildfires, accelerated melting of ice caps, flooding and rising seas. “The decade that just ended is clearly the warmest decade on record,” said Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York. “Every decade since the 1960s clearly has been warmer than the one before.” During 2019, the average temperature across global land and ocean surfaces was 1.8 degree Fahrenheit (0.98 degree Celsius) above the 20th-century mean, with 95% certainty, according to the NASA calculations. The NOAA scientists calculated the average global temperature as 1.71 degrees F (0.95 degree C) above the average for 1901 to 2000.

Rural or urban, Democrat or Republican, we all love Baby Yoda. In case you spent the last month in a monastic retreat, Baby Yoda is the weird but irresistibly adorable creature who is the heart of the series. (He isn’t actually Yoda but a baby of the same species.) The Mandalorian, a ferocious bounty-hunter in a metal helmet, takes on the job of hunting down Baby Yoda but ends up rescuing and caring for him instead. This means finding snacks and sitters and keeping the baby from playing with the knob on the starship gear shift. Why do the Mandalorian and the whole internet love Baby Yoda so much? The answer may tell us something profound about human evolution. Humans have a particularly long and helpless infancy. Our babies depend on older caregivers for twice as long as chimp babies do. As a result, we need more varied caregiving. Chimp mothers look after their babies by themselves, but as the great anthropologist Sarah Hrdy pointed out in her 2009 book “Mothers and Others,” human mothers have always been assisted by fathers, grandparents and “alloparents”—people who look after other folks’ children. No other animal has so many different kinds of caregivers. Those caregivers are what anthropologists call “facultative,” meaning that they only provide care in certain circumstances and not others. Once they are committed to a baby, however, they may be just as devoted and effective as biological mothers. The key factor seems to be the very act of caregiving itself. We don’t take care of babies because we love them; instead, like the Mandalorian, we love babies once we start taking care of them.  "

The strategy has reaped some short-term gains, though the risks include the potential for a loss of global influence in the longer term. President Trump and his team used tariffs to push China toward buying more U.S. goods and reforming its treatment of American companies; increased sanctions pressure on Iran over its nuclear program; considered restricting the Iraqi government’s access to the money it keeps at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in a confrontation over U.S. troops; and used sanctions to target a Russo-German natural gas pipeline, squeezing Berlin in an effort to challenge Moscow. Sanctions and tariffs aren’t new, of course. But until Mr. Trump, the U.S. in the post-Cold War era tended to deploy these tools cautiously, against clear adversaries and in cooperation with key allies. U.S. economic power, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, was generally used as a carrot to draw others into a trading system inspired by America’s free-market values. The carrot is now a stick, largely because Mr. Trump believes the U.S. was suckered by others in the era of globalization it advanced in the 1990s and 2000s. U.S. economic might, in Mr. Trump’s view, can be used as a tool to fix a global trading system he sees as broken and to pursue other goals.  "

WhatsApp in recent months disbanded a team that had been established to find the best ways to integrate ads into the service, according to people familiar with the matter. The team’s work was then deleted from WhatsApp’s code, the people said. The shift marks a detour in the social-media giant’s quest to monetize WhatsApp, which it bought in a blockbuster $22 billion acquisition in 2014 that has yet to pay financial dividends despite the service being used by more than 1.5 billion people globally. Created in 2009, WhatsApp made money initially from download fees and then a $0.99 annual subscription, but Facebook made the platform free after acquiring it. In 2018 Facebook unveiled plans to generate more revenue from the app that included selling ads. A year ago, WhatsApp’s then-chief executive, Chris Daniels, called ads a “primary monetization mode” for the company. Facebook formally unveiled prototypes last May for ads in its Status feature, which allows ephemeral postings similar to Instagram’s Stories.  "

In China, for example, online retailers pulled Juul off their sites just days after the company had launched there. The San Francisco startup is blamed for a surge in underage vaping in the U.S. and is now under investigation by several federal agencies. Its vaporizers and refill pods are currently for sale in 21 countries, including the U.S. Attempting to improve relationships with regulators at home and abroad, the company’s new CEO, K.C. Crosthwaite, is taking a more methodical approach, a Juul official said. He wants to get clarity on e-cigarette policy before launching in a country rather than afterward, this official said. In anticipation of a U.S. ban on most flavored e-cigarette cartridges, the company last fall halted U.S. sales of its sweet and fruity flavors. The company did the same in Canada on Tuesday, stopping production of its mango, fruit, vanilla and cucumber refill pods.  "

The agency first said people should end the use of vaping products in September, but later narrowed that recommendation, warning that people should stop using vaping products containing THC—the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis—but consider refraining from all vaping. The new  recommendation, posted on Thursday, no longer includes the broad reference to stopping vaping, though the agency still says youth, pregnant women and non-tobacco users shouldn’t vape. “Recommendations were refined to reflect the best available scientific evidence and to best protect public health,” Brian King, the chief science officer for the CDC’s vaping-related outbreak response, said in a statement. Evidence has increasingly linked the sudden explosion of vaping-related illnesses to a substance called vitamin E acetate, an oil sometimes added to dilute THC products. THC oils and cannabis products are becoming legal in an increasing number of states across the country.  "

Already, nearly a fifth of China’s population is age 60 or older. A shrinking working-age population can dent the economy through lower productivity and higher labor costs, while an increasing number of elderly pushes up health-care costs. South Korea and Japan are facing similar problems but on a much smaller scale. “The lesson from other East Asian countries is that once the birth rate declines, it’s hard to get back up,” said Julian Evans-Pritchard, an economist at Capital Economics, an economics research firm. “China’s going to have to get used to a continuous drag on growth from shrinking employment.” Economists say China’s economy is on pace to grow around 6% this year. Capital Economics estimates that by 2030 population changes will shave half a percentage point each year off China’s gross domestic product growth rate. There were 10.5 new births per thousand Chinese people in 2019, the lowest rate since the Communist Party established the People’s Republic of China in 1949, according to official data released Friday. The ratio has slumped for three decades following a small uptick in the 1980s and is much lower than it was in 1961, when China suffered one of history’s worst famines.  "

Mistakes were made. An accident during the night seems to have caused an uncontrolled release of neurotoxins known to make people want to be parents. And now you are. The 2020  Kia  Telluride SUV, with optional seating for eight, is aimed at those who have been especially affected by outbreaks of whelping, weaning and child-rearing. While there are plenty of midsize, three-row family SUVs out there, the eight-seat option is a rarer thing. I count only five: Honda Pilot, Toyota Highlander, Chevy Traverse, the Kia, and its mechanical clone, the Hyundai Palisade. So, in addition to being named North American Utility of the Year this week by a jury of automotive media, the Telluride takes home the Breeders’ Cup. The Telluride/Palisade twins were designed and engineered specifically for North America, surely Hyundai Motor Group’s biggest export market, at least in terms of body-mass index. Size has been privileged. The Telluride’s boxy outside encloses an airy 178.1 cubic feet of interior space, with hip, shoulder and elbow room comparable to sitting alone in a ski gondola. The seats are broad, soft and shallowly bolstered at the hips, making entry and exit easy. Even with the third-row seat-backs up, the Telluride reserves 21 cubic feet of cargo space, which is enough to carry a folded baby stroller, or one of those kneeler-wheelers, in case the gout is flaring up. Even though they are built on opposite sides of the Earth—the Palisade in South Korea, the Telluride in Georgia, U.S.A.—the machines are virtually identical, down to millimeters. Both are propelled by a Singer-smooth, direct-injected 3.8-liter V6, paired with the same ghostly eight-speed transmission; both are built on the same platform/parts matrix (front-wheel or all-wheel drive) with the same strut-based front suspension and multi-link rear. And both use the same AWD hardware and multi-mode traction mapping to go places. In Eco and Smart modes, 100% of torque drives the front wheels; in the default Comfort mode (and Snow mode), 20% is shipped to the rear axle; in Sport mode, up to 35%. If you really find yourself in the slush, there is an additional Lock mode, which splits torque 50/50, front and rear.  "

Federal Reserve officials are considering a new tool to ease stresses in the market for Treasury repurchase agreements, or repos. Through the repo market, banks and hedge funds borrow cash overnight, while pledging safe securities such as government bonds as collateral. In September, an unexpected shortage of available cash to lend sparked a surge in the cost of repo-market borrowing, prompting the Fed to intervene for the first time since the financial crisis. One potential solution is to lend cash directly to smaller banks, securities dealers and hedge funds through the repo market’s clearinghouse, the Fixed Income Clearing Corp., or FICC. Hedge funds currently borrow through a process called sponsored repo, in which they ask a large bank to act as a middleman, pairing their government bonds with money-market funds willing to lend cash. The bank then guarantees that the parties will fulfill their obligations—repaying the cash or returning the securities. Firms trading through the FICC contribute to a fund that would cover a borrower’s default. Critics of the new plan say if the Fed lends cash directly through the clearinghouse, it could end up contributing to a hedge-fund bailout. The Fed’s aim, according to analysts, is to step back from temporary efforts to quell repo-market volatility and increase financial reserves. After September’s volatility, officials succeeded in suppressing year-end swings with temporary measures, such as offering short-term repo loans and buying Treasury bills.  "

The disease it causes is called Covid-19. We are updating our questions and answers regularly to keep up with their findings. Here is what they know so far, and how you can minimize your risk. The virus infects both the upper and lower respiratory tract. That means it is contagious, and can cause pneumonia. People who are infected initially develop a fever, cough and aches, and can progress to shortness of breath and complications from pneumonia, according to case reports. Of nearly 56,000 patients in China, 87.9% had a fever, 67.7% had a dry cough, 38.1% experienced fatigue and 18.6% had shortness of breath. Other, less common symptoms included sore throat, headache, aches, chills, repeated shaking with chills, vomiting, diarrhea and nasal congestion. Some people report losing the senses of taste and smell.  Some people become only mildly ill, or are infected but don’t get sick. Others are mildly ill for a few days, then rapidly develop more severe symptoms of pneumonia. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that people with severe symptoms should seek medical treatment immediately. Those severe symptoms include: • Difficulty in breathing or shortness of breath • Persistent pain or pressure in the chest • Bluish lips or face If you think you have been exposed and develop symptoms, call your doctor. Ask if you can be tested. He or she will likely test you first for other respiratory infections such as the flu. Isolate yourself from others and limit contact with pets as well. Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough and sneeze. Follow the same precautions you would to prevent infection, washing hands regularly. Wear a face mask, if you have one, when around others at home. NL63 (1100s) SARS (2003) 229E (1800s) MERS (2012) OC43 (1800s) SARS-CoV-2 (2020) HKU1 (unknown) Source: Timothy Sheahan, University of North Carolina Most people who are infected might become only mildly ill, data suggest. But “mild” can be anything from a fever, cough and aches to pneumonia. So for most people it is probably not just a few sniffles. And mild or not, you’ll have to be isolated or quarantined. By not getting infected, you would also protect those around you, including older family members or anyone you know with heart disease or diabetes, conditions that increase risk of severe illness. Of 44,672 cases in China, 81% had mild symptoms, 13.8% were severely ill, and 4.7% were critically ill, according to the Chinese CDC. All of those who died were in critical condition. Public-health officials are trying to determine how many people have been infected, including those who didn’t get sick at all. They are concerned and want to contain the virus because its effects aren’t fully known. In addition, new viruses can mutate, possibly becoming more virulent as they work their way through a population. The new coronavirus is spreading in many cities, and as long as it is spreading at this rate, there is a risk of getting it. You may not show symptoms right away. People become ill between two and 14 days after infection, or in an average of about 5 days, according to most estimates. Experts say this is helpful for controlling symptoms, which is the mainstay of treating the new coronavirus. But it isn’t a cure and won’t prevent you from infecting others. There have been reports that use of painkillers from a class known as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, containing ingredients like ibuprofen, might worsen Covid-19 infections. Ibuprofen is known to reduce inflammation in the body that may be needed to fight an infection. But the World Health Organization says it doesn’t recommend against the use of ibuprofen. The public health agency said it isn’t aware of evidence on the topic or negative effects in patients from ibuprofen, beyond the usual side effects. It says it is consulting with physicians who are treating patients. Yes, there are diagnostic tests that you can get through a doctor or hospital, which are the only way to confirm for certain whether a patient has the new coronavirus or another infection. Hundreds of thousands of people have been tested in China and South Korea. In the U.S., testing was limited by problems with a CDC-developed test and narrow testing criteria. Now, more tests are being distributed and the CDC says doctors may decide whether a patient should be tested. Blood tests are being developed and licensed to test people for antibodies to the virus, to determine how many have been infected. Some may not have gotten sick. That test could also show whether people who did get sick are immune from reinfection. If you are told to self-isolate, you will need to stay at home and avoid contact with others for 14 days. Try not to stay in the same room with others at the same time, the U.K.’s National Health Service recommends. Stay in a well-ventilated room with a window that can be opened. Don’t share towels, utensils or dishes with others, and wash them thoroughly after use. Clean bathrooms and surfaces regularly. Wash your hands before and after contact with pets. Don’t go out to public places; ask family members or friends to get groceries, medicines and other supplies for you. Ask delivery people to leave items outside. There aren’t any drugs or vaccines approved specifically for the new virus. But more than three dozen are in development or being studied. The first human testing of            Moderna Inc.’s      experimental vaccine against the virus has begun at the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle. While this first part is starting early, the estimate still is that testing of the vaccine will take a year to 18 months to complete. A few other vaccine makers are developing products targeting the virus. Two clinical trials in China and one in the U.S. are evaluating remdesivir, an antiviral drug from            Gilead Sciences Inc.      that was also tested for Ebola. A malaria drug, hydroxychloroquine, has gained attention as a possible treatment, but there is no scientific evidence that it works, experts say. Schools, workplaces and other public gathering places have been closed in many places, and officials are recommending—and in some cases, requiring—that people remain in their homes and away from exposure to other people while the coronavirus continues to spread. Adults of all ages have been infected, but the risk of severe disease and death is highest for older people and those with other health conditions such as heart disease, chronic lung disease, cancer and diabetes. Most of the 1,023 people whose deaths were included in a study by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention were age 60 or older, and/or had other illnesses. Many patients who have died were admitted to hospitals when their illness was advanced. One large study in China found a mortality rate of 14.8% in people ages 80 and older, and 8% in people ages 70 to 79, compared with a 2.3% mortality rate overall in the population studied. Few children have been reported with the infection, but that could change. Of the children who were infected in China, only a small proportion were severely ill, according to the WHO. While the disease is mild for teens and younger adults, some have had severe illnesses and died. Of 121 U.S. patients admitted to an intensive care unit, 12% were adults between the ages of 20 and 44, according to a study by the U.S. CDC. Covid-19 has spread rapidly, with cases identified in all 50 states and large outbreaks in some areas. Federal, state and local officials are taking unprecedented steps to try to minimize transmission, such as banning large gatherings and imposing restrictions on movement. Everyone in the U.S. is being advised to adhere to these measures for their own safety and to protect others, particularly those at highest risk. The number of confirmed cases is substantially lower than the number of actual infections, public-health officials say, because of a shortage of tests and because many people who get infected might not be sick enough to realize it. Public-health officials hope to “flatten the curve” of infections with the social-distancing measures, slowing the spread of the virus so that fewer people are infected. That’s important to keep more people healthy and prevent hospitals from becoming too overwhelmed to care for all of the sick. 2 1 Proteins on the outer shell of the virus allow it to latch onto cells in the host’s respiratory tract.

Source: Timothy Sheahan, University of North Carolina Alberto Cervantes and Josh Ulick /THE WALL STREET JOURNAL It transmits through “respiratory droplets” when an infected person speaks, coughs or sneezes, according to the WHO. The droplets spread through the air and can land on another person’s mouth or nose, or possibly be inhaled into their lungs, infecting them. The droplets can also settle on nearby surfaces like a desk, counter or doorknob, where they can survive for a period. A person can become infected by touching a contaminated surface, then touching their mouth, nose or eyes. Respiratory droplets are heavy and don’t travel far in the air, so transmission is believed to occur mostly through close contact, meaning within 6 feet of an infected person. Scientists are also investigating whether the new coronavirus might spread through urine or feces. Tests have found it in the digestive tract of some patients. It can last up to 72 hours on plastic and stainless steel, up to 24 hours on cardboard and four hours on copper, according to a study in the New England Journal of Medicine by U.S. government and academic scientists. But it degrades quickly, said Vincent Munster, a virologist with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases who led the research. The study also showed that the virus can survive in small droplets, known as aerosols, for about three hours, though it disintegrates over time. These droplets are small enough to remain suspended in the air for half an hour to an hour, depending on air flow, Dr. Munster said. Wipe down countertops, doorknobs and other commonly touched surfaces frequently. Regular household disinfectant wipes and cleaners kill the virus. Health experts and mask makers say only a properly used reusable N95 respirator mask certified by an independent agency can guard fully against the virus. Surgical masks and even cloth masks can provide some protection, though. The U.S. CDC recommends that people wear cloth masks or face coverings—even a bandanna or scarf will do—in public places like grocery stores where social distancing may be difficult. Cloth masks or coverings don’t fully protect wearers from becoming infected because they aren’t completely sealed on the face, according to experts. But they can help prevent people who are infected from spreading the virus by catching droplets emitted while exhaling, coughing or sneezing. They shouldn’t be used on children under 2 years old or anyone who has trouble breathing, the CDC says. The CDC asks people to use nonmedical masks because supplies of masks are short and should be saved for health-care workers and caregivers. The most important thing you can do is wash your hands frequently, for at least 20 seconds each time. Wash them regularly when you are at the office, when you come home, before you eat and other times that you are touching surfaces. You can also use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Don’t touch your eyes, nose or mouth—viruses can enter your body that way. Wipe down objects and surfaces frequently with household cleaner, which will kill the virus. Maintain a distance from people who are sick. Stay about 6 feet or more away from others. Stock up on some supplies when recommended to stay home, infectious-disease experts say. Items to consider include shelf-stable foods like cans of beans, packages of rice and pasta, and beverages; pain relievers and other common medications; extra prescription medications; and hygiene and cleaning products. The State Department advises U.S. citizens to avoid all travel abroad due to the global impact of Covid-19, and has urged Americans currently abroad to return home immediately. Citizens living abroad are also advised to avoid all international travel. Those who are in countries where outbreaks are occurring should stay home as much as possible, limit contact with others and follow guidelines from the CDC to prevent infection, U.S. authorities say. The CDC, American Red Cross and U.S. Surgeon General are encouraging people to donate blood, if they are able and healthy. “Social distancing does not have to mean social disengagement,” said Surgeon General            Jerome Adams. To minimize risks of exposure to the new coronavirus, the CDC has recommended that blood centers keep donor chairs 6 feet apart and encouraged people to make appointments ahead of time to minimize crowding. This virus belongs to a family of viruses known as coronaviruses. Named for the crown-like spikes on their surfaces, they infect mostly bats, pigs and small mammals. But they mutate easily and can jump from animals to humans, and from one human to another. In recent years, they have become a growing player in infectious-disease outbreaks world-wide. Seven strains are known to infect humans, including this new virus, causing illnesses in the respiratory tract. Four of those strains cause common colds. Two others, by contrast, rank among the deadliest of human infections: severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, and Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS. This new virus is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2. The disease it causes is called Covid-19. (The number stands for 2019, the year it emerged.) The overall global mortality rate has ranged between 2% and over 4%, according to calculations of confirmed cases and deaths world-wide, which change daily. But the true rate won’t be known until epidemiologists can determine the denominator, meaning how many people have actually been infected. That number will include people who never had symptoms, or had a flulike illness but never got a test for Covid-19. The mortality rate has differed by region, according to a report by an international mission of experts to China led by WHO. The mortality rate was 5.8% in the first several weeks in Wuhan, China, where the epidemic originated. But in other, less hard-hit areas of China, which had more time to prepare to care for patients, it was 0.7%. The rate in China has come down over time, the report said. The overall mortality rate may be less than 1%, U.S. health officials suggested recently in the New England Journal of Medicine, if the number of asymptomatic or mildly ill cases is several times greater than that of reported cases. That is still much deadlier than seasonal flu, which has a mortality rate of about 0.1%. Covid-19 appears to be less deadly than the related pathogen—SARS, which erupted in China in 2002 and spread globally in 2003. SARS killed about 10% of the people it infected. Covid-19 is far less deadly than MERS or Ebola. But this new virus spreads from one person to another more easily than SARS, some disease modeling and case studies suggest.

Sources: BMC Infectious Diseases; The Journal of Hospital Infection Research: Lindsay Huth and Taylor Umlauf   Graphic: Alberto Cervantes/THE WALL STREET JOURNAL Disease-modeling experts have estimated that on average, each infected person has transmitted the virus to about 2.6 others, though the range is between 1.5 and 3.5 and one recent report put that number as high as 5.7 for the epidemic in China. Those rates are higher than for some influenza viruses; some are lower than for SARS; and they are far lower than for measles, in which one infected person can transmit the virus to 12 to 18 other people. Public-health experts caution that these estimates are preliminary, change over time and can be lowered by measures to prevent the virus from spreading. Experts are debating how easily the virus is transmitted. The WHO-led mission of experts who visited China reported that clusters of transmission occurred largely in families, suggesting close contact. Other outbreaks suggest more widespread patterns. MOST COMMON EARLY SYMPTOMS Fever 98% Cough 76 Aches, fatigue 44 HOW THE DISEASE PROGRESSED Avg. days since onset of symptoms 7 8 9 10.5 days Admitted to hospital Acute respiratory distress No. of patients 41 21 11 16 Admitted to intensive care unit Shortness of breath OUTCOMES* Out of 41 patients 28 Discharged from hospital 7 Still hospitalized 6 Died *As of Jan. 22, roughly 20 days after coronavirus diagnoses confimed    Source: The Lancet People become ill between two and 14 days after infection, according to most estimates. One report described a person who became ill 27 days after infection. However, a study by researchers at Johns Hopkins University found that the median incubation period is 5.1 days, and 97.5% of those who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days. That isn’t yet known. Sometimes a person is immune to a disease after an infection, but not always. Blood tests that reveal how many antibodies people who have recovered have will shed some light on the prospects for immunity. Several studies have now shown that people who have no symptoms, early symptoms or mild symptoms can transmit the virus to others. Scientists say this type of transmission might be common, and a possible explanation for why the virus spreads so quickly. They are studying it further. The CDC advises people to maintain a safe distance—6 feet or more—from others if Covid-19 is spreading in their communities. The new virus likely came originally from bats, scientists say. It isn’t known exactly where or how it jumped to humans, though. Viruses from bats often infect another mammal first and then mutate to become more transmissible to humans. One hypothesis is that the intermediary animal for this new virus may be a pangolin, a small mammal sold in wildlife markets, prized for its meat and scales covering its body. Do you have questions about the risk of the new coronavirus from China? Join the conversation below. Health officials believe the outbreak originated in a large animal and seafood market in Wuhan, China. Of the first 41 cases, 27 had some exposure to that market, according to a report in the Lancet. But three of the first four people to become ill, on Dec. 1 and Dec. 10, said they had no contact with the market. A study in the New England Journal of Medicine found that 55% of patients in Wuhan who became ill before Jan. 1 had a link to the market, compared with 8.6% of those who became ill after that point. Scientists say it will take some time to identify the exact source. While the virus has made some genetic changes—as RNA viruses are prone to do—none have made it deadlier or more contagious, according to experts. That is unlikely, the CDC says. Coronaviruses generally don’t survive that long on inanimate surfaces, according to the agency.

Researchers at the University of Queensland in Australia are also trying to develop a vaccine against the strain. Some of the experimental vaccines targeting the Wuhan virus could be ready for human testing in a few months, though approval for widespread use will take longer. The research was triggered by the rapid spread of the virus, which has infected hundreds in China, killing more than a dozen people. Since first appearing in a meat-and-fish market last month, the virus has spread to other countries in Asia and a man in Washington state has been diagnosed, the first confirmed U.S. case. There are no known vaccines or treatments approved specifically for the virus, dubbed nCoV-2019, which belongs to a family of coronaviruses responsible for outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome, known as SARS, and Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS, in recent years.

The Justice Department made that determination in a December letter to the secret court that oversees surveillance of suspected foreign spies, acknowledging it may have lacked probable cause to continue wiretapping in the last two of the four surveillance applications it sought against Mr. Page. The government began the surveillance in late 2016, after he left the Trump campaign, and continued monitoring him until late 2017—ultimately obtaining a warrant and three subsequent renewals. The last two applications were submitted in April and June of 2017. It now has concluded there was “insufficient predication to establish probable cause” in the last two renewals, which authorized about six months of surveillance on the former adviser. Probable cause is the legal standard to obtain a secret warrant against suspected agents of a foreign power from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, the secret judicial panel that approves such warrants. The Justice Department letter is classified, but is referenced in a new order declassified by the judge that heads the FISA court, James Boasberg, on Thursday. The Justice Department said it would sequester all the material it collected against Mr. Page pending further internal review of the matter.  "

The number of union members fell by 170,000 in 2019—a year when U.S. employers added more than 2.1 million jobs—reducing the share of the workforce in labor unions to 10.3%, the lowest portion on record since 1983, the Labor Department said Wednesday. Overall union membership rates have trended at record lows for a decade. “The big picture presents the now familiar story of a gradual decline in unions across most industries,” said Marick Masters, a business professor at Wayne State University in Detroit who studies labor unions. In 2019, there were 14.6 million union members and 141.7 million total U.S. workers. The fall in union membership reflects both the declining power of organized labor in the U.S. and slower employment growth in traditionally more unionized industries, such as manufacturing, transportation and utilities, compared with health care and other services.

They have a point. But the precedents that Democrats are setting could live on, so forgive us if we explain how dangerous the House’s impeachment logic is to future Presidents and the Constitution’s separation of powers. Especially pernicious is the new House “corrupt purposes” standard for removing a President from office. The House managers don’t assert that any specific action by President Trump was an abuse of power or a violation of law. They don’t deny he can delay aid to a foreign country or ask a foreign leader to investigate corruption. Presidents do that all the time. Instead they assert in their first impeachment article that Mr. Trump is guilty of “abuse of power” because he committed those acts for “corrupt purposes.” As an aside here, we should repeat that a President doesn’t have to break a specific law to commit an impeachable offense. Mr. Trump’s lawyers are wrong on this point. Presidents were accused of breaking specific laws in America’s three previous impeachments. But under the Constitution a President can commit “high crimes and misdemeanors” if he commits non-criminal acts that exceed his executive authority or if he refuses to execute the law. But this means committing specific acts that are impeachable in and of themselves. Examples might be deploying U.S. troops against political opponents, or suspending habeas corpus without Congressional assent. (Lincoln received a Congressional pass in wartime.) House Democrats are going much further and declaring that Mr. Trump’s acts are impeachable because he did them for “personal political benefit.” He isn’t accused of corruption per se. His Ukraine interventions are said to be corrupt because he intended them to help him win re-election this year. In other words, his actions were impeachable only because his motives were self-serving.  "

Mr. Xi has been in a hurry to elevate China’s place on the global stage since he took the helm of the Communist Party more than seven years ago. Yet many of his efforts to lift China’s economic, political and military influence have failed to win hearts and minds abroad, even among leaders who oppose Mr. Trump’s “America First” policies and support globalization. Mr. Xi enjoys key strengths as a globalist. China appears to be leapfrogging the world in certain next-generation technology like 5G telecommunications, bolstering its engineering talent with state money. Its 400 million middle-income earners are a new global business opportunity, whether as tourists or customers, so Mr. Xi will likely remain welcome anywhere so long as China sustains growth.  "

But the challenge of forecasting temperatures far out has made such assessments tough. In recent months, estimates among climate scientists of how temperatures are likely to rise over the course of the century have narrowed somewhat. The most catastrophic predicted warming looks less likely, but milder impacts also are looking less probable. The current broad consensus is that the world could warm by roughly three degrees Celsius by 2100. While such predictions are still imprecise, and the course of climate change dependent on technological change and policy response, a narrower range of possibilities could help business leaders make better decisions, such as where to source key agricultural ingredients and locate long-term investments, say people who work with corporations on climate goals. “There is more of a sense of certainty, and more industries that are analytical-based—finance and insurance come to mind—can lean in much more substantively than they have in the past,” says Hugh Welsh, president of the North American unit of Royal DSM NV, a global manufacturer of nutritional products and specialized materials. For insurers, that could mean better pinpointing where and when to raise rates; for finance firms, knowing with more certainty which projects to fund or reject. Late last year, the International Energy Agency, a Paris-based group made up of large energy-consuming nations, reported it expected that if nations stay on their current policy paths in terms of emissions, it would result in warming close to the middle of some previously forecast ranges.

The World Health Organization said that Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus plans to convene an emergency committee Wednesday to determine whether to declare the outbreak a public-health emergency of international concern. The designation helps the WHO mobilize resources to prevent and combat the spread to other countries. The WHO said Monday the spread of the disease was likely the product of “some limited human-to-human transmission occurring between close contacts.” The outbreak is believed to have started in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where a number of infected patients were exposed to a large seafood and livestock wholesale market. Coronaviruses most commonly infect mammals, including pigs and cats, but can jump from animals to humans.  "

The World Health Organization on Thursday declined to declare the outbreak a global public health emergency, citing a limited number of cases abroad and efforts under way to bring it under control. On Thursday, authorities in Huanggang—a Chinese city of 7.5 million people—said they wouldn’t let long-distance trains and buses run from the urban center and would shut its public transportation system in the lockdown zone, effective midnight Friday local time. Ezhou, another neighboring city with just over a million residents, said it would enact similar restrictions, bringing the total number of cities with travel restrictions to three. Huanggang is about 35 miles east of Wuhan, a city of 11 million and a major hub for travel, where the new pneumonia-causing coronavirus originated. Wuhan just hours earlier halted outbound trains and flights and shut down its public-transportation system. The Huanggang local government also said movie theaters, internet cafes and other entertainment and cultural facilities in the city center would temporarily halt operations and a central market would be shut down for an indefinite period. Starting Thursday, the local government said it would inspect every person and car entering and exiting the urban center.  "

For years, many home cooks—myself included—would have said no. A kitchen is a place we go in search of warmth and coziness. I used to find the idea of treating this homely space as some kind of high-tech laboratory slightly off-putting. But there are signs that more home cooks are embracing science in the kitchen. The other day, while browsing for food books, I noticed that “The Food Lab: Better Home Cooking Through Science,” by J. Kenji López-Alt, had overtaken the 2019 edition of “The Joy of Cooking” in the number of customer reviews it had received on Amazon, with an average rating of five stars. Ratings aren’t everything, but this is surely a sign that thousands of home cooks now see scientific cooking as a positive thing, giving us the tools to produce everyday dishes in a more delicious or reliable way. If science can help us make a meat loaf that won’t fall apart (gelatin is the secret ingredient) or produce lighter waffles (by adding club soda), then what’s not to like? The new kitchen science is partly driven by the vogue for weekend cooking projects such as sourdough-making and fermentation, which naturally lend themselves to a scientific approach. Sourdough bakers often start tinkering obsessively with hydration levels in the dough, and from there it’s a short step to thinking about all cooking in a more precise way. Take a quick look inside any kitchenware store and you can see it’s become completely normal to weigh ingredients on digital scales, or to check the doneness of a roast chicken using an instant-read thermometer. Like many people, I grew up convinced that science was the enemy of good cooking. For my mother, it meant cheap, industrial food—the opposite of the traditional things she did in her own kitchen, where she took fresh vegetables and meat and herbs and turned them into a beef stew. She believed that microwave ovens were only slightly less terrifying than nuclear bombs. If she disliked a dish she ordered in a restaurant, she would often say it had a “chemical” taste.  "

A new rule proposed by the U.S. Department of Transportation would permit airlines to stop accepting emotional-support animals on planes, allowing only service dogs that are professionally trained to perform tasks or assist passengers with disabilities, including psychiatric disorders. Airlines have argued for years that the current rules typically requiring airlines to treat support animals as service animals—both of which fly free of charge—are too loose, leading many passengers to claim ordinary pets as support animals to avoid fees of $125 or more for international flights. Carriers say that has forced them to accommodate a surge of untrained animals that have bitten passengers, scuffled with other pets or left messes for crew members to clean up. Airlines reported receiving over 3,000 complaints about service animals in 2018, up from 719 five years earlier, according to the DOT. The agency’s proposed rule, which would be open for public comment for 60 days, would also allow airlines to impose additional restrictions on service animals. Such limits could include requiring passengers traveling with a service animal to arrive at the airport an hour earlier than others to verify their animal’s credentials, capping the number of service animals a single passenger can travel with and requiring a service animal be leashed and harnessed.

Starting Tuesday morning, drivers who ferry passengers from airports in Santa Barbara, Palm Springs and Sacramento can charge up to five times the fare Uber sets on a ride, according to a person involved in developing the feature. Uber confirmed in an emailed statement that it is doing an “initial test” that “would give drivers more control over the rates they charge riders.” The ride-hailing giant has made many changes to the way it works in response to California’s passage of Assembly Bill 5. The law requires companies to treat workers as employees—eligible for sick days and other benefits—rather than independent contractors if they are controlled by their employer and contribute to its usual course of business. Uber has argued that it is a technology platform that connects riders with drivers, not a transportation company, so the drivers aren’t part of its usual course of business. At least two lawsuits have been filed in federal court alleging that Uber misclassified drivers, citing the law, which took effect Jan. 1. Separately, the lawmaker who wrote AB5 has urged attorneys in some of California’s biggest cities to enforce the statute. The fare test and other recent changes are part of Uber’s effort to strengthen its case that its drivers operate with some degree of independence. Earlier this month, Uber capped its commissions on rides across California. Last month, it allowed drivers in the state to see where riders were going, letting them choose the trips they wanted to take. Previously, drivers agreed to trips without knowing the destination.  "

They say the audit left several major technical questions about the incident unexplained and in need of more examination. “It is not a conclusive report,” said Bill Marczak, a researcher with Citizen Lab, a Toronto-based technology watchdog that has tracked Saudi Arabia’s use of surveillance tools. “It raises some interesting questions, some of which I think require further explanation.” The report was produced by business-advisory firm  FTI Consulting  following an investigation commissioned by Mr. Bezos. Gavin de Becker, a security consultant hired separately by Mr. Bezos, publicly alleged last March that the investigators had determined “with high confidence” that the Saudis had accessed private information on Mr. Bezos’ phone. The FTI report has already caused ripples, with two United Nations officials on Wednesday publicizing its analysis and calling on the U.S. to conduct further investigations, including into Saudi Arabia’s alleged use of commercial spyware to target political opponents with intrusive digital surveillance.

If public-health authorities don’t interrupt the spread soon, the virus could infect many thousands more around the globe, disrupt air travel, overwhelm health-care systems, and, worst of all, claim more lives. The good news: There’s still an opening to prevent a grim outcome. China failed to contain the virus early. More cases in the U.S. are inevitable. Experience with the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic suggests that emergency measures such as school closures and border screening—in place at 20 U.S. airports—can at most buy time. Several traits of the virus make border surveillance less effective. It results in a respiratory illness that looks like many other diseases. Some infected people won’t show symptoms while they’re traveling. Checkpoints don’t have tests that can diagnose the virus rapidly. The U.S. government’s actions to prevent the virus from entering the country are valuable, and there aren’t many good options in such early stages of crisis response. But it’s time for additional measures. As more U.S. cases develop, the strategy needs to incorporate another goal: preventing transmission of the coronavirus within the U.S. Four important steps now could  help. First, the most important public-health tool for containment is the identification and isolation of cases to break the chain of spread. Public-health authorities and health-care systems are on high alert for potential cases. But authorities can’t act quickly without a test that can diagnose the condition rapidly. Health-care providers are relying on a polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, test conducted only at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This test can be very accurate. But the procedure currently requires sending patient samples out to the CDC. It takes at least a couple of days to receive test results. Meanwhile, patients must be kept in isolation.  "

One way to tell is that even moderate Democratic 2020 presidential candidates have quietly proposed to raise the tax rate on labor by double digits and it’s received almost no attention. Unlike single-payer health care and wealth taxes, this tax increase could command majority support in a Democratic Congress on day one. The idea is to increase the Social Security payroll tax, the 12.4% levy that falls directly on labor and is not eligible for deductions. Currently the tax applies to income up to $137,700, split between employer and employee. Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar want to impose it on all labor income above $250,000. Joe Biden wants it to fall on income above $400,000. Pete Buttigieg says he wants “additional Social Security taxes” on income above $250,000. Meanwhile, Representative John Larson’s Social Security 2100 Act, cosponsored by 208 House Democrats, would apply the tax to income above $400,000 to finance an expansion of the entitlement. The bill would also gradually raise the payroll tax rate on all workers to 14.8% from 12.4%. As entitlement watcher Charles Blahous notes, that’s a 19% increase in the payroll tax burden. That’s significant for less-skilled workers who don’t earn enough or have too many dependents to pay income tax. Raising rates on high earners may be less politically toxic but it’s terrible economics. Experts can debate how much the top rate affects the incentive to work for, say, a dentist or an engineer, and whether a two, three or five percentage-point tax-rate increase has an effect on the wider economy. But there’s little doubt a new 12.4% tax would depress incentives and reduce America’s competitive advantage for high-skilled workers and make the tax structure more typical of European countries.

A federal criminal complaint alleges that Charles Lieber, a pioneer in nanotechnology, misled the Defense Department and the National Institutes of Health about his participation in China’s Thousand Talents Plan while the U.S. agencies were spending more than $15 million to fund his research group in the U.S. Through its government-backed Thousand Talents Plan and hundreds of similar programs, China pays scientists around the world to moonlight at Chinese institutions, often without disclosing the work to their primary employers. The case was one of three presented Tuesday by federal authorities in Massachusetts, with each underscoring U.S. concerns that the Chinese government is trying to obtain cutting-edge U.S. research by exploiting U.S. universities and their professors and researchers. Prosecutors have brought a series of cases charging Chinese Americans and Chinese nationals working in the U.S., prompting concern in the scientific community that authorities were racially profiling people. Mr. Lieber is among the first non-Chinese scientists and highest-profile targets to date. As part of the Thousand Talents program, Wuhan University of Technology gave Mr. Lieber more than $1.5 million to set up a research lab in China, according to the complaint.  "

The move could further heighten the global response to the outbreak. The agency made the declaration after a meeting of its emergency committee, which declined to do so last week. Since then, China, other governments and multinational businesses have taken emergency steps to limit the virus’s spread, including halting some travel to China. Noting the WHO’s declaration, the State Department told Americans not to go to China, raising its travel alert to the highest level Thursday. It advised that people in China should consider leaving the country and said it requested that all nonessential U.S. government personnel postpone travel there. The State Department advises the same “do not travel” warning for countries including Afghanistan and Syria. In the U.S., a sixth person tested positive for the infection in the first case of human-to-human transmission. The patient is the husband of a Chicago woman infected with the virus whose case was reported last week. She had recently traveled to Wuhan, the central Chinese city where the coronavirus first emerged last month. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state officials emphasized that the overall risk for people in the U.S. and in Illinois remains low. “This person-to-person spread was between two very close contacts, a wife and husband,” said Ngozi Ezike, the director of the Illinois Department of Public Health. “It is not spreading in the wider community.” Public-health authorities said the WHO designation helps mobilize resources to contain the virus’s spread. The WHO’s director-general can make recommendations to the international community, though they aren’t legally binding. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he was confident in China’s capacity to control the outbreak, which has sickened more than 9,500 people and killed 213—up from 170 a day earlier—mostly in China’s Hubei province, which surrounds Wuhan. “Let me be clear. This declaration is not a vote of no confidence in China,” Dr. Tedros said.  “I have never in my life seen this kind of mobilization.” The number of infection cases in China surpassed the global total for severe acute respiratory syndrome, though SARS killed nearly 800 people after emerging in southern China in late 2002 and into 2003. Since it gained the power, in 2005, to declare an international emergency, WHO had applied the designation to just five prior situations. The first was in 2009 in response to the H1N1 swine flu, followed by polio in 2014 and the Ebola and Zika virus outbreaks in 2016. It declared a public emergency for another Ebola outbreak in 2019 and faced criticism for delaying that decision. At least 18 other countries or territories have also reported a small number of coronavirus cases, with Finland, India and the Philippines now reporting cases in people who have traveled to Wuhan, according to WHO. In response to the virus, Russia has tightened its border with China and the U.S. announced plans for a second evacuation of Americans from Wuhan. Companies including            Tesla Inc.      and IKEA temporarily halted operations in China. The CDC has investigated 165 people in the U.S. for the virus, according to the numbers released Wednesday, and 68 have tested negative and been cleared. Over 90 cases are pending, and health authorities said that they expect additional cases. The new Chicago patient lived with and was in consistent close contact with his wife. After returning to the U.S. on Jan. 13, she developed symptoms and was hospitalized in an isolated setting. Once her husband also started developing symptoms he was quickly taken to the hospital. The patient, who has underlying health issues, is in a stable condition, health authorities said. “It is clear that this virus is highly transmittable, and this assumption is based on the rapid rate of spread of this infection in China,” said            Eyal Leshem,      director of the Institute for Travel and Tropical medicine at Sheba Medical Center in Israel. “When there is a public-health uncertainty, you always want to slightly overreact to make sure that you don’t miss a critical issue,” Dr. Leshem said. “Once you learn a little bit more about the risk and the effective steps, then you can scale back.” Health authorities believe the virus spread while the first patient in Chicago was symptomatic, rather than before. Officials said the man, who is in his 60s, didn’t attend any mass gatherings. There are 21 people under investigation in Illinois for possible infection, Dr. Ezike said, and local and federal health authorities are working to monitor close contacts of the second Chicago patient. Nancy Messonnier,      director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the CDC, called the coronavirus “a very serious public-health situation.” She added: “We’re trying to spark a balance in our response right now.” The CDC said that people who had recently traveled should be vigilant for symptoms and signs of the virus, which include fever, cough and shortness of breath. President Trump during a speech in Michigan said the administration is working closely with China and sought to minimize fears about the virus in the U.S. “We think we have it very well under control. We have very little problem in this country at this moment,” Mr. Trump said, adding that the handful of victims are recuperating. “We think it’s going to have a very good ending for us. That I can assure you.” On Wednesday, Mr. Trump announced a task force to address the coronavirus, which he said had been meeting daily since Monday. The group is led by Health and Human Services Secretary            Alex Azar. Members of a House of Representatives panel briefed by federal medical officials Thursday said that traditional means of stopping infection are still the best guard against the virus’s spread. Members of the subcommittee said federal officials appear to have the situation in hand and that there isn’t any need for a coronavirus “czar,” as was appointed during the Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa during the Obama administration. Authorities in Russia, meanwhile, said they would temporarily restrict passage through 16 road, rail and river checkpoints along its 2,670-mile border with China. Though Russia’s national carrier            Aeroflot      hasn’t stopped flying to China smaller Russian airlines have canceled flights. A number of countries have pushed ahead with efforts to extract their citizens from central China. The State Department on Thursday said it is planning a second evacuation flight from Wuhan for the hundreds of American citizens still believed to be in the city. The Indian government is seeking permission from Chinese authorities to operate two flights to repatriate citizens from Hubei province, and will quarantine them for 14 days.  In Japan, controversy erupted Wednesday after two people on a government-chartered evacuation flight from Wuhan to Tokyo refused to be tested for the new virus. Prime Minister            Shinzo Abe      told Parliament on Thursday that while the government had pushed for all 206 passengers on the flight to be tested, it had no legal power to compel them. Three people on the flight tested positive for the virus, including two without symptoms, according to the health ministry. The two who refused testing didn’t show symptoms, health ministry official            Takuma Kato      said. A second charter flight to evacuate Japanese citizens from Wuhan arrived in Tokyo on Thursday, and Mr. Kato said all 210 people aboard agreed to be screened. Meanwhile, immigration officials in Hong Kong scoured the city for visitors from Hubei, finding 15 on Wednesday night during searches of 110 hotels, according to Lam Shuk-Yee, deputy secretary for security of the Chinese territory on Thursday. Ms. Lam said 1,600 people from the province had been turned away at the Hong Kong border since the ban. On the corporate front, big multinational companies moved to temporarily shut down China operations as workers remained largely in place, with the Lunar New Year holiday extended through the end of the week and transportation links largely curtailed. Tesla Chief Financial Officer            Zach Kirkhorn      said Wednesday that the company was halting production at its new Shanghai Gigafactory to comply with a local-government order to extend the Lunar New Year holiday, which Mr. Kirkhorn said could affect the company’s first-quarter performance. All 30 IKEA outlets in mainland China were closed until further notice, the Swedish furniture giant said Thursday. Get an early-morning briefing about the coronavirus each weekday and a weekly Health newsletter when the crisis abates. Air France      joined the list of airlines cutting service to China. The carrier said it would suspend all scheduled flights to and from the mainland until Feb. 9 and operate special flights starting Friday using volunteer crew to enable customers and employees to depart safely. Italian authorities held 6,000 passengers and crew aboard a cruise ship at the port of Civitavecchia near Rome after a 54-year-old Chinese woman showed flulike symptoms. Health authorities late Thursday ruled out she was affected by coronavirus and passengers were allowed to disembark, according to a statement by Costa Crociere, the company operating the ship. China’s national women’s soccer team is being held in quarantine in a hotel in the Australian city of Brisbane until Feb. 5, health authorities for the northwestern state of Queensland said Thursday. The 32-member team had traveled to Australia to compete in a qualifying tournament for this summer’s Olympics in Tokyo. The tournament was originally scheduled to be held in Wuhan but was moved to Sydney after the outbreak. The team had departed Wuhan Jan. 22, before the city was locked down, said the Chinese Football Association, which said it also planned to suspend soccer competitions nationwide starting Thursday. In Chongqing, a southwestern China city of more than 30 million people that borders Hubei, pharmacies are now required to report the names of people who buy medication for symptoms such as fever and cough, part of an effort to track people who might have coronavirus symptoms, state broadcaster China Central Television reported Thursday. The city had 165 confirmed cases of the virus as of midnight Wednesday.

Or Fox News host Tucker Carlson, Nobel Prize-winning Clinton administration economist Joseph Stiglitz and billionaire investor Ray Dalio? Among many other prominent elected officials, commentators, public intellectuals and business leaders, they have all voiced concern about the death of the American Dream. And they’re hardly alone. Concern about the decline of the American Dream is widespread and has been heavily influenced by the rise of populism. Frustration with “elites” has saturated the public debate. The game is rigged, we often hear, for everyone except those at the top. Wages and incomes have been stagnant for decades, we are told. The middle class has been permanently weakened. America is no longer an upwardly mobile society. Capitalism is broken. But there’s a problem with this narrative: The American Dream is alive and well. Freshman U.S. Sen. Joshua Hawley, Republican from Missouri and a rising star of conservative populism, gave a commencement address this past spring and declared that the majority of Americans “haven’t seen a real wage increase in 30 years.” The senator’s argument that wages and incomes have been stagnant for decades is common and is frequently cited as evidence that the American Dream is dead. But it is more wrong than right. Consider the wages of “typical” workers—those who are not managers or supervisors. Roughly four in five workers in the U.S. economy fall into this group.  "

Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar declared a public health emergency Friday. He said foreign citizens who have traveled anywhere in China within the past 14 days would be denied U.S. entry, while Americans who visited Hubei province would be quarantined for up to two weeks. At the same time, Mr. Azar sought to minimize fears about the virus spreading further in the U.S. “I hope that people will see that their government is taking responsible steps to protect them,” he said at a White House briefing. “The risk is low…but our job is to keep that risk low.” There are seven confirmed cases in the U.S., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said, while 191 other people are being checked for possible infection, HHS officials said. The number of people infected in China approached 12,000 as the death toll from the pneumonia-causing virus rose to 259 as of late Friday, according to China’s National Health Commission. The quarantine of 195 Americans who were evacuated earlier this week from Hubei province—the first in the U.S. ordered by the federal government in roughly 50 years—came as the U.K. and Russia each reported their first cases of the virus, while other countries moved to limit air traffic with China.

The government said Huawei would be given permission to build noncritical parts of the country’s 5G network. Britain’s National Security Council concluded that the security risks the Chinese company presented could be managed. Huawei officials have repeatedly denied claims that its equipment could be used by the Chinese state to spy on countries or incapacitate key infrastructure. “Nothing in this review affects this country’s ability to share highly sensitive intelligence data over highly secure networks, both within the U.K., and with our partners,” British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said. The decision is a major setback for American-led efforts to clamp down on the use of Huawei products, and could embolden other countries to follow the U.K.’s lead. Germany is expected to make a decision on whether to allow Huawei to build sections of its own 5G network this year. Canada is also still to decide whether to block the equipment maker. U.S. officials visited London recently to reiterate their fears that the use of Huawei would strengthen China’s attempt to gain a stranglehold on the global telecom-equipment market. In recent days, President Trump, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have warned U.K. officials of what they describe as the dangers of allowing telecom companies to use Huawei equipment.

The crashes have drawn intense scrutiny of the plane maker’s engineering culture, damaged the company’s relationships with suppliers and customers, and led to the ouster of its chief executive last month.

The government will spend $1 trillion more than it collects in 2020 and deficits will reach or exceed that threshold every year for the foreseeable future. As a share of gross domestic product, the deficit will be at least 4.3% every year through 2030. That would be the longest stretch of budget deficits exceeding 4% of GDP over the past century, according to the CBO, an nonpartisan arm of Congress. Debt held by the public is projected to be 81% of GDP this year and to reach 98% by 2030. That stems from the combination of tax cuts and projected increases in spending—particularly on safety-net programs such as Medicare and Social Security as the population ages and health-care costs rise. Budget deficits were larger after the 2008-09 financial crisis, but what makes the current period unusual is that the gap between taxes and spending has remained high even as the economy extends a record-long expansion. Persistently low interest rates have provided a fiscal cushion for the U.S. and kept deficits from growing even faster.  "

The Huanan food market, a scruffy complex of 1,000 stalls spread over an area the size of nine football fields, is the largest of its kind in central China, mostly supplying seafood to Wuhan’s residents and restaurants. It is typical of the wet markets where most people in this country buy their food. Like many such markets, it also sold wild animals enjoyed as culinary delicacies or used as traditional medicine—an ancient trade Beijing has continued to allow despite warnings that it caused a deadly coronavirus outbreak almost two decades ago and could trigger another global epidemic. On Sunday, authorities imposed a temporary nationwide ban on the trade of wild animals and quarantined all wildlife breeding centers. The central government also said it is taking over the effort to stem the outbreak from officials in Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital, after those officials’ sluggish reaction drew criticism. State media reported that Premier Li Keqiang has been put in charge of the Communist Party’s new “leading small group” of senior officials that is directing response to the virus nationwide.  "

The bloc’s economic weakness also reflects longer-term problems, including an aging and stagnant population, a weak presence in faster-growing digital sectors and problems coordinating its responses to those and other challenges across its 19 member countries. Economists don’t expect a pickup in economic growth in 2020, although the manufacturing sector is expected to steady as global trade flows level out, aided in part by the recent trade truce between the U.S. and China. But they also say the economy could slow further if trade tensions with the U.S. escalate and the U.K.’s departure from the European Union on Friday leaves the future of commerce with one of the eurozone’s main export markets uncertain. The European Union’s statistics agency said Friday the eurozone’s gross domestic product—the value of all goods and services produced across the economy—grew 1.2% last year, its weakest expansion since 2013, when the currency area was emerging from its twin government debt and banking crises. That slowdown was in keeping with a wider global pattern, with the U.S. and China also having recorded decelerations in 2019. However, the eurozone economy was significantly more sluggish than its U.S. counterpart, which expanded by 2.3%. Overall, the global economy had its weakest year since the global financial crisis, although the International Monetary Fund expects to see a modest pickup in 2020.  "

But his trade and tariff forays undermined business investment and global manufacturing, and the economy is now back down to a 2% growth plateau. That’s nowhere near a recession, but it’s disappointing as a lost opportunity. That’s the important news in Thursday’s report that the U.S. economy grew in 2019’s fourth quarter at a 2.1% annual rate—the third quarter in a row of 2% or 2.1%. A healthy first quarter pushed growth for the year to 2.3%, but that’s down from 2.9% in 2018 and a five-quarter spurt from mid-2017 through mid-2018 when capital investment surged and the economy grew faster than 3%. What happened? Mr. Trump blames the Federal Reserve, and we warned at the end of 2018 about the uncertainty of raising rates and winding down its bond purchases at the same time. But the Fed quickly corrected that mistake, and its policy hasn’t been tight in the last few months. The big policy shift was trade. Tax reform passed in December 2017, and Mr. Trump kicked off his trade offensive in the first quarter of 2018 with solar and washing machine tariffs, then steel and aluminum tariffs, saber rattling over Nafta withdrawal and car tariffs, and then the tariff showdown with China. The cost in lost growth is all over the 2019 data. The surge in business investment that followed tax reform gradually ebbed as uncertainty over trade policy spread. Businesses have pulled back investment since they can’t be sure of supply chains or input costs. Global manufacturing took a hit as China’s growth slowed, which hurt Europe.  "

The virus’s spread has disrupted some car manufacturing in China and prompted major auto companies with operations there to restrict travel and ask employees to stay home. One German auto supplier said Tuesday that at least five employees had been infected. The Chinese auto industry has grown from virtually nothing 30 years ago to become the world’s largest market for new vehicles, surpassing the U.S. in 2009. Wuhan, Hubei’s capital and the believed source of the outbreak, has in that period emerged as an auto-making hub, home to state-owned Chinese car manufacturer Dongfeng Motor Corp. and numerous assembly plants building cars for  Honda Motor Co. ,  PSA Group  and  General Motors  Co. Analysts say it is still far too soon to estimate the potential damage to the auto industry from the outbreak, but pointed out that the short-term impact of the SARS outbreak in China in 2003 is a poor comparison, because China’s car market at the time was much smaller. While China’s car sales have boomed for much of the past decade, consumer demand there has begun to taper off. Industrywide sales fell for a second year in a row last year, and analysts warn that should the outbreak become more severe it could further hurt the auto sector.  "

But more U.S. citizens aren’t leaving, having failed to secure a seat on the single U.S.-bound flight—or decided to ride out the emergency where they are. A State Department evacuation flight promised relief for a segment of Wuhan’s roughly 1,000 Americans, as a lockdown triggered by a coronavirus outbreak turned the focus to the dangers of contagion and a long quarantine in China’s eighth-most-populous city. Roads, restaurants and many shops in Wuhan, a city of 11 million, are now shut as China tries to contain the virus. A U.S. charter jet was expected to arrive at Wuhan’s closed airport on Tuesday and quickly depart for the U.S., ferrying 230 or so U.S. diplomats, their family members and an “extremely limited” number of private citizens back to the U.S., according to a State Department notice and passengers who have been in contact with the U.S. Embassy in China. The flight is intended primarily to evacuate staff of the U.S. Consulate in Wuhan during a temporary shutdown of the diplomatic mission. The plane will land in Ontario, Calif., a city about one hour east of Los Angeles, a State Department spokeswoman said Monday. She added that all travelers would be screened for symptoms before departing. During a refueling stop in Anchorage, passengers will disembark into a terminal closed to the general public and receive another health screening before continuing on to California, said Anne Zink, Alaska’s chief medical officer.

While Chinese authorities struggle to control the epidemic and restart their economy, a world that has grown accustomed to contemplating China’s inexorable rise was reminded that nothing, not even Beijing’s power, can be taken for granted. We do not know how dangerous the new coronavirus will be. There are signs that Chinese authorities are still trying to conceal the true scale of the problem, but at this point the virus appears to be more contagious but considerably less deadly than the pathogens behind diseases such as Ebola or SARS—though some experts say SARS and coronavirus are about equally contagious. China’s initial response to the crisis was less than impressive. The Wuhan government was secretive and self-serving; national authorities responded vigorously but, it currently appears, ineffectively. China’s cities and factories are shutting down; the virus continues to spread. We can hope that authorities succeed in containing the epidemic and treating its victims, but the performance to date has shaken confidence in the Chinese Communist Party at home and abroad. Complaints in Beijing about the U.S. refusing entry to noncitizens who recently spent time in China cannot hide the reality that the decisions that allowed the epidemic to spread as far and as fast as it did were all made in Wuhan and Beijing. The likeliest economic consequence of the coronavirus epidemic, forecasters expect, will be a short and sharp fall in Chinese economic growth rates during the first quarter, recovering as the disease fades. The most important longer-term outcome would appear to be a strengthening of a trend for global companies to “de-Sinicize” their supply chains. Add the continuing public health worries to the threat of new trade wars, and supply-chain diversification begins to look prudent. Events like the coronavirus epidemic, and its predecessors—such as SARS, Ebola and MERS—test our systems and force us to think about the unthinkable. If there were a disease as deadly as Ebola and as fast-spreading as coronavirus, how should the U.S. respond? What national and international systems need to be in place to minimize the chance of catastrophe on this scale? Epidemics also lead us to think about geopolitical and economic hypotheticals. We have seen financial markets shudder and commodity prices fall in the face of what hopefully will be a short-lived disturbance in China’s economic growth. What would happen if—perhaps in response to an epidemic, but more likely following a massive financial collapse—China’s economy were to suffer a long period of even slower growth? What would be the impact of such developments on China’s political stability, on its attitude toward the rest of the world, and to the global balance of power? China’s financial markets are probably more dangerous in the long run than China’s wildlife markets. Given the accumulated costs of decades of state-driven lending, massive malfeasance by local officials in cahoots with local banks, a towering property bubble, and vast industrial overcapacity, China is as ripe as a country can be for a massive economic correction. Even a small initial shock could lead to a massive bonfire of the vanities as all the false values, inflated expectations and misallocated assets implode. If that comes, it is far from clear that China’s regulators and decision makers have the technical skills or the political authority to minimize the damage—especially since that would involve enormous losses to the wealth of the politically connected. We cannot know when or even if a catastrophe of this scale will take place, but students of geopolitics and international affairs—not to mention business leaders and investors—need to bear in mind that China’s power, impressive as it is, remains brittle. A deadlier virus or a financial-market contagion could transform China’s economic and political outlook at any time. Many now fear the coronavirus will become a global pandemic. The consequences of a Chinese economic meltdown would travel with the same sweeping inexorability. Commodity prices around the world would slump, supply chains would break down, and few financial institutions anywhere could escape the knock-on consequences. Recovery in China and elsewhere could be slow, and the social and political effects could be dramatic. If Beijing’s geopolitical footprint shrank as a result, the global consequences might also be surprising. Some would expect a return of unipolarity if the only possible great-power rival to the U.S. were to withdraw from the game. Yet in the world of American politics, isolation rather than engagement might surge to the fore. If the China challenge fades, many Americans are likely to assume that the U.S. can safely reduce its global commitments. So far, the 21st century has been an age of black swans. From 9/11 to President Trump’s election and Brexit, low-probability, high-impact events have reshaped the world order. That age isn’t over, and of the black swans still to arrive, the coronavirus epidemic is unlikely to be the last to materialize in China. Copyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

That would reduce, if not eliminate, reliance on Huawei equipment.

Almost no one outside the church knew about it. Some of that mystery evaporated late last year when a former employee revealed in a whistleblower complaint with the Internal Revenue Service that the fund, called Ensign Peak Advisors, had stockpiled $100 billion. The whistleblower also alleged that the church had improperly used some Ensign Peak funds. Officials of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, colloquially known as the Mormon Church, denied those claims. They also declined to comment on how much money their investment fund controls. “We’ve tried to be somewhat anonymous,” Roger Clarke, the head of Ensign Peak, said from the firm’s fourth-floor office, above a Salt Lake City food court. Ensign Peak doesn’t appear in that building’s directory. Interviews with more than a dozen former employees and business partners provide a deeper look inside an organization that ballooned from a shoestring operation in the 1990s into a behemoth rivaling Wall Street’s largest firms.

The 2019 novel coronavirus marks the third leap of its kind in 20 years following the SARS virus, which moved from bats to a mammal called a civet and then to humans beginning in 2002, and the Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS, which was transmitted from camels in 2012. “This outbreak is a lesson for us. On a global scale, human population density, wildlife diversity, and land use change is what drives new pandemics,” said Dr. Peter Daszak, president of EcoHealth Alliance, a U.S. based nonprofit organization that has been studying the origins of SARS and related viruses in China for 15 years. “What we’re doing on this planet is driving the risk higher because it’s pushing us closer to these wildlife and their viruses.” Finding the answer to the origin of the new coronavirus could guide policy decisions that would reduce risks of another outbreak. Epidemiologists say that while bats look like the likely culprit, a definitive answer could take years of detective work that involves interviews, and the sampling and testing of patients and animals. In January, researchers in China analyzed samples taken from infected patients with severe pneumonia and obtained full sequences of their genome, or genetic material.  "

The president’s State of the Union address stressed the administration’s commitment to space, “which is backed up by the 2021 budget numbers,” said a spokesman for the White House Office of Management and Budget. “Space exploration will reinvigorate the landscape of American science,” the spokesman said, adding that eventually it will result in a human mission to Mars, part of a broader strategy to reassert America’s space dominance.

Beginning Feb. 14, China will cut tariffs on some U.S. goods to 5% from 10%, while levies on some other items will be reduced to 2.5% from 5%, China’s Ministry of Finance said Thursday. The tariffs were imposed in September and December during a brutal trade fight between the world’s two largest economies. The U.S. has already laid out plans to reduce the tariff rate on certain imports from China that have been penalized in the trade war, although most tariffs will remain. Starting Feb. 14, the U.S. will lower tariffs on roughly $120 billion in Chinese goods—including electronics and apparel—to 7.5%, from 15% currently, the U.S. trade representative’s office said on Jan. 22. That also fulfills a pledge made under the U.S.-China trade agreement signed Jan. 15. The tariff cuts come amid growing doubts about Beijing’s ability to follow through on the phase-one trade deal, in which China has pledged to boost its purchases of American merchandise and services by $200 billion over two years. A coronavirus outbreak that began in China in late January and has spread to more than a dozen countries has caused a near-standstill in economic activity in the country. Chinese authorities have placed many parts of the country on lockdown in an effort to contain the epidemic.  "

It was called “Codebreaker.” This was the beginning of what has turned into one of the biggest scandals in Major League Baseball history. Throughout the 2017 season and for part of 2018, Astros baseball operations employees and video room staffers used Codebreaker to illegally steal signs, which were then relayed to batters in real time. Another Astros employee referred to the system as the “dark arts.” This previously undisclosed information about the origins and nature of the Astros’ cheating comes from both a letter MLB commissioner Rob Manfred sent to Luhnow on Jan. 2 that outlined the findings of a league investigation, as well as interviews with several people familiar with the matter. Eleven days after Manfred’s letter, which was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, MLB announced that it had suspended Luhnow, as well as field manager A.J. Hinch, for the entire 2020 season. Hours later, the Astros fired both Luhnow and Hinch. The existence of Codebreaker shows that it was the Astros front office that laid the groundwork for the team’s electronic sign-stealing schemes.

That digital business was built largely on the company’s 2008 acquisition of the ad-technology firm DoubleClick. Many of the questions center around two moves that Google has made in recent years that publishers and rivals say have helped consolidate its power.

Many investors remain braced for greater volatility ahead. The magnitude of the concern is such that Saudi Arabia’s push for further production cuts among members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries failed to buoy oil prices on Monday.

The agreement, which requires court approval, is expected to be announced next week. The board and the competing factions worked out the rough terms of their bargain during court-mandated mediation in recent months but are still discussing some legal points of disagreement, people familiar with the matter said. Hedge funds including Monarch Alternative Capital LP, GoldenTree Asset Management LP and Whitebox Advisors LLC were part of a committee advocating for owners of the older—or legacy—bonds while a group including Aurelius Capital Management LP and Autonomy Capital negotiated on behalf of investors in the newer bonds. Together, the older and newer bonds total more than $18 billion in debt. Spokesmen for the oversight board, and both bondholder groups declined to comment.  "

The document, filed Friday and reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, accuses prosecutors of sending such a request to the U.K. when they already had access to similar information. It also says prosecutors delayed following up with their British counterparts, which, according to the author, former federal prosecutor Ankush Khardori, showed they didn’t urgently need that information. Representatives of the Justice Department and its inspector general declined to comment about the memo. If the allegations in the memo are determined to be true, they could indicate that the Justice Department has bent the rules in a way that damaged defendants’ rights. Suspects in many federal crimes can’t be charged more than five years after the crime has been committed. Such statutes of limitations were enacted to protect possible defendants from being accused long after a crime, when memories had faded and evidence may have disappeared. Responses to mutual legal-assistance treaty requests, or MLATs, sometimes take months or years, so prosecutors can ask a federal judge under seal to suspend the statute of limitations for up to three years on a crime they are investigating while they seek foreign evidence for their case.

Prosecutors have doubled down on their effort to curtail this form of market manipulation, with four former traders scheduled to stand trial this year. The Justice Department’s Fraud Section, which focuses on white-collar crime, dedicated a special team last year to rooting out the conduct. In recent weeks, two former traders alleged to have deceived markets with spoofed orders were sentenced to time served. On Tuesday, a federal judge in Chicago allowed one of them, Jiongsheng “Jim” Zhao, to return home to Australia. Mr. Zhao spent 10 months in an Australian prison before being extradited to the U.S. and pleading guilty. “We need to flush this trading behavior out of the system in these markets in order to protect the integrity of them,” said Assistant Attorney General Brian Benczkowski, who oversees the DOJ’s criminal division. Critics of the government’s campaign say prosecutors have turned routine, if cunning, behavior into a crime on par with insider trading. Some traders say spoofing, a form of bluffing that entails entering bogus orders and quickly canceling them, is hard to distinguish in markets where algorithmic traders constantly post, cancel and update prices.

In 2017, WikiLeaks released more than 8,000 pages of secret materials—which the antisecrecy organization called “Vault 7”—detailing the CIA’s cyberespionage arsenal, including the agency’s playbook for hacking smartphones, computer operating systems, messaging applications and internet-connected televisions. It was one of the largest breaches in the agency’s history. Federal prosecutors say the defendant, Joshua Schulte, stole the documents when he worked in a CIA unit that designed the hacking tools. Mr. Schulte, 31 years old, faces 11 criminal counts, including illegal gathering and transmission of national defense information—charges that derive from the Espionage Act, a statute that has been applied in other WikiLeaks cases. Some of the charges relate to Mr. Schulte’s alleged misconduct and obstruction following his 2017 arrest—prosecutors say he lied to law enforcement and disobeyed court orders. Mr. Schulte and his lawyers have called the espionage charges vague and overreaching, saying they infringed on constitutional free-speech rights. They have alleged fatal errors in the government’s case, objected to the secrecy shrouding the investigation and protested Mr. Schulte’s isolated confinement in a Manhattan jail.  "

More than 20,000 cases have been confirmed in China, with another 23,000 suspected. Many in China aren’t even being tested due to a shortage of diagnostic supplies. The true number infected is likely much higher than reported. The virus has turned up in 28 other countries, including the U.S. A pandemic seems inevitable. The U.S. government has moved quickly to try to delay the spread throughout America. As of Feb. 2, most foreign nationals who have traveled in China in the preceding 14 days aren’t able to enter the country. Americans and their immediate family who recently traveled to China are subject to medical screening and quarantine. These travel measures may stall a U.S. outbreak. But they’ll become less effective as more cases appear outside China. It’s clear that China waited several weeks to tell the world about the outbreak. Meanwhile, roughly 250,000 Chinese nationals traveled to the U.S. People with only mild symptoms can spread the virus to close contacts. So far the 11 known U.S. cases are recent travelers to Wuhan and their household contacts. But it’s highly probable that dozens of other cases have gone undetected. The first sign of an outbreak will be a cluster of patients in one community stricken with unexplained pneumonia. The priority should be identifying this community transmission early, so that public-health authorities can intervene and prevent spread throughout the U.S. That will require several steps. First, doctors must be on high alert. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention should expand its guidance to doctors: Be suspicious of anyone with unexplained pneumonia who tests negative for common viruses, even if the patient has no connection to China.

The new charges amp up pressure on Huawei from the U.S., where Trump administration officials are fighting to persuade allies to lock the telecommunications giant out of their next generation mobile networks because of national security concerns. The U.S. has long said Huawei could be coerced by Beijing into using its equipment to spy on, or disrupt, foreign networks, which the company denies. The new indictment, filed in federal court in Brooklyn, N.Y., builds on allegations the U.S. leveled in January 2019 accusing Huawei of financial fraud and violating U.S. sanctions on Iran. Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn said the new charges related to a decadeslong effort by Huawei and its subsidiaries, in the U.S. and China, to steal intellectual property, including from six U.S. technology companies. The charges closely track a series of allegations by companies identifiable as  Cisco Technology Inc.,   T-Mobile US Inc.,   Motorola Inc.,  and others documented in a Wall Street Journal article last year. Prosecutors said Huawei’s efforts were successful and resulted in the company obtaining nonpublic intellectual property about robotics, cellular-antenna technology and internet-router source code. The alleged thefts allowed the company to cut costs and research-and-development delays, giving it an unfair competitive advantage, according to prosecutors.  "

The high-level firings of the Communist Party secretaries of both Hubei province and its capital of Wuhan helped to put some distance between the outbreak and the central government in Beijing. News of the sackings spread quickly on Chinese social media on Thursday, with citizens praising the moves. Chinese state media said a protégé of Chinese President Xi Jinping, Shanghai Mayor Ying Yong, would be Hubei’s new Communist Party secretary, a position with the equivalent responsibilities of a U.S. governor, succeeding Jiang Chaoliang. China also fired Wuhan’s party secretary, Ma Guoqiang, state media said. He was succeeded by Wang Zhonglin, who had been the party secretary of Jinan, another provincial capital. The majority of the fatalities and infections during the outbreak have occurred in Hubei, a province of nearly 60 million people that has been almost entirely locked down to halt a contagion believed to have started late last year at a Wuhan market with live, wild animals. Hundreds of other officials have been penalized and dozens were fired for not properly performing their duties during the outbreak, according to a review of Chinese government notices. But most had been lower-ranking, raising questions about how far up the ladder the punishments would go.  "

Like him or hate him, there’s tons of spilled ink trying to assess President Trump’s governing style. To me, the key to understanding Trumpism is remembering why he was elected. What do I mean? Voters chose Donald Trump as an antidote to the growing inflammation caused by the (OK, deep breath . . .) prosperity-crushing, speech-inhibiting, nanny state-building, carbon-obsessing, patriarchy-bashing, implicit bias-accusing, tokey-wokey, globalist, swamp-creature governing class—all perfectly embodied by the Democrats’ 2016 nominee. On taking office, Mr. Trump proceeded to hire smart people and create a massive diversion (tweets, border walls, tariffs) as a smokescreen to let them implement an agenda of tax cuts, deregulation and originalist judges. Those reforms have left the market free to do its magic and got the economy grooving like it’s 1999. The daily Trump hurricane—like the commotion over the Chiefs from Kansas—makes the media focus on the all-powerful wizard while ignoring the policy makers behind the curtain. Alfred Hitchcock called this kind of distraction a “MacGuffin”—something that moves the plot along and provides motivation for the characters, but is itself unimportant, insignificant or irrelevant. It can be a kind of sleight of hand, a distraction, and Mr. Trump uses his own public persona as a MacGuffin in precisely that way. The mobs decked in “Resist” jewelry fall for it every time. For example, Sen. Bernie Sanders used his remarks during the Senate impeachment trial to point out that the media had documented some 16,200 alleged lies by President Trump. The MacGuffin worked! Mr. Sanders and his peers are focused on the president’s words, while most voters see the real plot unfolding in America—millions of jobs and rising wages.  "

When telecom-equipment makers sell hardware such as switching gear, base stations and antennas to cellphone carriers—which assemble the networks that enable mobile communication and computing—they are required by law to build in ways for authorities to tap into the networks for lawful purposes. These companies also are required to make sure they themselves can’t gain access without the consent of the network operator. Only law-enforcement officials or authorized officials at carriers are allowed into these “lawful interception interfaces.” Such access is governed by laws and protocols in each country.  "

Five European and Asian container ship operators told the Journal they are preparing profit warnings for the first half or the full year. Top news and in-depth analysis on the world of logistics, from supply chain to transport and technology. Asking not to be named, senior executives at five European and Asian container ship operators told the Journal that their companies are preparing profit warnings for the first half or the full year. Ocean cargo carriers had been hoping for a rebound in business with the easing of the trade showdown between the U.S. and China. “If this continues you will see a sea of red this year. It’s really bad,” said the chief financial officer of a large Asian box-ship company, asking not to be named. A Shanghai broker said at least one container ship that can move more than 20,000 containers left Shanghai for Northern Europe with only 2,000 full containers. “It will pick up more at ports on its way, but loading data show it will reach Europe around 35% full,” this broker said. “That’s unprecedented, and a lot of money is being lost because it doesn’t even cover the fuel cost.” Sea-Intelligence said in a report this week that more than 350,000 containers have been removed from global trade since the outbreak of the virus led China to impose large travel restrictions at the end of the country’s Lunar New Year holiday break.  Companies exporting goods into China are also facing problems because only a fraction of workers are back at work to handle goods arriving at ports. That has backed up cargo at terminals and warehouses at big gateways including Shanghai, Tianjin and Ningbo. “It [congestion] is due to inbound shipments that have either not been cleared by customs brokers or for which delivery and pick-up services could not be arranged,” said Resilience360, which monitors risks across supply chains and is owned by Deutsche Post DHL. A broker in Singapore said there is an “acute shortage” of power plugs for refrigerated containers that move fresh produce in Ningbo because there are no workers at terminals. He said some cargo has been diverted from several mainland ports to Hong Kong, which some carriers and shippers are now using as an alternative entry point for goods that are then trucked into China. A group representing U.S. agriculture exporters warned its members this week to ensure that ocean carriers can store their goods on arrival in China, particularly items like meat, vegetables and fruit that require refrigeration. American exporters are seeing cargo backed up even at U.S. hubs because of the congestion in China’s distribution networks. Brokers said crude and natural gas shipments are down by nearly half across China’s main ports. Daily freight rates for big crude tankers have fallen to between $10,000 and $40,000, from up to $80,000 at the start of the year. Norway-based BW Energy, which operates the world’s biggest fleet of gas carriers that move products like propane, this week cut its projected valuation for an initial public offering at the Oslo Exchange from $$700 million to $500 million. “The offering period has coincided with significant volatility in the global financial markets due to the outbreak of the coronavirus in China, which has also triggered a material downward movement in the oil price,” the company said. The China Association of the National Shipbuilding Industry said more than 200 deliveries of ships under repairs or retrofitting could be pushed back. China is the world’s biggest shipbuilder, with more than 960 vessels set to be delivered this year, according to data provider VesselsValue. “The Chinese players are facing significant challenges in fulfilling their contracts because they are not able to operate at full capacity after the Lunar New Year holiday,” the shipbuilding group said.

Growth in global trade sank to a meager 1% last year, down from 4% in 2018 and 6% in 2017. It was the fourth worst showing in 40 years, and the worst ever outside a period of recession, according to International Monetary Fund data. Several factors contributed to the slowdown, but analysts say the U.S.-China trade war was the single-biggest cause. The U.S. and China are the world’s great buying engines, each pulling in over $2 trillion a year of goods. Trade between the two nations slowed as a result of tariffs and other measures, and the decline couldn’t be entirely made up by purchases from other countries. Behind the slump were falling U.S. sales to China of agriculture products, aircraft and machinery, while China’s sales of electronics and industrial supplies to the U.S. dropped. In some cases foreign suppliers were unable to fill the void, so many measures of factory activity and demand slid.  "

It’s just, ‘Hey, can you send me that paper?’ ” said Ms. McCraw, a teacher and principal at a tiny school in rural Paicines, Calif. Texting may be second nature to many kids, but composing an email seems like an ancient craft. And making calls—or answering one from a stranger? That’s so last century. Educators and parents are trying to teach kids digital etiquette so that when they enter the workforce, they will be able to communicate using words instead of abbreviations and emojis. Ms. McCraw is so serious about it that she has made email composition a part of her students’ language arts grade. Each week she has her middle-school students email her about assignments they have completed in Google documents, just to get them in the habit. If the memos don’t contain a subject line, a salutation and a signature, they get marked down. Still, she doesn’t often email them. So when she sent her students an email last year to congratulate them on their hard work, they printed it out. “They thought it was so cute. It was as if they were getting a greeting card in the mail,” Ms. McCraw said. “They think email is antiquated because they’re all on WhatsApp, but email is still the number one form of communication in the workplace and it’s so important for their college and career readiness.”  "

But they have been thrust to the front line of the fight against the coronavirus that has infected nearly 36,000 in Wuhan and overwhelmed local officials and the health-care system in this city of 11 million. Ms. Xiao and her team of nine workers have worked in shifts around the clock at a spartan office to assist 3,700 people living in the Golden Dragon Garden residential complex. They have comforted family members, delivered vegetables, arranged car rides, and answered the constant phone calls from residents who need help. On Friday, she stood outside her office in a thick hooded, knee-length coat and a surgical mask, describing the worst moments of the outbreak. “This ear hurt,” she said, pointing to her right side. “My arm didn’t have enough strength to hold up the phone. I had to charge my phone again and again.” Ms. Xiao and her team have kept temperature records for all of the residents. They have also made in-person visits to peoples’ apartments, even as they were unsure if they themselves could get infected with the virus. The virus has now infected more than 63,000 people across China and killed at least 1,380. The majority of cases have been in Wuhan’s surrounding province of Hubei. The number of documented infections in the province jumped by more than 18,000 on Wednesday and Thursday after authorities adopted a broader diagnosis classification. Straining to keep up, the government has added thousands of beds by opening treatment centers and repurposing hotels as quarantine centers. It has tasked community committees with categorizing and isolating residents in different facilities depending on the severity of their exposure. “No one should be left behind,” the province’s outbreak response team said last week after announcing the new policy. Residents who didn’t comply would face legal punishment, it added, without offering specifics. Families have chafed at having overworked committee staff involved in making health-care decisions. At a different apartment complex in Wuhan’s Chezhan neighborhood, the residential committee first decided to quarantine Zhu Qingmei at a hotel without medical care, she said, even though she was so sick that she had trouble breathing. As the 55-year-old’s illness worsened and she was confirmed to have the virus, Ms. Zhu asked to be admitted to a hospital. Her residential committee instead arranged for her to go to a convention center that had been turned into a field hospital for patients with milder symptoms. Ms. Zhu waited for hours at the back of a pickup truck at the field hospital’s entrance before medical staff inside found out her blood oxygen levels were dangerously low and sent her to a hospital that specialized in ear, nose and throat care. She spent two days there before finally being transferred to a hospital designated to treat the coronavirus. “It was like they just wanted to finish their task,” she said. “When I came out of the field hospital, it was like I lost half my life. I couldn’t speak and breathing was difficult.” The Chezhan district committee, which oversees Ms. Zhu’s apartment complex, declined a request for an interview. A spokeswoman for the committee said some cases might have been mismanaged, but only because officials were overwhelmed. Health officials worry that the overburdened system is exposing healthy people to the virus. Earlier this month, one residential committee accidentally sent a confirmed case for quarantine to a hotel that was meant only for people who had been in close contact with virus patients. A driver assigned by the committee, who was wearing only a surgical mask for protection, had picked up a mother who had been infected, instead of her daughter who didn’t have symptoms. “It’s such a mess,” said Mr. Xia, a district health commission officer who was on duty at the hotel. He declined to give his first name. “It’s going to get others infected.” The city fired the director of one district committee for mismanaging dozens of critically ill patients, according to the city’s party-run Changjiang Daily newspaper. It reprimanded and gave a disciplinary warning to two others, one of them for mistakenly sending severely-ill patients to the wrong hospital. Officials “should make disease prevention the most important political task,” it said. At the Golden Dragon community, one resident took to the social-media platform Weibo to complain that the committee had refused to quarantine her and her husband, who were both sick. “The virus isn’t scary so much as people’s intentions,” she wrote. “Do you want to quarantine me or have me die?” The committee later arranged for the resident’s husband, 44-year old Xu Weijie, to move to a hotel for monitoring and quarantine.  VIEW In Depth While admitting to struggles, community committees said they had assisted many in need. There has been progress, with nearly 1,500 seriously-ill coronavirus patients getting admitted to hospitals in a matter of two days, Wuhan’s former Communist Party secretary, Ma Guoqiang, said earlier this week. Reinforcements have recently begun to arrive as the government brings in workers from state-owned enterprises and volunteers to help. In Golden Dragon, about 40 residents have come down with fevers since the outbreak began, according to the community committee. Roughly half had regular colds while another 10 were confirmed to have the virus that causes Covid-19 and put in hospitals. Nine other suspected cases were either put in hospitals or transferred to hotels for testing. Ms. Xiao said she started her job on the committee nearly two decades ago, not long before China suffered an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS. This outbreak has felt more serious, she said. Hubei registered only seven infections and one death from SARS in 2003.

Ms. Xiao, the committee’s party secretary, said she is in touch with every sick patient through            WeChat,      a popular Chinese app, and her team rejoices each time an infected resident is able to secure a hospital bed. Looking back, she said, she’s not sure how she and her team got through the previous weeks. Trying to contain the outbreak has been grueling and terrifying, according to Ms. Xiao, who said she typically doesn’t get home until midnight. After walking in the door, she sprays her clothes down with alcohol and takes a shower, worried she’ll bring the virus back to her family. She said she has noticed a change among residents recently. There is less fear, and the discussions in the WeChat group are starting to return to the mundane topics of everyday life, like how to bake cakes and cook pizza. Still, she feels the battle against the virus is far from over. “I’m scared to be optimistic,” she said. —Kersten Zhang contributed to this article.

So it’s a pity he would level one of his own against fellow New Yorker and potential presidential rival Michael Bloomberg. In a now-deleted tweet, the President wrote “WOW, BLOOMBERG IS A TOTAL RACIST!” The President was reacting to the release of an audio snippet from a 2015 Aspen Institute speech that may have been leaked by a rival Democratic presidential campaign. Mr. Bloomberg was defending a police tactic called stop, question and frisk, which helped drive violent crime to record lows during his time as New York City’s mayor. In their imperious insensitivity, the remarks are vintage Bloomberg, whether he’s talking about how you could hand cops a Xeroxed description (“male, minorities, 16 to 25”) to fit 95% of the city’s murder cases—or saying “the way you get the guns out of the kids’ hands is to throw them up against the walls and frisk them.” But as politically incorrect as it may have been, Mr. Bloomberg was basically speaking the truth that New York City’s minority neighborhoods were among those with the highest crime rates, and that by sending cops there it inevitably meant minority citizens were more likely to be stopped and arrested. The issue is more politically complicated now because Mr. Bloomberg recently apologized for stop and frisk before he announced his run for President. In a statement Tuesday, he noted that he had cut stop-and-frisk searches 95% by the time he left office but again apologized for not having done it “faster and sooner.”  "

In Beijing and elsewhere, Chinese diplomats have pitched the crisis as a test of friendship, calling on foreign governments not to suspend travel links with China or to evacuate their citizens—measures Beijing decries as unnecessary, fear-inducing and unfriendly. “True friendship emerges in times of adversity,” Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying has repeated in recent weeks.

The Justice Department’s move to withdraw the recommendation it made on Monday to a U.S. judge and propose a more lenient one came hours after President Trump criticized in a tweet the original request that Mr. Stone spend more than seven years behind bars. After the reversal became public, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan Kravis, one of the government attorneys who prosecuted Mr. Stone, withdrew from the case and resigned from his post, according to a court filing. Three other prosecutors, Special Assistant U.S. Attorneys Aaron Zelinksy and Adam Jed and Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Marando, also said in court filings that they were withdrawing from the case. The fast-moving developments came one day after prosecutors asked for a seven-to-nine-year sentence following Mr. Stone’s conviction last November for lying to Congress and witness tampering in connection with Robert Mueller’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and any contacts between Russia and the Trump campaign. It was an unusual reversal by the Justice Department, which typically hews to a set of legal guidelines when recommending punishments.  "

This year it sounds like the Democratic campaign theme may be that Iranian terror master Qasem Soleimani is dead and the world is more dangerous because of it. That’s a fair judgment from Friday’s debate in New Hampshire when ABC’s David Muir asked the candidates “if your national security team came to you with an opportunity to strike, would Soleimani have been dead or would he still be alive under your Presidency?” Pete Buttigieg responded: “In the situation that we saw with President Trump’s decision, there is no evidence that made our country safer.” He deplored Soleimani’s “murder and mayhem” but then zagged to the Iraq war, the Iranian nuclear pact, and a wounded veteran friend he saw in an airport. Mr. Muir tried again, but the former mayor came down with a decisive, “It depends on the circumstances.” Mr. Muir then moved to Mr. Biden, who at least didn’t fudge. “No. And the reason I wouldn’t have ordered the strike, there is no evidence yet of imminent threat that was going to come from him,” Mr. Biden said, before veering to “America First policies” and NATO. No mention that bin Laden wasn’t an “imminent threat” by the time he was killed. Next up was Bernie Sanders, who listed several of the world’s “very bad leaders” but said we can’t “assassinate” them because that would open the door to “international anarchy.” He said the only recourse is diplomacy.

The proposal is part of President Trump’s $4.8 trillion federal budget for the fiscal year ending in September 2021. A White House budget isn’t binding; it signals an administration’s areas of focus for congressional budget negotiations in the year ahead. Under the proposal, the government’s overall R&D spending would decline to $142.2 billion from an estimated $156 billion in fiscal 2020, according to a White House budget document.  Within the next two years, annual spending on AI would rise to more than $2 billion and funding for quantum computing would increase to $860 million, according to the White House plan. The proposed increases in AI spending include more than $850 million at the National Science Foundation, $125 million at the Department of Energy’s Office of Science and $100 million at the Agriculture Department, among other agencies. The budget also proposes $50 million in AI and quantum education and job training initiatives, including partnerships with community colleges. “Early-stage research is a high priority,” Kelvin Droegemeier, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, said about proposed AI and quantum funding on a media conference call Monday. U.S. Chief Technology Officer            Michael Kratsios,      also speaking on the call, said the country is facing a “global power competition” for AI, quantum computing and other critical technologies. That includes a fierce rivalry with China, said            Stephen Ezell,      vice president of innovation policy at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, an independent Washington, D.C.-based policy think tank. Mr. Ezell said China wants to establish itself as the world’s primary AI innovation center within the next decade, generating $60 billion in output from AI-based companies and industries by 2025. China-based            Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.      , the world’s largest online shopping market, alone has committed $15 billion over three years for AI, big data, Internet of Things and quantum-computing research, he said. “There’s no doubt that competitors such as China are making serious investments and strategies in an effort to wrest AI and quantum computing leadership,” Mr. Ezell said. Cinnamon Rogers, executive vice president for public policy at tech trade group CompTIA, said the federal spending proposals on AI and quantum computing show the administration is serious about competing with China and other countries. “Doubling down on investments in artificial intelligence and computing R&D is important for innovation and the economy,” Ms. Rogers said. The Center for Data Innovation, a nonpartisan research institute, said in a report last year that China is adopting AI at a faster rate than both the U.S. and the European Union, due in part to government spending. The Trump administration last year committed nearly $1 billion toward AI research, citing a need to maintain a competitive edge in emerging technology. President Trump in 2017 signed into law a bill authorizing spending $1.2 billion over five years toward establishing a National Quantum Initiative aimed at accelerating R&D across the federal government. Investing in U.S. computing-technology startups in the private sector grew to $477.9 million in 2019 from $59.8 million in 2014, including ventures developing both AI and quantum computing capabilities, according to PitchBook Data Inc. Tech giants such as            Alphabet Inc.’s      Google and            International Business Machines Corp.      are also racing to develop quantum computers, which leverage the properties of quantum physics to dramatically speed up the process of parsing data. “AI and quantum technologies serve as force multipliers to the entire R&D enterprise of the U.S.,”            Dario Gil,      director of IBM Research, said in an email, adding that the company supports the administration’s spending plans.

More than 5,400 people had been asked to self-quarantine in California alone as of Feb. 14, according to the California Department of Public Health. Hundreds more are self-quarantining in Georgia, Washington state, Illinois, New York and other states. Public-health officials are following directions from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the State Department to supervise these people, but many steps are being developed on the fly. States are using a variety of techniques to track people from calling in volunteers to make phone calls, to sending text messages and using electronic registries. These people are separate from the Americans who are under stricter federal quarantine, including those housed at four U.S. air bases and the 328 who were recently evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship. Those groups arrived from locations where the virus was rapidly spreading, whereas the people self-monitoring at home are thought to be at lower risk of having been exposed to it. So far, there have been 15 confirmed Covid-19 cases in the U.S., not including the potentially positive cases among those evacuated from the Diamond Princess. While health officials have investigated 479 people for the virus as of Wednesday, 412 tested negative, with 52 cases pending, according to the CDC. The immediate risk to the general public is still low, health officials say.  "

Patient No. 12 had booked seats E13 and E14 for a 5:30 p.m. showing of the South Korean film, “The Man Standing Next.” Before grabbing a 12:40 p.m. train, patient No. 17 dined at a soft-tofu restaurant in Seoul. Patient No. 21 drove her car to attend a weekday evening church service. The reports, a digital diary of the individual’s life a few days before contracting the coronavirus, are made public on a Ministry of Health and Welfare website. Travel details of all 29 confirmed cases are noted in bullet points. The online travel logs are made possible by one of the most ambitious tracking apparatuses in Asia. Health authorities can sift through credit-card records, CCTV footage, mobile-phone location services, public-transport cards and immigration records to pin down the travel histories of those infected or at risk. Along with other preventive measures such as entry bans and quarantines, the tracking system has been used to limit the spread of the virus from China, the source of the outbreak. As of Saturday, South Korea has 29 confirmed Covid-19 cases, a modest total compared with China’s other neighbors but still the sixth-largest number after China, Singapore, Hong Kong, Thailand and Japan. While at least nine out of its cases were locally transmitted, no patients have required intensive-care treatment."

Yes, a headline. Or at least that was the official justification. The truth is that Beijing’s rulers are punishing our reporters so they can change the subject from the Chinese public’s anger about the government’s management of the coronavirus scourge. “China Is the Real Sick Man of Asia” was the headline over            Walter Russell Mead’s      Feb. 3 column in the Journal. Mr. Mead, a fellow at the Hudson Institute, writes a weekly column on foreign affairs for us. He did not write the headline. Anyone who reads the piece can see it describes the problems in Chinese governance exposed by the response to the coronavirus outbreak. Beijing has since sacked Wuhan province officials, proving Mr. Mead’s point. As for that headline, we have heard from thoughtful people that to Chinese ears the “sick man” reference echoes in insensitive fashion the West’s exploitation of China in the mid-19th century during the opium wars. Others say it refers to Japan’s 20th-century invasion of China. We take the point, and we were happy to run letters to the editor criticizing the headline. Most Americans, however, understand the phrase in the context of the dying Ottoman Empire as “the sick man of Europe.” That was our historical analogy. These days the “sick man” phrase is used to describe many countries, most notably the Philippines as the sick man of Asia. The Financial Times, the Economist and the Guardian all referred to Britain as “the sick man of Europe” in the throes of Brexit. The Global Times, a publication that expresses Chinese government views, republished a Reuters article in 2016 whose lead sentence referred to Egypt as the “sick man of the Middle East.” In 2011 Foreign Affairs used the headline “The Sick Man of Asia: China’s Health Crisis” over an article by            Yanzhong Huang,      a professor who grew up in China and graduated from Fudan University. In any event, Mr. Mead’s column and headline were never published in China. That’s because the Journal is banned there. Our website has been shut down since 2014. Our reporters can cover China for the rest of the world but not for Chinese readers. That didn’t stop the Chinese government from starting a public campaign against the headline. A Foreign Ministry spokesman denounced the column, and several Chinese propaganda organs spread the same theme. “Racism worse enemy than epidemic,” read a headline in Xinhua lumping Mr. Mead’s article with one from Der Spiegel. Our email inbox was soon flooded with complaints about the headline, all containing remarkably similar language and demanding an apology. A campaign was orchestrated to get Mr. Mead barred from            Twitter.      If you think this was spontaneous outrage, you don’t understand how China’s government works to influence public opinion at home and abroad. Beijing knows how to exploit America’s identity politics to charge “racism” in service of its censorship. And now China has escalated to ban our three reporters, who had nothing to do with the headline or Mr. Mead’s column. As our readers know, and as we have explained to Chinese officials for years, our news and opinion departments are run independently and have separate reporting lines to the publisher.

Sign up here. The Chinese understand this but choose to ignore it when it suits their propaganda purposes. In August they refused to renew the press credentials of a Journal reporter who wrote about the business interests of Mr. Xi’s cousin in Australia. This week the excuse for expulsion is an opinion headline. Soon enough it might be a news story about China’s internment camps for Uighurs in Xinjiang or an editorial about Hong Kong. What Chinese officials don’t understand is that a free press would have helped them better cope with the virus fallout. Democracies are resilient because a free media sends signals and information that allow an outlet for grievances and alert leaders to problems before they become crises. The Chinese also don’t seem to understand that their bullying reduces the shrinking number of allies they still have in the U.S. These columns have supported China’s overall trading relationship with the U.S. even as we criticize some of its trading practices. In the days before Mr. Mead’s column, we ran an editorial (“Wuhan Wilbur Ross”) criticizing the U.S. Commerce Secretary for saying the coronavirus would be an economic benefit for the U.S. Mr. Ross’s point of view will find more American support the more China steals American secrets and banishes reporters. China’s expulsions are so extreme that they surely have more to do with its domestic politics than American opinion. Perhaps they are also in part a response to the State Department’s decision Tuesday to identify the U.S. operations of state-run Chinese media as foreign missions, which subjects them to the same restrictions as embassies. The coronavirus is a seismic political event that undermines Mr. Xi’s promise to his citizens about a rising China and the competence of the Communist Party. The government’s default defense is to play the nationalist card and blame foreigners for its home-grown troubles. That’s why it censors public complaints on Chinese social media, gins up a furor over a headline—and banishes the best reporters in the world from covering China.

Ant Financial said in a social-media post that the national system could be launched as early as this week. Tencent is also working with the central government to expand its system nationwide, the company said. In Hangzhou, users are prompted to enter their personal information and current location when first registering. They then self report their physical condition—choosing from a list of options such as a dry cough, fever or asymptomatic—and are asked if they have traveled in the last 14 days or come into contact with suspected or confirmed coronavirus cases in the same period.

Just as scientists are confronting an unknown enemy, corporate executives are largely working blind because the coronavirus could cause supply-chain disruptions that are unlike anything we have seen in the past 70 years. For now, the best course of action for companies is to analyze possible outcomes in the context of known supply-chain risks based on historical precedents, and to take precautionary measures that minimize exposure to future disruptions. Predictions regarding the impact of the virus range from dire to optimistic. Pessimists draw parallels with the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, which killed tens of millions of people world-wide, and the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. On the other side, optimists foresee an epidemic akin to a typical flu outbreak that will run its course. Top news and in-depth analysis on the world of logistics, from supply chain to transport and technology. From a supply-chain perspective, the disruptions associated with past crises such as the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, that swept across Asia; the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster; or the 2011 Thailand floods are not a good yardstick for the current epidemic. Those events shook specific companies for a relatively short time, but the impact of the coronavirus could be much more sustained. Moreover, the virus formally known as Covid-19 is affecting both supply and demand, so the potential threats are graver than those earlier disruptions. This is especially true because of China’s growth since the SARS crisis as a manufacturing powerhouse and as a major consumer market. Today’s supply chains are global and more complex than they were in 2003. Not only are Chinese factories affected by lockdowns and quarantines, production sites in other countries already are running low on parts for products assembled in China. For example,            Apple Inc.      works with suppliers in 43 countries, all of which receive components from Apple’s contract manufacturers in China. To understand which companies in supply chains are the most vulnerable, one has to understand the so-called supply-chain bullwhip effect. “        The most vulnerable companies are small and leveraged suppliers upstream in the supply chain that are in danger of going under.        ” Assume, for instance, that a retailer experiences an X% drop in demand for a product. It surmises that future sales will be lower too, and so concludes that its current inventories are too high. So the retailer cuts its orders to the wholesaler by twice the amount of the drop in demand. The wholesaler sees that cut in its orders and, using the same logic, cuts the orders to the manufacturer by double that amount, or four times less than the retailer’s drop in demand. The manufacturer reduces its orders to parts suppliers by even more, and so on. At each level of the supply chain the decline in demand sparks a bigger decline in orders from suppliers. Each company reasons that they need to quickly cut production to adjust to declining sales and work off their now-bloated inventory. The most vulnerable companies are small and leveraged suppliers upstream in the supply chain that are in danger of going under. Then-Ford Motor Co. Chief Executive            Alan Mulally      tried to mitigate the impending bullwhip during the 2008 financial crisis by imploring U.S. lawmakers to save his competitors. He argued that if automotive Tier 1 suppliers failed, then their suppliers would also fail, and so on, affecting the entire U.S. automobile industry. When demand revives, the bullwhip pattern reverses as each echelon boosts ordering, both to cover expected higher sales and to quickly replenish depleted inventories. The reverse bullwhip of oscillating orders and inventories strains the ability of production and logistics operations to keep up. After a period during which many upstream suppliers fail and remaining companies fail to deliver during the recovery, a multinational enterprise may find it easier to leave China and set up manufacturing elsewhere. Faced with so many unknowns, companies should take sensible “just in case” steps to prepare for the effects of the coronavirus. 1. Set up a central emergency management center. At this point it can be virtual but should include a clear roster of participants with clear decision-making rules in case of a pandemic. 2. Review the company’s product portfolio and the customer base in order to set priorities. If capacity is reduced, there will need to be rules for which products should be built and which customers should be supplied first. 3. Review suppliers. Who makes critical parts? Are there alternate sources? What is the suppliers’ inventory status? 4. Plan for operating to maximize cash flow rather than profits. 5. Maintain communications with federal and local authorities, as well as Chinese and other Southeast Asian friends and colleagues on the ground. Hoping for the best while preparing for the worst may not seem like a rigorous business approach to the crisis. But given our lack of knowledge, it is the most prudent strategy for managing risk. —            Yossi Sheffi      is director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Center for Transportation and Logistics.

Most social-media companies clamor for the attention of younger users, a tech-savvy, trendsetting cohort that has flocked to TikTok’s playful mix of homemade goofs and influencer-driven memes. Yet the youthful vibe presents a predicament for TikTok because many devotees are under 13. TikTok, which is owned by Chinese conglomerate ByteDance Inc., has worked to broaden its appeal to adults, which it believes is critical to its growth and survival. It has also been trying to boot younger children off the app, and is required to take offline all videos made by children under 13 under a settlement it reached last year with the Federal Trade Commission. But the kids have stuck around. Of 10-year-old girls with smartphones in the U.S., about 70% used TikTok in 2019, according to new data from Jiminy, an app for parents that tracks the smartphone habits of their children. The app’s popularity among younger kids is an extreme example of a dilemma common in the tech industry: Companies struggle to verify the ages of their users without demanding personal details. Children easily circumvent some restrictions designed to keep them out, at times with the help of their parents.  "

It began a year ago when the U.S. stripped India of special low-tariff status over claims it discriminated against American companies. India responded by implementing tariffs it had previously threatened over U.S. steel duties. President Trump travels to India next week where he may reach some sort of truce with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. But the underlying conflict will likely persist, because it is driven by forces similar to those behind the trade war with China. In essence, Mr. Modi seeks to replicate the formula that made China the world’s No. 2 economy by welcoming foreign investment while protecting more of the domestic market for Indian companies. India doesn’t pose the same economic or geopolitical threat China does, but it is currently on a collision course with Mr. Trump, who is determined to punish any country that he thinks is taking advantage of the U.S. India’s protectionist streak goes way back. Its first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, leader of the Indian National Congress party, saw socialism and import-substitution as key to the country’s development and self-sufficiency. A foreign-exchange crisis in the early 1990s led to a wave of liberalization under both Congress and a coalition led by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) that touched off a period of rapid growth in the 2000s. Yet extensive regulations, licenses, state control of banks and other key industries, and capricious policy-making continued to hamper entrepreneurship and investment. Mr. Modi promised to change that when he led the BJP back to power in 2014 on a platform of “minimum government, maximum governance.” He used his remarks to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in 2018 to defend globalization against “the forces of protectionism.”  "

In Hong Kong,  Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. —already feeling the impact of the city’s antigovernment protests—has asked all its staff to take three weeks’ unpaid leave, while Hong Kong Airlines Ltd. has sacked more than 400 workers.

China’s rise to the world’s second busiest aviation market after the U.S. has been a strong source of growth for all the world’s major airlines, which have expanded direct services to Chinese destinations in recent years, some offering dozens of flights a week.  American Airlines Group Inc.’s  namesake carrier, for example, normally operates 28 weekly flights between the U.S. and China. But that has left them badly exposed to major disruption in China.

Data released Monday show Japan’s economy contracted in the last three months of 2019 as the tax hike hammered growth—as many warned and like the previous two times the tax has been raised since its 1989 introduction, in 1997 and 2014. Japan’s economy contracted by 6.3% on an annual basis from October to December. Plummeting consumer spending, which fell by 11.5%, is the main culprit. No wonder since Prime Minister Shinzo Abe raised the consumption-tax rate to 10% from 8% on October 1. Some of the drop-off is a result of consumers trying to front-run the tax hike by ramping up consumption earlier in the year. Don’t expect a major reprieve once the VAT shock wears off. Wage growth is anemic despite a tight labor market, and the Labor Ministry calculates that inflation-adjusted pay fell 3.5% from 2012-2018. The tax rise creates a new and higher squeeze on household incomes. The timing of the increase couldn’t be worse coming before the coronavirus outbreak in China, which depressed tourism and consumption during the lunar new year in January. Mr. Abe has managed to throttle Japan’s economy at precisely the moment it most needs resilience. Some analysts fear Japan is already in a consumption-tax-and-coronavirus recession, which is defined by two quarters in a row of negative growth. The usual suspects are now calling for more Keynesian spending on public works and social spending. Three decades of similar blowouts have created the fiscal mess that always becomes justification for more consumption-tax hikes. Japan’s government debt is now about 240% of GDP.  "

Dressed in her Sunday finest, she fills a bag of groceries at the local market and at the last moment, as though it had slipped her mind, adds a 12-pack of lager. Then, feigning surprise that she can’t afford the bill, she puts all the food back on the shelves. It doesn’t matter that the shopkeeper has seen the charade dozens of times, or that Agnes’s benders are notorious throughout her Glasgow neighborhood. “Every day with the make-up on and her hair done, she climbed out of her grave and held her head high,” Mr. Stuart writes. “When she had disgraced herself with drink, she got up the next day, put on her best coat, and faced the world.” That world is Glasgow in the 1980s, a city “losing its purpose” amid the shuttering of its manufacturing industries. Agnes’s worthless tomcatting husband has run off and she lives with her three kids on the crumbs of weekly disability checks in a rundown housing scheme in the city’s northern mining district. The older children escape when they can, leaving behind Shuggie, whom Agnes has molded from infancy into a companion, apologist and enabler, the sole person who will endure her alcoholism forever. Titling the novel after Shuggie rather than the woman who dominates him seems like small gesture of defiance on Mr. Stuart’s part. Shuggie is a pariah twice over, both because of his allegiance to his mother and because of the effeminate tendencies that single him out to bullies and sexual predators. Both are legion in the novel’s unvarnished characterization of Glasgow’s slums, where a brutal, caveman masculinity has developed in proportion to how trapped and useless the men have become. If the portrayal is unsparing, it is also familial, because Mr. Stuart vividly inhabits the city’s singular “Weegie” dialect and vocabulary. When Agnes first moves to the housing project she assumes that most of the neighboring women are tying one on by midday as well. “No, hen, we’re drinking piss-cold tea,” one says scoldingly. “It’s only ye who’s neckin’ vodka like it was tap water.” But most of all, “Shuggie Bain” is a novel of addiction, and as is the way with addicts, Agnes belligerently demands the bulk of the book’s attention. There is a powerful, if wearying, consistency in her perpetual relapses, her outrageous lies and public spectacles, as well as in Shuggie’s thwarted attempts to get out from under her.

And the way they were doing a virus quarantine on the Diamond Princess cruise ship didn’t look right. Dr. Hopland, a passenger, counted as many as 10 interactions a day with staff coming to deliver meals, toiletries and chocolate to keep up spirits. Passengers were drying laundry on their balconies without wearing face masks. Some leaned over to talk to their next-door neighbors. As the two-week quarantine comes to an end Wednesday, the result of such holes is becoming clear. On Tuesday, the number of passengers and crew who caught the novel coronavirus passed 500, Japan’s government said, offering new evidence that the quarantine failed to stop more people from getting infected. Just before he was supposed to get on a U.S.-chartered plane back home with his wife, Regina, Dr. Hopland got a knock on his cabin door and learned the hard way what could happen when his warnings weren’t heeded: Mrs. Hopland tested positive for the novel coronavirus. He also found out his room steward had taken ill. Mrs. Hopland, 74, is in a Tokyo-area hospital now, while Dr. Hopland, 75, who was told he didn’t have the virus, remains on board. “I was surprised I was negative because I knew the virus had swept through this boat like wildfire,” said Dr. Hopland. “My analogy is they put us in a petri dish to get infected.”  "

Democrats must gain three seats to take control of the Senate, if they win the White House, too. If Mr. Trump is re-elected, Democrats need to net four seats to overcome a tiebreaking vote by Vice President Mike Pence. Democrats have an inherent advantage over the GOP this election cycle that has nothing to do with impeachment: Republicans are defending more seats. There are 23 Republican-held seats up in 2020, compared with 12 Democratic-held seats. After the Senate voted, largely along party lines, to acquit Mr. Trump on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters that in all of Republicans’ competitive Senate races, GOP candidates were in better shape than they had been a month earlier. “I think you’d have to conclude from this episode that we won and they lost,” he said. That was the opposite of how the Senate’s Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, saw it. He said impeachment had been a positive force for Democrats.  "

Moderna on Monday sent vaccine vials from its Norwood, Mass., manufacturing plant to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Md., the company said. The institute expects by the end of April to start a clinical trial of about 20 to 25 healthy volunteers, testing whether two doses of the shot are safe and induce an immune response likely to protect against infection, NIAID Director            Anthony Fauci      said in an interview. Initial results could become available in July or August. Moderna’s turnaround time in producing the first batch of the vaccine—co-designed with NIAID, after learning the new virus’s genetic sequence in January—is a stunningly fast response to an emerging outbreak. If a trial starts as planned in April, it would be about three months from vaccine design to human testing. In comparison, after an outbreak of an older coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome, in China in 2002, it took about 20 months for NIAID to get a vaccine into the first stage of human testing, according to Dr. Fauci. “Going into a Phase One trial within three months of getting the sequence is unquestionably the world indoor record. Nothing has ever gone that fast,” Dr. Fauci said. Public-health authorities say advances in vaccine technology, aided by government and private investments, are shortening development timelines when outbreaks occur. In the past, researchers scrambled to develop vaccines in response to outbreaks such as SARS, Ebola and Zika with mixed results. Older types of vaccines are developed from viral proteins that must be grown in eggs or cell cultures, and together with animal testing it can take years before a vaccine can be used in humans. Newer approaches rely on what are known as platform technologies—building blocks that can be tweaked quickly with the genetic information from a newly emerged pathogen. The fast production of a vaccine and plans to test it soon don’t guarantee its success. “You’re never sure until you’re at the end what you have,” said            Bruce Gellin,      president of global immunization at the Sabin Vaccine Institute. Saying there are other coronavirus vaccines in the works, he added: “The sequence of testing is designed to sort out what works from what doesn’t. That’s why it’s important to try as many things as possible that seem feasible, because not all horses will finish the race.” It is uncertain whether Moderna’s vaccine will work because its gene-based technology hasn’t yet yielded an approved human vaccine. And even if the first study is positive, the coronavirus vaccine might not become widely available until next year because further studies and regulatory clearances will be needed, Dr. Fauci said. But health authorities say it is worth placing bets on these new technologies in the face of fast-moving outbreaks. Since early January, when only a few dozen cases were confirmed in central China, the virus has spread to more than 79,000 people, including more than 2,600 who have died. The vast majority of the cases are in China, according to the World Health Organization. Dr. Fauci said it is possible the spread of coronavirus could lessen during warmer months, but then return next winter and become a seasonal virus like the flu, making a vaccine useful even if it isn’t ready for widespread distribution until next year. “The only way you can completely suppress an emerging infectious disease is with a vaccine,” Dr. Fauci said in his office in Bethesda. “If you want to really get it quickly, you’re using technologies that are not as time-honored as the standard, what I call antiquated, way of doing it.” Moderna, which has more than 800 employees, was founded in 2010 to develop drugs and vaccines based on what is known as messenger RNA, the genetic molecules that carry instructions from DNA to the body’s cells to make certain proteins. The company is targeting cancer, heart disease and infectious diseases. It hasn’t brought any drugs or vaccines to market. Moderna Chief Executive            Stephane Bancel      said he got in touch with NIAID after hearing about the new China virus while vacationing with his family in France in early January, to discuss collaborating on a vaccine. Chinese scientists found the genetic sequence of the new virus and published it online around Jan. 10. Researchers at NIAID and Moderna analyzed the sequence and homed in on a section they believed was most likely to induce the desired immune response if incorporated into a vaccine. NIAID agreed to run a clinical trial if Moderna could supply a vaccine. Moderna didn’t need actual samples of the virus or its proteins. The company’s vaccines instead contain nucleic acids with genetic codes that instruct the body’s own cells to make certain proteins from the virus that don’t infect a person, but trigger an immune response. Do you think governments and companies are moving quickly enough against the coronavirus epidemic? Why or why not? Join the conversation below. Moderna in 2018 opened a manufacturing site in the shell of a former Polaroid plant in Norwood, near the company’s Cambridge, Mass., headquarters. In the plant, employees wearing white lab gowns, hair nets and safety goggles work amid lab hoods, robotic machinery and steel tanks to produce drugs and vaccines for clinical trials. Meeting rooms are named after famous scientists such as Curie and Pasteur. To make the coronavirus vaccine, Moderna repurposed some of the robotic equipment that was making cancer vaccines tailored to the genetic mutations of patients’ tumors. As many as 100 manufacturing and quality-control employees were involved in the effort, many working nights and weekends. As manufacturing ramped up, the company’s leaders had frequent meetings, calls and WhatsApp messaging chains to monitor progress, and stayed in close contact with NIAID. After Moderna’s effort became public in January, friends and family members became interested. Juan Andres,      Moderna’s head of technical operations, said, “I wasn’t used to my kid thinking I did anything cool,” but his 15-year-old son began asking questions about the project at dinner. Moderna finished manufacturing about 500 vials on Feb. 7, a Friday. Normally, the company would have waited until Monday to start quality-control tests, but about 10 to 15 workers spent the weekend testing samples for potency and other features. The batch cleared most tests that weekend, but it took about two weeks to complete sterility testing. Moderna stored the supply in freezers set to minus-70 degrees Celsius. One risk of moving so fast is that Moderna and NIAID won’t know for sure they picked the best fragment of the virus’s genetic sequence to target until the human study is completed. Get an early-morning briefing about the coronavirus each weekday and a weekly Health newsletter when the crisis abates. “It is possible it’s going to work, but we have to wait and see,” said Mr. Bancel, Moderna’s CEO. The first trial will be conducted at NIAID’s clinical-trials unit in Bethesda. If the first one is successful, a second trial of hundreds or thousands of participants could begin, which could take six to eight months, Dr. Fauci said. This trial could be conducted partly in the U.S. but also in China or a region where the virus is spreading, so the testing could gauge whether the vaccine reduces infection rates. If the second trial is positive, the vaccine could be ready for widespread use, he said. How widely the virus has spread by then will determine whether it is given to targeted groups such as health-care workers, or more broadly to the general population, Dr. Fauci said.

To make their wares more appealing to customers, some companies are executing a counterintuitive twist on that strategy: They are making it easy to quit. ClassPass Inc., which has a monthly subscription service that gives users access to exercise classes at a variety of gyms and studios, is phasing out a live-chat feature that customers have had to contend with when they cancel. The chat was partly designed to encourage customers to find a better plan that they might not have been aware of before signing off for good, according to            Lauren Cowher      Hill, director of global customer experience at ClassPass. But the company is rolling out technology to automate its cancellation process, Ms. Cowher Hill said, with the goal of making it available to all global consumers in the coming months. “We know the ability to pause or make changes to a membership is something our members deeply value,” Ms. Cowher Hill said. “And this isn’t just true for ClassPass. Globally, there is a growing desire for a frictionless cancellation flow, especially for subscription services, and we’re proud to be making strides to deliver that.”  ClassPass is using what it learned from the live chat process to inform its automated cancellation system, she said. Many companies have used onerous policies and processes to keep customers past trial periods and discourage them from canceling later, according to Robbie Kellman Baxter, a consultant specializing in membership models and subscription pricing and author of a forthcoming book, “The Forever Transaction: How to Build a Subscription Model So Compelling, Your Customers Will Never Want to Leave.” But that isn’t a winning long-term strategy, she said. “If you’re trying to have a long-term relationship with your customer and you’re kind of sneaky with the terms, you’re not going to be generating trust,” Ms. Baxter said. Some companies have also been called out for difficult cancellation rules. The Honest Co., a consumer-goods company co-founded by actress            Jessica Alba,      was criticized in 2016 for making subscribers call on the phone before they could cancel. It changed its policy that December to allow cancellation online. Last year, Rent the Runway began letting subscribers to its fashion service immediately pause or cancel memberships by sending a single email. It previously required members to call or email a “Membership Concierge,” which had drawn complaints for sometimes replying slowly. The company made the change to make things easier for members, but a representative noted another benefit as well: It lightened inbound calls to the customer service team. Easy cancellation policies could actually help businesses lure in more subscribers and encourage more customers to come back if they have left, said Peter Fader, a professor of marketing at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. Such policies, he says, make the subscription experience more personal by making customers feel fairly treated. That could help the subscription companies’ broader efforts to make recurring shipments and automatic charges feel less transactional and more like membership in a club. Harry’s Inc., the subscription razor service that also sells products in retail stores, last May launched what it describes as a “core membership” program that costs $15 a year, giving customers discounts when they shop online as well as free engravings and access to limited-edition products. It started the program because customer feedback indicated a desire for specialized services, according to            Kalpana Ganti,      head of digital product at Harry’s. The company has converted 57% of subscribers to its basic monthly plan to the new membership program, Ms. Ganti said. Harry’s said customers can cancel either through Harrys.com—by clicking a button on their profile—or by getting in touch with the customer support team via phone or email. Personalized services and other membership touches help companies connect with customers who are increasingly subscribing instead of making individual purchases, said            Tien Tzuo,      founder and CEO of Zuora Inc., a provider of software for subscription companies. Companies that offer membership services are trying to project a broader lifestyle that will appeal to customers and add value beyond the product itself, Mr. Tzuo said. Brightly marked, easy exits could become an essential feature of membership models, according to            Greg Alvo,      founder and CEO of the subscription software company OrderGroove Inc. His company’s clients include        GNC Holdings Inc.,      which upgraded its interface last May to make it easier for customers to modify or cancel their subscriptions. Making quitting simple could even become the law. A 2018 California regulation began requiring companies that let consumers subscribe online to also let them opt out online. “We think this is a precursor to more consumer protections to come,” said            Guy Marion,      chief executive officer and co-founder at Brightback Inc., which offers automated customer retention software for subscription companies. “Subscription businesses are in the midst of exploring how to best transition their cancel experiences online, reflecting both the shifting consumer expectation and new regulatory requirements,” Mr. Marion said. —Mr. Kassel is a writer in New York.

They say that the four most dangerous words in investing are “this time is different.” Taking that sage advice too literally with the coronavirus crisis looks like a mistake, though. Epidemics are of course older than humanity and economic scares as old as markets, but the confluence of a potential pandemic with today’s complicated and interconnected world is unique. Globalization has magnified local disruptions, government stimulus is already at once-unthinkable levels and, both ominously and hopefully, technology is far more advanced than during the last truly global pandemic. The SARS epidemic, while deadlier for those who caught it, provides a faulty template for understanding the Covid-19 outbreak because it was contained fairly quickly. The 1918 “Spanish flu” pandemic, with a lower fatality rate but global, occurred in a world before jet travel, widespread stock ownership or complex supply chains. Yet many on Wall Street are still adhering to the SARS analogy, even as evidence mounts that the coronavirus outbreak will last longer and spread much farther. Expectations that it will remain centered in China, and that Chinese economic growth will get just a couple of percentage points knocked off it before a “V-shaped” recovery takes hold in the second quarter, appear extremely optimistic.

Eleven of those 13 passengers are infected by the virus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The NIH-sponsored study is part of public health officials’ race to determine quickly whether the Gilead drug, called remdesivir, is effective in treating Covid-19, the illness caused by the new coronavirus. The study is designed to enroll up to nearly 400 patients globally, who will be randomly selected to receive remdesivir or a placebo. While the illness has led to thousands of fatalities world-wide, most people who become infected experience flu-like symptoms such as fever and cough before recovering on their own, health officials have said. The U.S. remdesivir study is scheduled to be completed in April 2023, but researchers could have preliminary results within a year, said Andre Kalil, a professor of internal medicine at the University of Nebraska who is leading the study for the NIH.

The number of new cases outside Hubei dropped to just nine on Monday, Chinese authorities said, a marked decrease from the peak of nearly 900 new cases that were recorded Feb. 3. But outside China, outbreaks in South Korea, Italy and Iran continued to grow, spooking global financial markets on concerns that diminished economic activity and increased travel restrictions around the world could sharply hurt global growth. Federal health authorities in the U.S. also warned on Tuesday that they now expect a wider spread of the virus and are preparing for a potential pandemic. The sharp increase in numbers in countries outside China showed the power with which a few cases can rapidly multiply, said Eric Feigl-Ding, an epidemiologist and health economist at the Harvard Chan School of Public Health. “Sometimes all you need is one super spreading event and it can get out of hand,” he said.

In the U.S., 14 locally diagnosed cases have been confirmed, with an additional 40 from the outbreak on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Asia and three among Americans who returned from China aboard U.S.-chartered flights. So far, American public-health systems have sought to contain the virus by isolating confirmed cases while monitoring close contacts of these patients for signs of infection. This strategy is most effective when the case count is relatively low and each case can be epidemiologically linked to each other and traced to an original source, health authorities say. That is the current situation with the confirmed U.S. cases.  "

A number of Chinese municipal governments are imposing stricter health screenings on people entering China and, in some cases, even quarantine measures on those arriving from coronavirus-afflicted countries. These controls come after Beijing waged a concerted campaign urging other governments not to impose restrictions on travel to and from China, saying such measures were out of line with World Health Organization guidance. China has reported a slowdown in the domestic spread of the Covid-19 disease, which has killed more than 2,700 people, amid rising numbers of new cases abroad. The trend has prompted local authorities in Beijing and a number of cities across eastern and northeastern China to take steps this week to “strictly prevent the import of overseas epidemics,” in the words of several of the cities.  Municipal leaders in Beijing urged a new level of vigilance against risks from overseas outbreaks, demanding stricter health screenings at immigration checkpoints and targeting preventive measures for foreigners. Among these steps, the capital said Wednesday it would impose 14-day quarantines on foreigners arriving from or with recent travel history in countries and areas severely afflicted with the coronavirus, without specifying which places. “The coronavirus epidemic is spreading overseas, and there’s a high degree of concern in society,” Gao Xiaojun, a spokesman for Beijing’s municipal health commission, said at a news briefing. “Beijing municipality is comprehensively strengthening immigration health controls to strictly guard against risks of the epidemic being imported.” Major cities in eastern Shandong province, as well as the northeastern provinces of Liaoning and Jilin, have also imposed stricter health screenings in recent days for travelers entering China, including some that explicitly target people arriving from South Korea and Japan, where large clusters of Covid-19 cases have emerged. South Korean authorities on Wednesday reported 1,261 confirmed cases—up from just 51 a week ago. The Chinese government hasn’t signaled any plans to limit or block international travel to and from other epidemic-hit countries, such as suspending flights or barring entry—measures that Beijing has urged other governments not to impose against China, citing the WHO’s advice on epidemic controls. Yet dozens of countries have taken steps to dissuade or restrict travel to and from China, including travel advisories, suspensions of direct flights, as well as mandatory quarantines or even outright bans on visitors with Chinese nationality or recent travel histories in China. Some officials and medical experts from these countries have justified their measures by citing the travel curbs that China has imposed domestically, such as the complete or partial lockdowns of entire cities and restrictions on the day-to-day movements of hundreds of millions of people. Over the past month or so, Chinese diplomats have portrayed the epidemic as a test of friendship, calling on foreign governments not to suspend travel links with China or to evacuate their citizens—measures Beijing decries as unnecessary, fear-inducing and unfriendly. Outbreaks in other countries—including nearby South Korea—appear to have prompted a shift in tone from China. On Wednesday, China’s Foreign Ministry said Beijing is “studying the use of preventive control measures that are scientific, appropriate and targeted.” “Recently some countries have taken some necessary measures targeting immigration to strengthen epidemic prevention and control,” ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told reporters when asked about Chinese measures against travelers from South Korea and Japan. “As long as these measures are scientific, professional and appropriate, everyone can understand.” Local Chinese measures announced in recent days generally prescribe health screenings and temperature checks at airports and other immigration checkpoints for people arriving from outside China. In Weihai, a port city in Shandong, officials imposed a 14-day quarantine starting Tuesday for all travelers arriving from South Korea and Japan and ordered efforts to trace people who had recently traveled there. Authorities in nearby Yantai city said they will set up segregated airport passageways for people flying in from affected areas, and they have plans to conduct pathogen testing—free of charge—on all travelers arriving from abroad. Qingdao, another port city in Shandong, introduced stricter controls this week on people arriving from abroad, including a stay-at-home quarantine for those with local residences, as well as a requirement for business and short-stay travelers to stay at designated hotels. In Liaoning and Jilin, which border North Korea, major cities like Shenyang, Dalian and Yanji have imposed health screenings for travelers arriving on international flights. The international airport in Jilin’s Changchun city is setting up segregated passageways for travelers flying to and from South Korea and Japan, while requiring airport staff handling such flights to don protective gear. Already, China quarantined some 257 people who arrived Tuesday on two flights from South Korea’s Incheon airport after some passengers were found to have abnormal body temperatures, according to state broadcaster China Central Television. Among them, 163 passengers were quarantined in Weihai, while the rest were in the central city of Nanjing, CCTV said. South Korean Foreign Minister            Kang Kyung-wha      criticized the quarantines as excessive, saying Seoul has exercised restraint in imposing immigration controls on travelers from China while the coronavirus was spreading there. “There needs to be continued communication with China to ensure that China will also exert restraint and will not make excessive responses,” Ms. Kang told reporters after attending a security conference in Berlin, according to South Korea’s semiofficial Yonhap News Agency. She reiterated her views in a Wednesday phone call with her Chinese counterpart, though the two foreign ministers agreed to continue bilateral cooperation in efforts to contain the epidemic, according to a statement from South Korea’s Foreign Ministry. South Korea, the hardest-hit country apart from China, has reported 1,595 Covid-19 cases as of Thursday morning—up from 82 a week ago—as well as 12 related deaths. Japan, meanwhile, has more than 170 cases. Iran has reported 139 confirmed Covid-19 cases and 19 deaths, the highest death toll outside of China. Italy has reported more than 300 cases. At home, Beijing continued to signal confidence in its fight against the epidemic. China’s National Health Commission said it tallied 52 deaths on Tuesday—the lowest daily figure since Feb. 1—and 406 new cases.

At a Wednesday meeting of the Communist Party’s seven-member Politburo Standing Committee, President            Xi Jinping      said positive trends in China’s epidemic-control efforts were expanding. Mr. Xi urged the party to remain focused on fighting the disease, while leading fellow members of the leadership in making donations to support the fight against Covid-19, according to CCTV. Separately Wednesday, state media said two major state-owned publishers have jointly released a book titled “A Major Power’s Battle Against the Epidemic,” which lionizes Mr. Xi’s leadership over national efforts to combat the coronavirus. Written under the auspices of the party’s propaganda department, the book features material that demonstrates Mr. Xi’s “strategic foresight and outstanding leadership abilities” that he applied in mobilizing the nation to fight a “people’s war” against the epidemic, according to the state-run Xinhua News Agency. The book, which will be translated into five languages including English, French and Spanish, “highlights the significant advantages inherent in the Communist Party’s leadership and the socialist system with Chinese characteristics,” Xinhua said. —Timothy W.

NBC has a multibillion-dollar agreement to broadcast them. Athletes who have been training for years are months away from the pinnacle of their sporting lives. But there is increasing concern that the Summer Games won’t go on at all. As outbreaks of the novel coronavirus spread through Asia and Europe, organizers made it clear on Tuesday that they have begun worrying about the public health implications of holding the Games, where hundreds of thousands of people gather in one place, spend two weeks in close quarters and fly back to some 200 countries. The Tokyo Games are scheduled to begin on July 24, but a senior member of the International Olympic Committee raised the possibility of cancellation or postponement if the outbreak wasn’t contained in the next three months, setting an unofficial deadline around the end of May. The last time the Olympics were canceled was during World War II. “This is the new war and you have to face it,” Dick Pound, an IOC member since 1978, told the Associated Press. “In and around that time, I’d say folks are going to have to ask: ‘Is this under sufficient control that we can be confident about going to Tokyo, or not?’”  "

The most vulnerable occupations include marketing specialists, financial advisers and computer programmers—jobs that tend to pay high wages and skew toward male, white and Asian workers, a recent study from the Brookings Institution found. Other jobs most vulnerable to being affected by AI included certain types of engineers, optometrists, graphic designers, software developers and sales managers.

Thinking she was getting a cold, she walked to a small local clinic to get some treatment and then went back to work. Eight days later, the 57-year-old was barely conscious in a hospital bed, one of the first suspected cases in a coronavirus epidemic that has paralyzed China and gripped the global economy. The virus has spread around the world and sickened more than 100,000. For almost three weeks, doctors struggled to connect the dots between Ms. Wei and other early cases, many of them Hua’nan vendors. Patient after patient reported similar symptoms, but many, like her, visited small, poorly resourced clinics and hospitals. Some patients balked at paying for chest scans; others, including Ms. Wei, refused to be transferred to bigger facilities that were better-equipped to identify infectious diseases. When doctors did finally establish the Hua’nan link in late December, they quarantined Ms. Wei and others like her and raised the alarm to their superiors. But they were prevented by Chinese authorities from alerting their peers, let alone the public. One of the first doctors to alert Chinese authorities was criticized for “spreading rumors” after sharing with a former medical-school classmate a test result showing a patient had a coronavirus. Another doctor had to write a self-criticism letter saying his warnings “had a negative impact.”  "

A machine-learning system then scans and analyzes the text to spot and plot possible outbreaks on an online map. The Covid-19 map builds on HealthMap’s predictive technology. Locations of outbreaks are fed into a data repository maintained by a working group focused on the coronavirus. The group—which consists of teams at the Harvard Medical School, the Oxford Martin School at the University of Oxford, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington and other organizations—continually searches those locations for confirmed infections from trusted news sources, government reports, the World Health Organization and local and national health authorities.

Epidemics of infectious diseases have become a regular part of the global landscape in the past quarter-century, thanks in part to economic trends including urbanization, globalization and increased human consumption of animal proteins as society becomes more prosperous, these experts say. The public needs to prepare for more of them, they add. An old rule of thumb in pandemic research was that such events happened about three times every century, said David Finnoff, an economist at the University of Wyoming College of Business. So far this century, the world has already confronted an array of viral scares, including SARS in 2002 and 2003, the swine flu (also known as H1N1) in 2009, MERS in 2012, Ebola in 2014 to 2016, Zika in 2015 and Dengue fever in 2016. The incidence of infectious disease events has more than doubled from the 1940s to 1960s, according to EcoHealth Alliance, a New York-based nonprofit research group that built a database tracking disease events globally. The rate of such incidents surged in the 1980s with the advent of HIV and is now rising, says Peter Daszak, the group’s president.  "

The Wuhan Institute of Virology contributed to China’s fast identification earlier this year of the outbreak’s source as a novel, or previously unknown, coronavirus. It was a monumental achievement for a government that aims to rival the West in high-technology, including bioscience. Yet, the institute’s location at ground zero of the most infectious epidemic in China’s modern history has also made it a target for peddlers of alternate theories that humans first contracted the virus as the result of an accident of some kind at the laboratory. Leading scientists in China and internationally have dismissed such views, saying that the virus likely originated in wildlife, perhaps bats, before spreading to humans, possibly through a food market in Wuhan. But biosafety experts agree that as more countries handle deadly and exotic microbes at containment labs like the one in Wuhan, risks of accidents or terrorism are growing. In a rush to open labs that scientists say can appear motivated by national pride, governments on every major continent now handle dangerous pathogens that were once confined to a handful of institutions like the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “The release of pathogenic microorganisms from high-containment laboratories, such as the pandemic CoV-19, seems more likely in countries without current, historically solidified standards or legislation,” says Thomas Binz, who leads biosafety efforts at Switzerland’s Federal Office of Public Health.

So far, the epidemic has disrupted supply chains and sent stocks falling, but its greater economic impact remains unknown. The Association of Public Health Laboratories estimates testing of people potentially infected with Covid-19, the respiratory illness caused by the virus, will cost $25 million for the first two months of the public response. Vaccines, sick leave, travel changes all come at a cost, but who is shouldering the bill? The answer is federal agencies, insurance companies, local health departments—and patients. For those who are sick and thinking of getting tested, one question quickly emerges: How much will I be billed? For now, most people with health insurance will likely have the cost of coronavirus testing covered in the way that any other type of care is covered—including whatever they may owe in co-pays, co-insurance or under a deductible.

Doctor groups, hospitals and health insurers are increasingly steering people with mild or no symptoms toward initial visits conducted by phone, interactive video or secure messaging. They are also starting to use the technology to care remotely for people with suspected or confirmed cases of Covid-19, the respiratory disease caused by the virus. The number of coronavirus cases in the U.S. crossed 100 Tuesday, with a growing outbreak in Washington and new cases scattered across states from New York to Arizona. As the fast-moving virus spreads, hospitals and doctors say they fear a surge of patients into waiting rooms could further spread the disease. If a patient is potentially infected, “we don’t want them coming into a doctor’s office or urgent care or emergency room to sit in a waiting room and potentially infect other patients,” said Robert Wyllie, chief of medical operations at the Cleveland Clinic. The Cleveland Clinic is suggesting that patients call,  setting up a video visit with a doctor who can decide whether the patient needs to come in for an examination. Hospitals are also seeking to conserve beds for the sickest patients, should a large outbreak occur. Critically ill coronavirus cases could stress the capacity of hospitals, infectious-disease experts say. In the Seattle area, where a nursing home is at the epicenter of new cases, officials announced plans to buy a hotel to house Covid-19 patients as they recover. “We want to do everything we can so that only people with severe illness are going to the hospital,” said Jenna Mandel-Ricci, who is heading emergency preparations for the Greater New York Hospital Association, a trade group. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has urged doctors and hospitals to first assess potentially infected patients remotely. The agency is also suggesting that patients with mild symptoms from Covid-19 can be cared for at home when possible, but monitored closely using virtual check-ins. Companies that provide telehealth services say they have seen an uptick in recent days. “The evidence of community spread, that was a big game-changer,” said Ian Tong, chief medical officer of Doctor on Demand Inc., a telemedicine company. “People are on high alert.” American Well Corp., which offers doctor visits primarily by video, had seen an 11% higher-than-expected volume leading into Monday, and expects further growth, said Peter Antall, chief medical officer. Part of the increase is from people worried about Covid-19, but the surge was also driven by patients with other conditions seeking to avoid being exposed. American Well has had two patients who met CDC guidelines for testing, and it referred them to hospitals, Dr. Antall said Monday. The company reaches out to let the hospitals know of patients’ arrival, and tells patients to remain in their cars until hospital personnel meet them, he said. It also makes sure local public-health officials are contacted and follows up to make sure the patients got treated. “It would be irresponsible for us to just send patients off and say, ‘go to your local emergency room,’” Dr. Antall said. Providence—which operates eight hospitals in the Seattle area—plans to start steering patients initially using a chatbot, a computer program designed to take questions and provide answers. The system, which operates 51 hospitals and 1,000 clinics across seven states, consulted CDC guidelines and its own doctors about criteria by which patients should be triaged to nurses, said Todd Czartoski, telehealth chief executive for Providence. “We literally spent 48 hours going back and forth about where do you draw the line?” he said. The chatbot, built in-house two years ago, will be found online on a Providence webpage for Covid-19 information. Anyone with clear exposure—such as contact with someone potentially infected or having made recent travel in areas with outbreaks—will be directed to call Providence nurses, Dr. Czartoski said. The chatbot will also steer those with flulike symptoms and trouble breathing to nurses, as well as those with mild symptoms who are at higher risk, such as seniors or those with heart disease. Kaiser Permanente, the big integrated health-care provider and insurer based in California, says it is using telehealth to care for members who are quarantining at home. Patients are staying in touch with doctors via video, phone and text-style messaging, said Patrick Courneya, Kaiser Permanente’s chief medical officer. “The ability to stay connected with people remotely and follow them over time is very powerful,” said Dr. Courneya. Kaiser is also issuing laptops to more doctors, who can do visits from home during late hours or should they be isolated due to potential infection, he said. Intermountain Healthcare, a large Utah hospital system, is using video visits for a coronavirus-infected patient who is in one of its hospitals. The patient, who was a passenger on the cruise ship Diamond Princess, is in an isolated room where nurses care for him in person, but doctors see him via a live video feed, said Todd Vento, medical director for Intermountain’s infectious-disease telehealth program. “You can get a really good assessment through the camera,” said Dr. Vento, who said the technology allows him to zoom in if needed. The patient currently has no symptoms of Covid-19, he said. Telehealth services have grown rapidly in recent years. A 2019 Kaiser Family Foundation survey found 82% of big employers included such a service in their biggest health plan, up from 27% in 2015. But the services haven’t always proved popular. A Kaiser foundation analysis of 2016 data found uptake by consumers was low. Telehealth providers are lobbying for Congress to include in coronavirus-related legislation a provision to allow for Medicare to loosen tight limits on paying for remote visits during an emergency.

In natural disasters such as hurricanes, hospitals and medical facilities can be reimbursed under a federal program that pays them about 110% of Medicare rates for treating patients such as those evacuated from hard-hit areas. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has been in discussions about using that program to pay providers who treat uninsured patients with coronavirus, the person said. Dr. Robert Kadlec, who is the assistant secretary for preparedness and response at the Department of Health and Human Services, said Tuesday at a congressional hearing that discussions are being held about using the National Disaster Medical System reimbursement program. In 2018, 8.5% of people, or 27.5 million, didn’t have insurance at any point during the year. It was an increase from 2017, when 7.9% of the population, or 25.6 million, were uninsured, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.  "

Wouldn’t it make sense to be more proactive and consider, perhaps on a national level, how payment procedures at checkout locations can be simplified and made safer for the end-user? The technology for contactless payment exists and has been implemented in certain settings (typically in mass-transit systems). This may be the time to seriously rethink checkout procedures and other daily routines that we don’t usually pay much attention to before we see more cases of coronavirus in this country. I believe that the rapid implementation of contactless credit-card devices and the mandatory provision of hand sanitizer would be cost-effective and help to prevent the spread of many viral infections, not just this latest coronavirus. Smartphone apps could eliminate contagion from all kinds of transactions that involve touching shared, public objects like ATMs, library catalogue screens, point-of-sale devices and immigration terminals.

She was nursing a sore throat and a fever, local health officials report, and any doctor would have advised her to stay home—especially as the new coronavirus lurked in South Korea. But skipping Sunday service wasn’t an option: Church leaders take attendance by checking a follower’s Shincheonji-issued photo ID, said current and former church members. Pushing through the glass door, she would have walked by a first-floor museum dedicated to the group’s founder, Lee Man-hee, who members believe immortal. She descended into a basement worship hall with no windows or furniture. She spent roughly two hours there, health officials determined, crammed shoulder-to-shoulder sitting on her knees on the floor with about 1,000 others. Hewing to the church’s strict routine, she would have embraced others repeatedly, wailing “amen!” The spiritual moment was a perfect incubator for disease, as was the church. On Feb. 17, health officials diagnosed the 61-year-old as South Korea’s 31st coronavirus patient, later declaring her Patient Zero for the wave of Shincheonji-linked cases. She had also attended services the Sunday before. Health officials trace about three-fifths of the country’s 3,736 cases to her as of March 1.  "

They are forging emails mentioning the outbreak that appear to be from business partners or public institutions in an effort to get users to open the messages, unleashing malware. The number of malicious emails mentioning the coronavirus has increased significantly since the end of January, according to cybersecurity firm            Proofpoint Inc.,      which is monitoring the activity. The company recently assigned an analyst to track coronavirus threats, something it hasn’t done for prior hacking campaigns related to disasters or major public events, said            Sherrod DeGrippo,      Proofpoint’s senior director of threat research and detection. Proofpoint analysts now see multiple email campaigns mentioning the coronavirus every workday. “We don’t typically see events like that. Natural disasters are very localized; events like the Olympics come and go and I think something like the Olympics doesn’t get the clicks that a health scare would,” she said. The dearth of information about the epidemic, along with plenty of conflicting claims, provides an opening for criminals, said            Ryan McConnell,      founder of R. McConnell Group PLLC, a law firm in Houston.  Email doctored to look like a company’s purchase order for face masks or other supplies could trick an employee into wiring payments to a fraudulent account, he said. Individuals could provide personal details in response to a phishing attempt that promises information about a company’s remote-work plan, he said. “With the coronavirus, it’s a heightened risk because it’s a good vehicle for fraud and people are scared,” he said. Russia-based cybersecurity company Kaspersky Lab said it had detected 403 users of its security products who were hit with about 500 coronavirus-related files. The company hasn’t determined how the malware was planted onto the devices, said            Anton V. Ivanov,      a malware analyst. Japanese residents were among the first to be targeted in January and February, with emails purporting to be from regional health-care facilities. The messages contained legitimate contact information for key personnel, according to screenshots of emails and translations provided by the cybersecurity arm of            International Business Machines Corp.      , which has been tracking the scams. “It was very focused on enterprise users, and came in a message that would look like it’s a reply to something, or a warning that people are getting from the government. It could have been pretty effective at infecting company users,” said            Limor Kessem,      an executive security adviser at IBM Security who published findings on the campaign. Attackers have sent emails containing about a dozen types of malware, according to Proofpoint’s analysis. Attacks mentioning the coronavirus are much more creative and sophisticated than typical spam, Ms. DeGrippo said. One email that was sent to companies in the transportation sector purported to be from a World Health Organization employee. It included a WHO logo and instructions about how to monitor crews aboard ships for coronavirus symptoms, and included an attachment with instructions, according to a screenshot provided by Proofpoint. The WHO, a United Nations agency based in Geneva, published a warning about coronavirus email scams on its website and asked victims to report emails. The agency has received almost daily reports about phishing attempts mentioning the coronavirus, a spokeswoman said in an email. She declined to provide a tally. “It’s social engineering at scale, based on a fear. That’s the way to be effective,” Ms. DeGrippo said. Phishing can be an effective tactic for public health crises, said IBM’s Ms. Kessem, as most major companies and municipal authorities rely heavily on email to communicate policies regarding the outbreak and their plans for handling people who may have been exposed. Bart McDonough,      chief executive of cybersecurity firm Agio LLC, which provides services to hedge funds, investment banks and other financial-services firms, said he has seen emails sent to clients that impersonate municipal health authorities giving businesses information on the virus. “The Center for Disease Control and World Health Organization fakes, candidly, haven’t been very sophisticated. I think they will improve their level of sophistication as this starts to hit wealthier nations,” he said.

Seeming to come from nowhere in the waning days of World War I, it spread through a war-ravaged world like wildfire. In a matter of months, a third of the world’s population was infected, 50 to 100 million people died, and the global economy shrank by 5%. The world of 1918 was very different from today’s, where the new coronavirus is emerging as another potential pandemic. A century ago, antibiotics, modern hospitals, intensive care units and instant communication did not exist; most people lived in rural communities; intercontinental travel took weeks rather than hours. Now the world’s population is four times larger, with more than half living in urban areas. National economies are heavily intertwined because of globalization. Health services are highly sophisticated in wealthy countries, though their quality varies greatly in the rest of the world. From a public health perspective, however, there are important similarities between the 1918 flu and the 2019 coronavirus. Both were previously unknown viral strains for which there was no existing vaccine or proven medical treatment. Both spread through respiratory droplets and killed primarily by means of pneumonia and other complications. Both caused severe economic disruptions. With the growing risk of a full-blown pandemic, applying the lessons of the 1918 flu could save countless lives in 2020. Provide effective leadership. In 1918, Philadelphia was one of the hardest-hit American cities, partly because it was, as the muckraker Lincoln Steffens put it, “the worst-governed city in America.” In his book “The Great Influenza,” the historian John M. Barry describes the efforts of Dr. Wilmer Krusen, director of Philadelphia’s Public Health and Charities department, a well-intentioned man who lacked public health experience and was prone to inaction. On Sep. 28, 1918, he allowed the city to proceed with a Liberty Loan parade to sell millions of dollars in war bonds, despite warnings that the event would spread illness. The parade drew 200,000 people; within 72 hours, every bed in the city’s 31 hospitals was filled. By contrast, Mr. Barry shows, St. Louis had the most success of any large American city in fighting the pandemic. Dr. Max Starkloff, the city’s health commissioner, said that his goal was to “keep the epidemic out of the city, if possible, and if that fails, to use every means to keep it down to the lowest possible number of cases.” He created an advisory body that included representatives of the city’s chamber of commerce, schools, medical society, university, Red Cross and local public health services. He pursued what he called “intelligent citizen cooperation” through active outreach to the community. And he engaged health department staff, policy makers and teachers to implement individual quarantines and bans on public gatherings. Thanks to Starkloff’s rapid, inclusive and systematic efforts, St. Louis’s mortality rate from the flu was half of Philadelphia’s.  "

But that may be up to the courts to decide. Corporations already have had claims rejected for payments under a popular type of coverage called business-interruption insurance, according to industry brokers and lawyers. In the rejections, insurers cited various terms and conditions, signaling that companies’ battle for recoveries will be slugged out almost policy by policy based on contractual language. “There is no guesswork here: There will be insurance-coverage disputes,” said Kirk Pasich, an insurance-recovery attorney in Los Angeles. Mr. Pasich represents several clients from the retail, construction and entertainment industries who are gearing up for legal action after their business-interruption claims were rejected. They filed those claims related to projects in China or Italy that got caught in quarantines or other government action that revoked their ability to operate, costing clients up to tens of millions of dollars, he said. “There is so much money at stake and strong differences of opinions as to whether insurance applies,” he said.

She was on the verge of a breakdown. She’d been working nonstop for days at the center of China’s coronavirus outbreak, where she is a doctor. Both of her parents had Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, as did many of her colleagues. The number of sick and dying was climbing. And on this day, Dr. Zhang had forgotten about her 9-year-old daughter, who was home alone and scared—and who, at that moment, wasn’t picking up the phone. Dr. Zhang’s eyes welled up, but she had no energy to cry. “My tears wouldn’t flow,” she said in an interview on Feb. 18. Around the world, doctors are being stretched to the limit. Short on supplies and sleep, they’re being asked to stop a global pandemic that no one fully understands. Adding to that strain, they’re risking their own health while they diagnose cases and attend to sick patients—along with the health of their spouses, children and other close family members. With the virus now growing more quickly outside China than inside, it’s a problem other countries will increasingly face. In China, more than 3,000 doctors have been infected, according to official data, and at least 22 have died. Some medical professionals believe the numbers are even higher, adding uncertainty for doctors elsewhere confronting the virus. Untold numbers of family members have fallen ill. Chinese doctors are working shifts of 10 hours or more. Many stay in the same hazmat suits the entire time, without food, water or bathroom breaks. Disrobing to eat or go to the bathroom could risk exposure. Medical workers are requesting psychological help to try to deal with the stress. Infectious-disease doctors around the world are trained to handle highly contagious illnesses, and know the risks. But the current outbreak is spreading so quickly that it’s forcing hospitals to deploy staff with limited experience in infectious diseases and, sometimes, insufficient gear to keep them safe. Some hospitals can’t find enough staff willing to take on the risk. In South Korea, some nurses and support staff quit when the outbreak spread, their families begging them to resign. Iran has faced equipment shortages while its deputy health minister—himself a surgeon—has been infected with the virus. Doctors in China say conditions have improved significantly since the early days of the outbreak. Roughly 42,000 medical staff from around the country have descended upon Wuhan and the surrounding Hubei province to provide relief. That includes around 4,000 military doctors in one of China’s largest-ever mobilizations of military medical resources. Wuhan has 53,000 beds in hospitals and temporary medical and quarantine facilities for treating patients with the coronavirus, with a goal of adding 17,000 more, according to an official media briefing on Feb. 20. Crowds and lines at fever wards have subsided as the rate of infections has slowed. Yet around 100 new cases are still emerging in Hubei province every day. An exhibit hall-turned-hospital that Zhongnan Hospital oversees had just one CT scanning machine during a recent tour by officials, according to state media. Liu Fan,      a 59-year-old nurse at Wuhan Wuchang Hospital, one of the main coronavirus crisis centers in Wuhan, died from the virus even though she wasn’t working in a fever ward, according to a Weibo post by the hospital. Her parents died from the virus a few days before her, and her brother, a local film director, died the same day she did, according to Chinese media. In the early days of the outbreak, Wuchang Hospital’s 51-year-old director, a neurosurgeon named            Liu Zhiming,      had warned colleagues about working too hard and burning out. He worried their immunities would decline. On Jan. 24, a chest scan showed he had a serious infection himself; he later tested positive for the virus. As Dr. Liu lay in intensive care, he kept fielding calls and asking about patients, while colleagues grew more anxious. “I’m worried I can’t do anything,” Dr. Liu texted them, according to an account in official Chinese media. In another message, he said that “if it were any other illness, I would persevere and fight with everyone while sick.” His wife,            Cai Liping,      a head nurse at another hospital, implored Dr. Liu to let her visit, but he kept saying no, according to official Chinese media. She asked him to call her every day at 2 p.m. to reassure her he was OK. She reminded him to breathe oxygen and not be afraid. On Feb. 18, Dr. Liu died. A colleague sobbed while telling the media: “We really wanted to give him a farewell, but we had so much work to do.” Many of the heaviest burdens are falling on younger doctors and nurses, who are seen as better suited for high-risk situations, because of their stronger immune systems. One doctor,            Peng Yinhua,      died at just 29 years old, according to state media. He was working in a respiratory and critical care unit, and had postponed his wedding celebration to stay on the job.            Li Wenliang,      the Chinese ophthalmologist turned folk hero who died after warning about the dangers of the virus, was in his early 30s. Both doctors’ wives were pregnant. Dr. Zhang, who worried about her 9-year-old daughter and sick parents, was more prepared for the crisis than most. A radiologist at Zhongnan Hospital, a 3,300-bed facility overlooking a lake in central Wuhan, she had served on the front lines of SARS in 2003, as well as after China’s deadly Sichuan earthquake in 2008. On Dec. 31, Dr. Zhang was on her first day of vacation and planning to take a trip with her parents and daughter to their hometown in Inner Mongolia. That morning, her superiors called, ordering her to attend an emergency meeting. Two patients at Zhongnan had lung infections reminiscent of SARS. Word was spreading among staff that a mysterious illness was sweeping through a seafood market on the west side of town. At the meeting, hospital officials issued new guidelines for staff to disinfect their spaces, unlock windows to ensure circulation of fresh air, and begin wearing goggles and other protection in some areas. Dr. Zhang’s colleagues had asked her to consult on the two patients’ X-rays, and she was worried about what she saw. She warned colleagues that if a virus had spread from animals to humans, then human-to-human transmission would be easy. She also spoke to the hospital’s Communist Party secretary to explain her fear of another epidemic. Some people thought she was being alarmist, she says. With the hospital short on supplies, Dr. Zhang made homemade masks out of gauze for her parents and daughter, just like she’d learned to do during SARS. The family canceled their holiday. A few days later, a technician in the imaging department discovered he had been infected. Sick patients began pouring in. Soon dozens of staff were sick at Zhongnan, and other Wuhan hospitals, as well. Most days, Dr. Zhang reviewed chest X-rays, a relatively low-risk job. Some days, she’d don a hazmat suit and tend to patients herself. Worried she might bring the virus back home, and overloaded with work, she began sleeping on an office sofa. She barely had time to eat and shower. She figured her parents, who lived in her home, could take care of her daughter. Her husband was living and working hundreds of miles away and unable to join them after authorities announced a strict quarantine of Wuhan in late January. Then Dr. Zhang’s 69-year-old mother admitted to feeling sick. Dr. Zhang convinced her parents to get tested for the virus. For her mother’s first visit to the hospital, Dr. Zhang had her meet nearby, so her mother could put on protective gear before going in. Both parents came up negative using the nucleic acid test, a finicky diagnostic tool test that regularly produced false negatives. Their CT scans told a different story. “When I saw it, I knew,” Dr. Zhang said, recalling her mother’s first chest scan. “My heart sank.” Her father, who had been reluctant to get tested, had a lung infection that turned out to be even worse, though he showed no obvious symptoms at the time. All along, the family worried about the youngest member, Dr. Zhang’s daughter. Dr. Zhang had been too scared to check her daughter, until the girl volunteered. “Scan me! It’ll be OK,” she said. Her lungs were normal. Still, Dr. Zhang was facing a crisis. Her husband was away, her parents were sick and contagious, and she was needed at the hospital. There was no one to take care of her daughter, whose school was closed. Dr. Zhang planted her in the family’s living room with instructions to look after herself—and to stay away from her grandparents, who quarantined themselves in other rooms. The 9-year-old learned how to heat up canned congee, placing it at each grandparent’s door. As her parents’ conditions worsened, Dr. Zhang struggled to get them admitted to a hospital. Beds were limited and authorities were unwilling to make arrangements for people whose nucleic acid tests had come back negative. With help from a colleague, Dr. Zhang got hold of some medicine, including antiretroviral medication for HIV that researchers are testing as a treatment for the coronavirus. Her parents suffered side effects, including nausea. Then, 10 quarantine spots opened up for family of Zhongnan Hospital staff, in an empty building slated for demolition. Dr. Zhang raced to grab a number to reserve a spot, while a colleague ran to guard two beds inside. The new location wasn’t designed to provide any medical treatment, but getting a room for her parents was a relief for Dr. Zhang. Although authorities had publicly announced there were no more beds there, scores of people had gathered there anyway, desperate to get space. “Some people were clutching their stomach, others holding their heads and others coughing uncontrollably,” said Dr. Zhang. Her heart broke. After the chaos that day, she suddenly remembered her daughter back home. She tried calling and pulled over her car. She was overwhelmed with feelings of guilt and hopelessness. It took a moment for her to calm herself down. She told herself: “It would be a disaster for the family if I couldn’t pull it together.” Arriving home, Dr. Zhang pushed open the door to find the lights out. In a panic, she called out for her daughter. A faint voice replied from the dark as her daughter stirred from a nap. She had been hungry without food at home, and had little energy to do anything but lie down and sleep. Her daughter ate the meal her mother had brought, pleading for things to be different. She asked why her mother had to be at work all the time. “I was afraid to be alone at home today,” Dr. Zhang’s daughter told her. Dr. Zhang felt terrible but tried to coax her daughter to understand. “You need to grow up,” she said. “If you don’t grow up, Mom will be even more worried.” What’s the best way to support health-care workers? Join the conversation below. Eventually, her daughter said, “Mom is so strong, I’ll be too,” though she admitted she was still scared. Dr. Zhang tucked her daughter in for the night, letting her watch cartoons from her bed. Dr. Zhang knew then she needed to find some way for her husband to join her in Wuhan. The couple applied for special permission from the government; two days later, he got approval to drive the roughly 14-hour journey into the city. On Feb. 3, Dr. Zhang took to her social messaging account to call for the use of chest X-rays in diagnosing Covid-19, instead of lab tests that were resulting in so many false negatives. She raised the alarm on cross-infection within families, recommending the government make use of hotels and school dormitories to quarantine suspected cases. Speaking up was no small risk for Dr. Zhang, who went back and forth over whether to post the night before. Even Dr. Zhang’s friends were worried about her post, she said. Authorities had detained people for speaking up about the outbreak in its early days. The next day, China’s National Health Commission incorporated the use of chest scans in diagnoses in Hubei province. Days later, authorities reclassified more than 13,000 suspected instances of the virus as confirmed cases. That meant many more patients could have a better chance of access to treatment, including hospital beds and quarantine locations as they opened up. Friends sent screenshots of the good news to Dr. Zhang. She worried about a shortage of CT scanners and called up manufacturers that could produce portable machines. She helped coordinate with staff at other facilities to ensure they had enough equipment and technicians. For Dr. Zhang, the outbreak has felt never-ending. Her hospital oversees three separate coronavirus facilities with 5,400 beds. At its own campus, Zhongnan worked to add 2,000 new beds, up from a few hundred for coronavirus patients previously. With their offices being repurposed for patients, Dr. Zhang and her colleagues moved into a hotel, where they work and sleep. Dr. Zhang believes it will take months for hospitals to work through all the infected patients. Letting down their guard could lead to a resurgence in cases. One night, Dr. Zhang returned to her hotel carrying half a dozen lunch boxes for her colleagues. She says her back felt like it would split in two, and she had developed a persistent cough. A hotel security guard checked Dr. Zhang’s temperature and asked her to log what time she entered the building.

Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn said in a statement Sunday that the FDA was alerted to possible issues with the test by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. FDA officials worked with the CDC to “determine that problems with certain test components were due to a manufacturing issue,” Dr. Hahn said. Dr. Hahn didn’t provide further details on the problem, which he said was resolved. He said the FDA “has confidence in the design and current manufacturing of the test,” which has passed quality-control procedures. He said the updated version of the tests are being distributed and “will provide the high-level of diagnostic accuracy we need during this coronavirus outbreak.” The rollout of the CDC’s diagnostic test for the novel coronavirus stalled in February when some state and local public health labs got inconclusive results during the verification process. Some public health experts say the problem slowed the process of detecting the virus and possibly containing its spread. Axios reported earlier Sunday that an FDA official raised concerns about possible contamination of the earlier version of the testing kit after visiting an Atlanta lab that manufactured the product.

Minako Ohashi, a family doctor for more than two decades, said the shift at her Tokyo clinic was unmistakable. “It was business as usual toward the end of the year,” she said. Then, as publicity spread in mid-January about the viral outbreak in the Chinese city of Wuhan and cases started emerging in Japan, the number of flu patients suddenly declined. “I believe the coronavirus affected it in a good way, because people have become more careful about washing hands and wearing masks,” said Dr. Ohashi.

This would be in addition to continuing to provide ample funding for medical research, testing, prevention and treatment. The stimulus’s total cost would be about $350 billion, but could be larger or smaller depending on how the economic situation unfolds. Congress should design it to be accelerated, big, comprehensive and dynamic. • Accelerated. In normal times it takes a year or more for monetary policy to have its maximum economic impact. The Federal Reserve made a bold and correct move with its 50-basis-point rate cut, but no one knows how well or quickly it will work. Most likely, the lower interest rates and depreciated dollar will provide only modest relief after a substantial lag. Fiscal policy can act much more quickly by getting money into people’s hands within weeks or months. • Big. The economy faces an unusual degree of uncertainty around several factors: the fatality and transmission rates of the virus, the timing of a vaccine, the direct and indirect economic effects of the epidemic, and the difficulty of making economic policy in a low-interest-rate environment experiencing an unusual shock to both supply and demand. Amid uncertainty, policy makers must weigh the risks of overreacting against the risks of underreacting. The likelihood that history judges the economic response to coronavirus as too little and too late is much higher than the converse. If the economic shock is small and stimulus proves to be unnecessary, its negative effects are likely to be small. But if the shock is bigger and policy makers fail to act now, it will be harder to reverse the economic damage. With the federal government able to borrow at a negative real interest rate, doing too much is a minimal risk.  "

That is a lot of people, including millions of Americans. Data from China, where the epidemic began, show death rates that are startlingly higher than the average for people age 60 and over, as well as for people with high blood pressure, diabetes, asthma and other chronic conditions. In one large study by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 14.8% of people 80 and older and 8% of people 70 to 79 died. For people with cardiovascular disease, the mortality rate was 10.5%, and 7.3% for those with diabetes. Those rates compared with a 2.3% mortality rate in the overall population of 44,672 patients studied through Feb. 11, China’s CDC says.

The number of Americans 65 and over rose 27% between 2011 and 2018 to 52.4 million, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, while the under-65 cohort grew 2%. Older Americans make up 16% of the U.S. population. About 46% of American adults have high blood pressure, according to guidelines by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association. About 34.2 million people, or 10.5% of the U.S. population, have diabetes, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. China’s statistics are from the early weeks of an explosive epidemic in which hospitals were overwhelmed and doctors struggled to figure out how best to care for patients struck with a new disease. Death rates in less-hard-hit parts of China have been lower, and have come down for the whole country over time, according to the World Health Organization. Precise death rates are also unclear because it isn’t known how many people have actually been infected. Many have either not been ill enough to suspect they had the disease, or haven’t had access to a test. Still, the data show that people with aging or taxed immune systems have a far more difficult time fighting off Covid-19, the respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus. “It’s very clear that this virus has greater mortality and morbidity in older individuals and those with chronic conditions,” says Mark Mulligan, director of NYU Langone Health’s division of infectious diseases and immunology in New York. Morbidity is the rate of a disease’s presence in a population. Older people are generally at higher risk of becoming severely ill from infectious diseases, such as the flu, Dr. Mulligan notes. As people age, the immune system undergoes “immunosenescence,” gradually losing its ability to mount a response to an infection as robustly as it once did. Precisely how that happens is an active subject of study. Among the changes, the thymus, an organ of the immune system, shrinks starting at young adulthood. T-cells, soldiers of the immune system which mature in the thymus, lose some of their function.

Thus, says Dr. Dong, “100.5 may be a true fever” possibly indicating the presence of Covid-19. Lung function also declines with age, making respiratory diseases a particularly serious threat for older people, he says. Older people are more likely to have serious underlying conditions that also put them—and younger people—at risk of complications from Covid-19. Cardiovascular disease, diabetes and lung diseases all tax the body, making infections harder to fight off, says Bruce Ribner, director of Emory University School of Medicine’s Serious Communicable Diseases Unit. “The system is just not able to put up with that much of an assault,” he says. High blood glucose impairs the ability of white blood cells to fight infections in people with diabetes, Dr. Ribner says. Viruses can settle more easily into people whose lungs are impaired from a lung disease, he says. Scientists say they are trying to learn more about the apparent link seen in China between severe Covid-19 and high blood pressure. People with cardiovascular disease often have lung diseases, too, and generally are more susceptible to flu and viral pneumonia, experts say. Covid-19 has already exacted a heavy toll on older, sicker Americans, claiming at least 22 lives in one nursing home in a Seattle-area outbreak that public health officials are struggling to contain. Health officials say Italy’s aging population is a big reason behind the large outbreak and high current death rate of 5% in that country. Death rates for some older people have also been higher than they are for the overall population in a large outbreak in South Korea. Italy and China have higher smoking rates, which may be a factor in their high death rates among older adults, says Marc Lipsitch, professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and director of the Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics. Dr. Lipsitch says he expects mortality rates to be higher for vulnerable people than for the overall population in the U.S., though how much higher is hard to tell. U.S. health officials have urged Americans who are vulnerable to limit travel and avoid large crowds. The risks to such people are “considerable,” says            Anthony Fauci,      director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. “If you are a person with an underlying condition and you are particularly an elderly person with an underlying condition, you need to think twice about getting on a plane on a long trip,” Dr. Fauci said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” this week. “And not only think twice, just don’t get on a cruise ship.” The U.S. government has urged nursing homes to restrict visitor access, to reduce the risk of spread. People at higher risk should heed the same precautions that exist for everyone—wash hands regularly, stay away from sick people and keep up-to-date on vaccines for flu and pneumonia, the U.S. CDC and infectious-disease experts say. They should avoid large gatherings, limit close contact with others when out in public, and stay home as much as possible to reduce risk of exposure, according to the U.S. That likely means no church or theater. “For now, do not congregate in places with a lot of people,” Dr. Dong says. “I would not go to bingo parlors.” But a bridge game with a few trusted friends—who aren’t sick—is OK, he says. It’s important to stay socially connected even if physical connection is limited. Connecting by phone or video with older relatives who are alone is a good idea, he says. Social isolation has been linked to adverse health outcomes, Dr. Dong says. “Being isolated is one of the worst things one can experience.” Ms. McKay is a reporter for The Wall Street Journal in New York.

Caught between trying to keep the virus out of their workplaces and minimizing business disruptions, employers are issuing all sorts of edicts unthinkable just weeks ago, from worker quarantines to officewide remote work and even personal-travel reporting requirements. Many employees, meanwhile, are wondering just how far their bosses have to go to protect them from the outbreak’s spread, and what calls go too far. To better understand what is permissible—and required—in confronting a public-health crisis in the workplace, The Wall Street Journal consulted employment lawyers and other workplace experts. The answers often lie somewhere in the murky balance between the Americans with Disabilities Act, or ADA, which aims to safeguard individuals’ privacy, and Occupational Safety and Health Administration standards, designed to protect workers’ safety. But the body of labor rules and regulations suggest it’s wise to stick to the following guidelines, the experts say. Here are answers to some of the most common questions from employees: Can my employer cancel my vacation time and make me work instead? In most workplaces, yes. Vacation time isn’t guaranteed under federal law, and most employers are within their rights to cancel a vacation and require workers to return to the job, says            Kenneth G. Dau-Schmidt,      a professor of labor and employment law at Indiana University Bloomington. The exception is if an employee is covered by a union contract or specific employment agreement that includes certain time-off protections, he says. Still, most bosses know that pulling a vacation is bound to be an unpopular move, a reason many are loath to do it unless an emergency requires it. “People can get upset if vacations are canceled,” Prof. Dau-Schmidt says. “That would be the major limit on it.” What if my boss tells me to cancel my personal travel plans. Is that legal? Employers can’t dictate how you spend your personal time, even if they do make a recommendation against travel to certain regions, says            Roberta Matuson,      an executive coach and author of “Evergreen Talent: A Guide to Hiring and Cultivating a Sustainable Workforce.” Does the company have to pay for a canceled trip? If a boss insists on an employee cutting a trip, go ahead and ask for reimbursement. Some employers will see that as a reasonable request. But legally, they aren’t required to pay unless an employment contract specifically calls for it, Mr. Dau-Schmidt says. I really feel uncomfortable about commuting into work and increasing my risk of exposure. Do I have the right to work from home? Employers generally don’t have an obligation to allow telecommuting, says            Mitch Boyarsky,      a labor and employment lawyer with Nelson Mullins Riley & Scarborough LLP. An exception is an employee who qualifies under the ADA to work remotely to accommodate a disability. Another might be if the government is ordering a quarantine, other lawyers say. Then an employer could have more of a burden to allow remote work. I feel totally fine and don’t think I’m at risk, but my boss is insisting I work from home. Do I have to? Yes. Employers are within their rights to ask employees to work remotely, as long as they’re not applying a policy in a way that could be deemed discriminatory, says            Angela B. Cornell,      a clinical professor at Cornell Law School and director of the school’s Labor Law Clinic. For example, it’s OK to ask workers who have recently traveled to China, Italy, Iran or another country especially hard hit by the outbreak to work from home for a given period. But it’s not all right to ask workers over the age of 70 to work from home—even if the intentions are well-meaning—because age is a protected class under federal law. My employer has requested that I work from home. Does that mean they can order me not to run errands or go to church? While your boss can ask you not to come into the office, they can’t bar you from going to other places or, say, hopping on the subway. That said, your employer can offer recommendations on how much to venture from home, says Heather Bussing, an employment lawyer in Sonoma County, Calif., with Rybicki & Associates PC. “You can educate and you can encourage, but you can’t control,” she says of employers. My job requires me to have a lot of close contact with many customers. Am I protected if I say I can’t perform my job because of the outbreak? Workers are protected from retaliation from an employer if they refuse to take on what they consider an unsafe work assignment, says            Howard Mavity,      an Atlanta-based partner in the workplace-safety practice of law firm Fisher & Phillips LLP. He advises employers to listen carefully to employee concerns. “You can’t discipline someone for complaining about safety,” he says. It becomes less straightforward, though, if a “reasonable” employee would otherwise deem the assignment safe, Mr. Mavity says. If a hotel housekeeper, for example, has received the necessary training to protect against Covid-19, along with proper gloves and equipment, it may not be considered reasonable to refuse to clean a hotel room. “That wouldn’t really be protected,” he says. If a hotel is known to be housing guests with Covid-19, it’s a different story, and housekeepers might be able to refuse the assignment, he says. Do I have to take that business trip? Minnesota employment lawyer            Kate Bischoff      says your boss can require you to go on a business trip. “There can be the ultimatum that you have to go on this or you can lose your job,” she says. Her advice for workers: Come up with a strong case for how technology could make a virtual meeting effective. For employers, she urges caution. “Making such an ultimatum is going to spread like wildfire through your organization,” she says, prompting lots of workers to rethink their ties to the company. “It is a strategic mistake.” It could also be a legal mistake, depending on the circumstances.            Daniel Schwartz,      a partner with law firm Shipman & Goodwin who mainly represents Connecticut employers, points to a case in Connecticut where the court indicated it could be illegal to require a worker to travel somewhere unsafe. Can my employer take my temperature at work? The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission says that, according to the Americans with Disabilities Act, measuring an employee’s temperature generally is considered a medical examination, and usually beyond the bounds of what an employer can do or require. But in an especially severe or widespread influenza outbreak, such a check is permissible. That rule is likely to apply to a coronavirus epidemic as well. But even if it’s legal to take an employee’s temperature, many lawyers and health experts don’t think it’s useful. “Maybe they have the flu,” Mr. Schwartz says of employees with elevated temperatures. And health officials have said many people with the coronavirus have had no fever. What if I end up catching Covid-19 at work? Is my employer liable? Unlikely—because it’s usually hard to prove. If an employee suffers an injury on the job, such as slipping or falling, then the worker is often entitled to workers’ compensation, which can cover certain medical care and lost wages, says Ms. Cornell. But with the coronavirus, it could be tough to determine exactly where someone contracted the virus, making it difficult to hold an employer responsible for medical costs. Generally, a staffer must prove that the disease was caused by “conditions peculiar to the work” and there were no other opportunities for exposure, according to guidance by Fisher & Phillips to employers. My employer knew a co-worker contracted the virus but didn’t inform the rest of staff right away. Weren’t they required to? Generally, yes. Companies have an obligation to warn those who may have come in contact with someone diagnosed with Covid-19, says Ms. Cornell. Local health authorities may also want the public to know. But it’s highly unlikely a company would identify the employee in question by name. That could violate confidentiality requirements under the ADA, Mr. Mavity says. Instead, employers are more likely to note that a staffer on a certain floor or part of the building contracted the virus. “It will take about a 12th of a second for everyone to know you’re talking about Joe, but you don’t say Joe,” Mr. Mavity says. If I come down with Covid-19, do I have to tell my employer? Can’t I just say I need to take sick time and leave it at that? There may not be a legal requirement, but there is an ethical one, Ms. Matuson says. If you work in an office or interact with colleagues in person, it’s a good idea to alert your company to your diagnosis so managers can tell others. If you work remotely and have had no direct contact with colleagues, clients or other people through your job, though, such a disclosure may not be necessary, Ms. Matuson says. “I would just say, ‘I’m not feeling well,’ ” she says.

In December and early January, when the epidemic first erupted in China’s metropolis of Wuhan and the surrounding Hubei province, official secrecy and the punishment of whistleblowers contributed to the virus’s proliferation. Since then, however, China has adopted draconian measures to control social interactions—a lockdown that seems to have halted the epidemic there, at least for now. China’s National Health Commission Sunday reported only 44 new Covid-19 cases, far fewer than the daily toll in the new hot spots of Italy, South Korea, France—and now the United States. The Communist Party of China, or CPC, is already advertising this achievement as proof of the superiority of its model that prioritizes government control over individual freedoms.  "

Hong Kong’s government closed schools on Feb. 3 as the spread of the coronavirus was accelerating in mainland China, and they have yet to reopen. The semiautonomous city had fewer than 20 confirmed cases in early February, but they were enough to trigger closures of government offices, tourist hot spots and many public facilities. Dow Jones, the parent company of The Wall Street Journal, followed government advisories and closed its Hong Kong, Shanghai and Beijing offices for a month. Employees were told to work from home and avoid congregating. It is an experience many in the U.S. are now facing, to one degree or another: sudden school and office closures, event cancellations, shortages of toilet paper and cleaning supplies, and fears about being exposed to the contagious respiratory virus. Parents are worrying about how they’ll manage child care and remote-work arrangements, and how long all this could last. And we are all learning that we will have to be very adaptable for the foreseeable future. Living under the new restrictions meant spending a lot of time at home—and making it serve as an office and a school, as well as a living space. It wasn’t an ideal fit: a 650-square-foot, two-bedroom flat, a cluttered space shared by two adults, two rambunctious boys and a cat. The children initially cheered upon learning about the school closures, thinking that meant an extended holiday. We all sighed when the American international school my sons attend said that virtual lessons would be conducted over the course of each school day. There would be live teaching via Google Hangouts, assignments that students had to complete in set time frames, and online music, art and physical-education classes. Parents were told to download education and reading apps and were given links to folders with slide presentations, video recordings, online meetings and numerous worksheets. My sons—ages 5 and 7—couldn’t take part in live lessons concurrently from our single family computer, so I went out and bought an iPad and a printer. At the shop, a salesman said he had sold more than a dozen printers that same day “to people just like you, who have kids that will be schooling at home.” Then there was the question of workspace. With no space for study desks in the bedrooms, the children have been using the dining table, couch and coffee tables for virtual school lessons on weekdays. Initially, I thought I could set up my work laptop in a common area in my apartment complex with tables and chairs after cleaning them with disinfecting wipes—but that venue was also closed by the building’s management On the first day of virtual school, I felt my stress level rising as my kids called out for me to help them as I tried to answer emails and messages from work. “Leave them to me,” said my husband, a full-time dad, and I left the apartment to find an alternative venue. I texted a co-worker and asked if I could come to her flat to work. She obliged, though I felt like I was contravening office rules about working remotely and worried that I might unknowingly infect her if I caught the virus on the subway en route to her home. As a stopgap measure, my company rented two small rooms in a hostel and set up screens and workstations for staffers who couldn’t work from home. I spent several days there, before the rooms were abruptly closed when Hong Kong’s health authorities said there was a confirmed coronavirus case in a nearby building. I eventually found another location—the studio apartment of another co-worker who was out of the country. It was a quiet respite from my home, but hunching over a small laptop and working in isolation for days on end, with contact with co-workers limited to emails and phone calls, brought its own difficulties. Many, including myself, struggled with concentration and the lack of face-to-face interactions. We organized several online group meetings so that people could share experiences and stay in touch with each other. I also felt guilty that my spouse was shouldering the burden of getting the children through their schoolwork, so I stayed in some mornings to help. But trying to get a 5-year-old to sit in front of a screen and watch his teacher talk for more than 10 minutes is a challenge in itself. One day, I let him paint a picture while he listened passively to a 45-minute online music lesson (we turned off the iPad camera so that the teacher couldn’t see him). With libraries, gyms, museums, theme parks and most sports facilities closed, in our leisure time we have been going hiking, hanging out at the beach and cycling in the sun. We still eat at our favorite restaurants on weekends. I carry hand sanitizer and wipes everywhere, but have accepted that I can’t keep all our hands clean all the time. (My children have also refused to wear masks, complaining they are uncomfortable.) We’ve had to make other adjustments. When food and cleaning supplies were in short supply in stores last month, I bought a half-liter bottle of hand sanitizer from a neighbor who had stocked up on it during a work trip in Finland. My husband went to the supermarket every few days at its 8 a.m. opening time to buy rice, toilet paper and wipes before panic buyers came and cleared the shelves. During this period, my second-grader had to use “scrounge” in a sentence for phonics class. He wrote: “I have to scrounge for T.P.!” (That turned into a delicate subject. I gave a few rolls of toilet paper to co-workers who were unable to buy them. One gave me Purell wipes that she had bought from            Amazon.com      in return.) Dow Jones partially reopened its Hong Kong and China offices at the beginning of March, bringing back a sense of normalcy for staffers. Employees have to use a sign-up sheet to reserve spots, go through daily temperature checks at the office reception, and wash or sanitize their hands upon arrival. The earliest date Hong Kong schools will reopen is April 20. The city likely has to go through at least 14 days without a new coronavirus infection before the government will let students and teachers congregate again. That has yet to happen; Hong Kong this week reported more than a dozen new infections, raising its total cases to around 130. Friends who lived in Hong Kong during the 2003 SARS epidemic predict that schools won’t reopen until the next academic year begins in August. It is a prospect I dread, but we will probably go on doing what we’re doing. As our new normal has set in, I’ve learned to appreciate the small freedoms we still have and how resilient my children have been. I previously had only a vague idea about what they were learning in school, and now I can see every detail of every lesson. Last week, the boys wrote poems, came up with alliterative sentences, sketched animals, and submitted math worksheets and recordings of themselves reading to their teachers. A few days ago, my 7-year-old figured out how to email me at work during his virtual school day. “hi mom don’t forget to send things!” he wrote in a string of emails, to which I replied with emojis and asked him to focus on his lessons. At 3 p.m., the email chain concluded with his last message: “END OF SCHOOL!!!1!1!!!! YAY!!!!” Ms. Ng is The Wall Street Journal’s Asia finance editor in Hong Kong.

But decades of research tell a sobering truth: People need to learn a thing or two about personal hygiene. Many don’t know proper handwashing technique. They do it for too little time, or they don’t do it at all. Proper handwashing means scrubbing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Yet just 5% of people spent more than 15 seconds washing their hands after using the restroom, and 10% didn’t wash their hands at all, in a study of 3,749 college students published in the Journal of Environmental Health in 2013. How to Wash Your Hands Hands are villages to thousands of germs—including bacteria and viruses. All it takes is a friendly handshake to spread respiratory diseases like Covid-19, the disease caused by the new virus. Respiratory droplets from coughs and sneezes can also spread these germs, as can touching surfaces like doorknobs and phones where those droplets may have landed. “I don’t think we need to panic,” says Elaine Larson, professor emerita of nursing research at the Columbia School of Nursing, who has helped the World Health Organization develop handwashing guidelines. “But we do need to be reminded about basic hygiene.” The virus’s fate is in your hands—literally—so experts say it’s time to start practicing what science is preaching. —Use soap. Before applying soap to your hands, run water over them. Soap and water together, with rubbing, is what helps rinse organisms off your hands and down the drain. Don’t worry about removing hand jewelry, Dr. Larson says. Those need to be washed, too. Soap acts as a surfactant: a substance that helps release bacteria’s grip from your hand when water is added. The study of college students, however, showed only two in three people used soap. The rest just rinsed their hands. Dr. Larson suggests half a teaspoon of liquid soap is enough, or a glob about the size of a quarter, although bigger hands might need more. Health experts say that too much soap can remove your skin’s natural oils, which have helpful antibacterial properties. The CDC says studies haven’t shown that soaps with antibacterial ingredients provide any health benefits or remove more germs than plain soaps. All soaps, however, can deactivate a coronavirus so it can no longer infect you. The new coronavirus, coined SARS-CoV-2, is a spherical structure with spiky proteins attached to a membrane, or envelope, that protects the pathogen’s genetic material. Once it comes into contact with soap, this envelope dissolves, leaving behind a dysfunctional virus. “The envelope is a machine that allows the virus to sneak into human cells,” says Jonathan Abraham, an assistant professor of microbiology at Harvard Medical School. “Without it, the virus cannot infect you.” —Scrub all surfaces of your hands. People on average wash their hands for only about six seconds, according to several studies. Twenty seconds is what’s recommended—or, the length of the “Happy Birthday” song sung twice—though it depends on what you touched and how often. And even 20 seconds “is not helpful if you’re not washing the right places,” Dr. Larson says. “It’s about quality, not quantity.” The most vulnerable parts of your hands are your fingertips, between your fingers, the backs of your hands and under your nails. Rubbing these surfaces with enough force is critical, health experts say. People who have longer nails should be extra cautious, they add. Scrubbing too hard or too frequently can damage your skin by making it dry and more susceptible to cracking, Dr. Larson says. Cuts and cracks give germs the perfect spot to set up shop. To avoid skin damage, Dr. Larson recommends using a moisturizer after washing. Studies have shown that water temperature doesn’t affect how many germs are removed. The CDC says warm or cold water will do, but some experts warn that when water is too hot, it can also damage skin. After a thorough scrub with soap, remove all suds by rubbing every surface of your hands under running, clean water to ensure that pathogens get washed away, Dr. Abraham says. Leaving some soap behind may also soak up moisture from your hands, leaving them dry and more likely to crack. —Dry your hands completely. Now it’s time to dry your hands as thoroughly as you can, because moist hands give living organisms a better chance of surviving and spreading to others, Dr. Abraham says. The CDC says there is not enough data to confirm whether a significant amount of germs are transferred from the faucet knob to your hands. Some experts suggest using a paper towel to turn the water off, while others discourage it because it wastes paper towels. Automatic blowers and paper towels both dry hands well. —Use alcohol-based sanitizers in a pinch. If you’re on the go, alcohol-based sanitizers are great alternatives to soap and water. They cannot kill all viruses, like the norovirus, which lacks a dissolvable envelope. But a sanitizer can kill any coronavirus on your hands as long as it’s made up of at least 60% alcohol, health experts say. Plain rubbing alcohol also works, but sanitizers maintain a balance of alcohol and other ingredients to help keep skin healthy and moisturized. It’s important to use enough sanitizer to cover the entire hand. Dr. Larson suggests half to one teaspoon. Sanitizer also works only when it’s still wet, so health experts advise against using paper towels to dab your hands. Give the product at least 10 seconds to complete its job, then rub your hands together or let them air-dry.

Please follow local guidance. The gym, an escape and haven in the day-to-day lives of millions, has become yet another source of anxiety in the age of coronavirus. As cases of Covid-19 rise in the U.S., health officials are urging people to practice social distancing. That could make spin classes and yoga sessions seem more harmful than healthy. Yet many fitness fanatics crave exercise more than ever and are forging forward, while taking precautions. Tony Maloney,      the fitness center manager at National Institute for Fitness and Sport in Indianapolis, points out that people should be exercising now more than ever. “When endorphin levels go up, it can counteract the stress response that is so damaging to the immune system,” he says. “Exercise also improves mental health. When you’re feeling down or stressed, exercise can put a smile on your face.” Madison Mitteness still braves the treadmill at her gym in New York City, but says she won’t touch the dumbbells or weight machines for fear of germs. Her logic, that the more people touch shared objects, the higher their risk of transmitting a virus, isn’t unfounded. But according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, coronavirus spreads more easily between people standing within about 6 feet than through contact with contaminated surfaces. Cleaning and disinfecting surfaces appears to lower the chances of transmission. Gregory Poland, director of the Vaccine Research Group at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., says the gym isn’t necessarily riskier than any other communal area, but people should remain vigilant. His tactic at the gym has been to use hand sanitizer—at least 60% alcohol-based—liberally every time he touches a piece of equipment. In general, things like gym towels, he says, are less risky, since fewer people touch them. “If someone with the virus has coughed or sneezed and then touches an inanimate object like a dumbbell or even the pen for a sign-in sheet, there is an increased chance of transmission, but no more than the flu,” he says. In the past four months there have been over 800 cases of novel coronavirus in the U.S. that we know of and, as of Tuesday, 28 deaths. If you live in a city with an outbreak, Dr. Poland suggests skipping the studio and getting your endorphin fix at home through an online class or app. Outdoor exercise is also safe, he says, as long as you keep a distance from people. “A triathlon where you are jammed up with others wouldn’t be smart,” he says. However, if you live someplace that has not experienced an outbreak, he suggests taking the same precautions you would during flu season. He recommends getting a flu vaccine and working out in areas with a minimum of 3 to 5 feet between pieces of equipment or other people. And don’t just rinse your hands. Wash them for at least 20 seconds. “I have never seen a lay person wash their hands properly,” he says. “You put your fingertips, not your palms, in your eyes, nose or mouth. No one washes their fingertips.” Gyms and fitness studios across the country have stepped up hygiene messaging and measures to give members peace of mind. Barry’s Bootcamp advised clients to avoid “kissing, hugging and the sharing of cups and water bottles” at the gym. And Equinox says it is disinfecting all clubs with a hospital-grade solution three times a day. It’s asked instructors to eliminate skin-to-skin contact such as adjustments in yoga. Keith Worts, the CEO of Crunch Signature, says the company hasn’t seen a change in usage over the past three weeks. “The biggest behavioral shift we’ve seen is that more people wipe down their equipment before and after use,” he says. Nathan Reyna,      a member of Elite by NYSC, an upscale offshoot of New York Sports Club, says he feels less paranoid going to the gym because he feels that his gym’s management is taking the coronavirus threat seriously. “Not only have they emailed tips on how to combat the virus, but they have amped up deep cleans,” he says. Mr. Reyna, who says the gym is both his social hub and stress reliever, still takes extra precaution and brings his own disinfectant wipes and thoroughly washes his hands before and after his workouts. “I see a lot more people doing the same,” he says. “Maybe this should be the new norm.” Kate Pallardy,      an elite runner and New York Sports Club member, says she’s always washed her hands well pre- and post-workout. “For me, this is like the scares we’ve had with Zika, SARS or the flu,” she says. “No virus will ever stop me from working out.” The continued spread of coronavirus has put hygiene at the top of everyone’s mind. Gyms and fitness studios are urging members to follow the CDC guidelines for preventing the spread of Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. Beyond washing your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and not touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands, here’s what fitness companies and health experts are suggesting people do to stay clean while exercising: * If you or someone in your household is sick, stay home from the gym. * Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash. * Avoid the sauna and steam room. Those with colds often use them to break up congestion in the sinuses and lungs. * Use the disinfectant wipes available at the gym to wipe down machines and equipment before and after each use. * For surface cleaning, check with your gym to see if its products say “disinfectant” on the label and include an EPA registration number. * Use hand sanitizers that are at least 60% alcohol. * Bring your own yoga mat to class. * Avoid contact such as hands-on assists, passing over membership cards at check-in or high-fives with instructors. * Avoid packed classes where students are shoulder-to-shoulder. Try to maintain 6 feet of distance from other people. * Work out at home using a jump rope or an app or streamable workout.  Copyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Medical professionals say it is important not to rush to buy supplements and vitamins that promise to enhance your immune system; there isn’t much evidence that such products do any good. Instead, they say, stick with the more mundane, but proven, approaches: • Keep your stress levels down. It’s a bit of a vicious cycle, of course: The more you stress about the virus, the more likely you are to suffer from it. “Stress can certainly hurt your immune system,” says            Morgan Katz,      an assistant professor of infectious diseases at Johns Hopkins University. “Do not panic, try to minimize stress.” Andrew Diamond,      chief medical officer of One Medical, a nationwide network of primary-care providers, says the stress hormone cortisol turns off cells in your immune system. He recommends engaging in activities that people find relaxing, such as meditation. • Exercise. Low- and moderate-intensity exercise naturally lowers cortisol levels and helps with immune-system function, says Dr. Diamond. One Medical recommends 30 to 60 minutes of exercise a day. If you’re apprehensive about germs in the gym, walk or run outside. But it is important not to go overboard. A recent study found high-performance athletes have an increased risk of infection, says            Elizabeth Bradley,      medical director of the Cleveland Clinic’s Center for Functional Medicine. “Exercise helps boost the immune system, but we have to be careful not to overexercise because it can weaken your immune system,” she says. • Get adequate sleep. For adults, that means getting seven to eight hours of sleep a night. Children should get more, depending on their age. • Make sure your vaccines are up-to-date, especially the flu vaccine. • Eat plenty of plain yogurt every day. “It’s really an easy way to boost your probiotics and help support your microbiome,” Dr. Katz says. “It helps to support the good bacteria that live in your body, which help to fight bad bacteria or viruses.” Dr. Katz also suggests avoiding antibiotics unless you must take them because they deplete the good bacteria in the system, leaving you more vulnerable to other infections. Other foods that can help support the microbiome include garlic, onion, ginger, sauerkraut and fermented foods, says Dr. Bradley. • Watch your diet. Stick to a healthful, balanced diet filled with lots of colorful fruits and vegetables to ensure you’re getting enough zinc and vitamin D and other important vitamins and minerals. Most experts say you should be able to get enough of these vitamins and minerals through your diet, and extra supplementation isn’t necessary. But because vitamin D deficiency is relatively common, experts do recommend supplementation if levels are low. Dr. Bradley recommends eating lots of dark green, leafy vegetables and berries, as well as nuts and seeds, and to minimize foods with sugar and trans fats, which aren’t as nutrient-dense. Your immune system needs fuel, so avoid ultralow-carbohydrate diets, experts say. In addition, drink lots of water and reduce alcohol consumption, which can disrupt your sleep. • Stop smoking or vaping. Smokers and those with respiratory disease have a higher rate of serious illness and complications from coronavirus. “Anything that is challenging to your lungs is going to work in the wrong direction,” says Dr. Diamond.

That is a concern for the Fed because the Treasury market is the most liquid and actively traded bond market in the world, providing a backbone for everything from hedging trades to conducting monetary policy. “These changes are being made to address highly unusual disruptions in Treasury financing markets associated with the coronavirus outbreak,” the New York Fed, which conducts the central bank’s market operations, said in a Thursday statement.

The maps captured trends for patients of Providence, which owns 51 hospitals and shared the results early Monday with its hospital executives. Seattle’s outbreak, depicted in blue dots, was already ballooning. And now Portland had its own blue specks. If the pattern held, his hospitals were about to be severely tested. “That was the alarm bells going off,” he said. Mr. Olson said Renton, Wash.-based Providence has sent its real-estate team to hunt for empty lots suitable for medical tents, an exercise under way in all its markets. Also on the Catholic health system’s list of possible extra space for patients: a former dormitory for nuns. Hospitals across the country are bracing for an expected surge in patients as the U.S. coronavirus outbreak widens, with more than 1,320 cases across 42 states and the District of Columbia as of Thursday, according to Johns Hopkins University and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. Hospital executives say they are scouring inside and outside their walls for space to put patients, tightly managing dwindling stocks of medical supplies and hunting for critical equipment and extra health-care workers, who are already in high demand and at risk for quarantine from exposure while on the job.

Testing in the U.S. has been wholly inadequate; history may come to see this as the great scandal of the epidemic. “Anybody that needs a test gets a test; they’re there, they have the tests, and the tests are beautiful,” as the president said last weekend, is on a par with “If you like your doctor you can keep your doctor” as a great, clueless lie. Because of the general lack of testing we don’t have a firm sense of the number of the infected and the speed and geography of spread. Many people would be working sick, afraid of losing pay or job security if they take time off. Some would be at home, unable for financial or other reasons to see a doctor or go to a hospital. In the past few days the World Health Organization declared a pandemic. The physician used by Congress reportedly said behind closed doors that 70 million to 150 million Americans will be infected. The Harvard epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch estimated 20% to 60% of adults world-wide might catch the disease. Cases are rising in Spain, France and Germany, where Prime Minister Angela Merkel warned that 70% of the nation could wind up infected. The president gave a major Oval Office address Wednesday night aimed at quelling fears; it was generally labeled “unsettling.” Immediately after, Tom Hanks announced that he and wife Rita Wilson have tested positive, and the National Basketball Association suspended its season after a player tested positive. Health professionals and scientists have been on TV explaining what they know, and they’ve been impressive—crisply professional, helpful in conveying the contour of things. This week I spoke to a physician with a small practice on Long Island who’s dealing with problems on the ground.  "

The new coronavirus, like SARS, MERS and the seasonal flu, enters our bodies, finds its way inside our DNA and commandeers it to make more copies of itself. Viruses are, in many ways, the ultimate parasites. Yet we, like every other creature on Earth, have a complex relationship with them. Many of the traits that make viruses so effective at transmitting disease also make them an essential part of our genetic makeup. As it turns out, their contributions to our genome over the eons account for a range of important human qualities. Viruses sit at the edge of our definition of living things. They are tiny bits of genetic material enclosed by a protective shell. Alone, they sit lifeless and inert, waiting for a favorable environment in which to reproduce. Viruses are carried to their unwilling hosts by insects, droplets in the air, contact with infected surfaces and other mechanisms that bring cells of different species together. When a virus encounters a host cell, a chain reaction of molecular events is set in motion: The virus attaches itself to the outer wall of the cell, enters inside, travels to the cell’s genome, merges with its genes and then tricks the host’s genome into making copies of itself. The host cell becomes a factory for new viruses and can produce as many as a million of them before it dies. This explosive growth can happen simultaneously in tissues throughout the body. As the virus spreads in one individual’s body, it can escape via water droplets expelled from the air in the lungs, sweat produced by sweat glands or fluids produced by other organs, thereby passing the infection to others.

The big difference, as the Fred Hutch guys also note, is that Seattle’s people have been saturated in warnings that Wuhan’s population only started receiving two months into the epidemic. Stay home, avoid crowds, wash your hands religiously. A few days ago Italians seemed not to be heeding the advice. Now they are. Caitlin Rivers, a Johns Hopkins epidemiologist, tweeted this week that “event closures have an important role, but individual behavior changes are even more important.” If this column has been telling you anything since January, it’s that the coronavirus was coming and protecting yourself is the best way to protect the country. During the 2003 SARS panic in Hong Kong, routine cold and flu diagnoses declined sharply—influenza was down 88%—thanks partly to people practicing safer hygiene. Or take Japan right now: A harsh flu season appears to have abruptly reversed itself since Japanese citizens began adopting coronavirus precautions. Flu visits to doctors are down 60% in relation to past years. Though it’s still early, Japan has lost 19 people to the coronavirus—and 3,300 last year to the flu. To state the obvious, measures that stop transmission of the flu also prevent transmission of coronavirus.  "

No doubt about it.” Roughly 80% of Covid-19 cases tend to be mild or moderate, and more than 62,000 people globally have recovered. Older people or those with underlying health conditions are at a higher risk. Mr. Thibault’s ordeal began with a much-awaited school trip abroad, a journey to Europe from Feb. 14 to 22 that went through Italy. Two others from the trip also tested positive, although they weren’t hit as hard as Mr. Thibault. The married father of two is the popular vice principal of student life at Saint Raphael Academy, a private Catholic school in Pawtucket, a suburb of Providence. He knew travel would expand his students’ minds and was thrilled to chaperone the nine-day adventure that began in Milan and ended in Barcelona. When the group of 38 people left the U.S., coronavirus was certainly in the news but there “were no cases of community-spread coronavirus in Italy and no CDC travel warning in effect,” the school said in a previous statement. When the group landed in Milan, Mr. Thibault thought it was strange to see people in hazmat suits in the airport, but everything seemed calm. The group headed to Cinque Terre on the Italian Riviera, and began what would be just two days of sightseeing in Italy. But just in that short period, he began to hear about Italy cordoning off some towns, and by the time they left for the French Riviera he was relieved to be leaving Italy. It was apparently too late. Italy would become one of the hardest-hit places for the virus. A self-described germaphobe, Mr. Thibault isn’t sure exactly how he became infected. He said he used hand sanitizer constantly on the trip. But the group’s local tour guide said he felt like he was coming down with the flu, and he and Mr. Thibault passed a microphone back and forth to talk to the students. Mr. Thibault is unsure if the tour guide ever tested positive. Mr. Thibault had no symptoms during the trip, but he felt unusually sluggish on the flight back to the U.S. “Something is wrong,” he told his wife when he finally got home to Rhode Island near midnight on Saturday, Feb. 22. He went straight to bed, and then the next day, went to a walk-in clinic. Mr. Thibault has asthma, but he exercises everyday and said he rarely gets sick. He said he told the clinic he had been to Italy and wondered aloud if he could have the novel coronavirus. He was told he didn’t fit the criteria at the time for the test because he didn’t really have the symptoms, which can include a fever or shortness of breath. He stayed home from work, but just got worse, with growing fatigue, a dry cough and something that resembled bronchitis. He went to a hospital but was again told he didn’t meet the criteria for the test, he said. Doctors there were concerned, however, and Mr. Thibault said he quickly got a call from the Rhode Island Department of Health, which told him to get tested immediately. A health department spokesman said the agency can’t comment on any specific patient, but noted that the CDC’s guidance for testing has evolved. “We have reviewed each Rhode Island case carefully,” the spokesman said. “In each of those instances, the health-care facilities involved all responded appropriately.” By later in the week, Mr. Thibault was at the Miriam Hospital, where he was admitted. He tested positive for the virus. He says the virus now hit him “like a hurricane.” He was weak and had trouble breathing. The hospital whisked him into the ICU, where nurses donned hazmat-style suits to enter his room. They inserted a breathing tube, and put another tube down his throat for medicine to deal with pneumonia that developed in his lungs, he said. Gagging and coughing, Mr. Thibault said he felt scared. His lungs would fill with saliva and nurses would dash in and clear them out, only to have to do it again two hours later. “The feeling of choking. That was the worst part,” he said. “You feel like you’re asphyxiating, and you’re panicking because you can’t breathe.” The agony went on for days. His wife, and his two children, ages 20 and 15, were unable to visit, lest they become infected, too. “Just get through the next hour, the next hour, the next hour,” Mr. Thibault told himself. “It’s just one time you quit and then you’re dead.” Even though he was partially sedated, his mind kept spinning. Last week, he forced himself to write a note to his wife, telling her that if his lungs collapsed, to not keep him on life support. “I just didn’t want to have that on my wife’s shoulders. I just didn’t want her to do that,” he said. “I’m glad she never had to read that note.” Slowly he began to get better. The doctors took out his breathing tube and to his relief, his lungs picked up the pace. When he could speak, he thanked the medical staff. “What these people did for me in that last two weeks, I’m forever indebted to them,” he said. He said he is “coming through this” and hopes to be able to leave the hospital by the weekend. He said he has turned on the television and caught up on the news of the escalating virus. He is worried some people don’t realize how serious it can be and hopes people are taking the recommended safety steps, from washing hands frequently to staying home when sick, to avoid community spread. “It almost killed me,” he said. “It’s alarming when I hear people minimize it as a simple cold. It was no simple cold for me.” Get an early-morning coronavirus briefing each weekday, plus a health-news update Fridays: Sign up here.

Their divergent experiences hold urgent lessons for the U.S. and other democracies where the pandemic is at an earlier stage. Seoul, accepting the illness had arrived, kept its borders open and aggressively tracked down the infected using data and extensive tests. Rome, after escalating attempts to reduce travel and social interactions, quarantined the whole country, while only screening people once they had shown symptoms. The countries have two of the biggest coronavirus outbreaks outside China. But South Korea’s known infections are now stabilizing at around 8,000, whereas Italy’s are rising relentlessly past 17,000. South Korea has 67 deaths as of Friday. Italy’s death toll was a far higher 1,266 by late Friday, because the virus has hit its large and vulnerable elderly population and overwhelmed hospitals in some areas. The different trajectories reflect how policy efforts have interacted with the response of the population, shaped by culture and recent experience. In South Korea, as in Japan and Taiwan, the lingering cultural imprint of Confucianism gives a paternalistic state a freer hand to intrude in people’s lives during an emergency, says Lee Sung-yoon, an international-relations professor at Tufts University. “Most people willingly submit themselves to authority and few complain,” Mr. Lee said. “The Confucian emphasis on respect for authority, social stability and the good of the nation above individualism is an ameliorating factor in a time of national crisis.”  "

The tech industry has long touted how ubiquitous connectivity, flashy gadgets and big data can improve people’s lives. The novel coronavirus epidemic is putting that bold promise to the test. Health officials across Asia-Pacific, home to the first waves of virus contagion, have sought to repurpose existing technology to combat the fast-spreading virus. They are using smartphone-location tracking to piece together movements of suspected cases, developing government-run apps to monitor individuals’ health and keeping an eye on people’s temperature in the street with thermal goggles. These new responses supplement traditional tactics such as quarantining sick people and canceling mass public events. But the tech-savvy tactics have yet to demonstrate broadly whether they are more game-changer than gimmick. Still, countries elsewhere might look to these solutions as the epidemic spreads.

Both are respiratory diseases that spread through droplets of fluid from the mouth and nose of someone who is infected. Both are contagious, produce similar symptoms and can be deadly. But there are some major differences. While both produce many of the same symptoms—fever, cough and muscle aches—and are particularly hard on the elderly, they come from two different families of viruses. People have more protection from the flu because there is a vaccine and they are exposed to flu viruses every year. There is no vaccine yet to protect people against Covid-19, the disease caused by the new virus. “I think what we’re seeing with Covid-19 is what influenza would look like without a vaccine,” said            Neil Fishman,      who is chief medical officer at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania and an infectious-disease specialist.  Scientists haven’t yet established exactly how deadly or transmissible the new virus is. But so far the new coronavirus appears to be deadlier than the seasonal flu, which kills thousands of Americans every season. Calculations of the mortality rate for Covid-19 have ranged between 2% and 3.4% since the virus was identified in China in January, according to World Health Organization data. Those percentages are derived by dividing the number of confirmed deaths globally into the number of confirmed cases. By contrast, the seasonal flu has a death rate of approximately 0.1%. Covid-19’s higher death rate is one reason that billionaire global-health philanthropist            Bill Gates      recently warned in an article in the New England Journal of Medicine that “Covid-19 has started behaving a lot like the once-in-a-century pathogen we’ve been worried about.” But public-health scientists say the real death rate is probably lower than the current estimates. U.S. health officials suggested in another article in the New England Journal of Medicine that the death rate could be well below 1%. (Other estimates have ranged between 1% and 2%.) That’s because current calculations are based on tallies of people who were ill enough to be tested, they wrote. Epidemiologists say they are certain there are many more people who were infected but didn’t receive a test—either because they weren’t ill enough to get one or didn’t have access to a test. Problems with a test developed in the U.S. means many people haven’t been able to get one. Studies suggest there are also people who were infected but had no symptoms. “We don’t know the proportion of mild or asymptomatic cases,”            Marc Lipsitch,      professor of epidemiology at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and director of the Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics, said in a recent teleconference. In addition, the mortality rate has differed by region and by intensity of transmission, according to a report by an international mission to China of experts led by the WHO. It was 5.8% in an explosive initial outbreak in Wuhan. But in other, less-hard-hit areas of China, which had more time to prepare to care for patients, it was 0.7%. The rate in China has come down over time, the report said. In South Korea, which has had more than 7,000 cases, the mortality rate is 0.7%. To calculate the “infection fatality rate”—meaning an infected person’s risk of death—will require large-scale studies to determine how many people in an area where there has been an outbreak have antibodies to the virus in their blood, Dr. Lipsitch said. That would show how many people had been infected, he said. Have you been tested for flu or coronavirus? What was your experience? Join the conversation below. Two blood tests have been licensed in China to conduct such studies, according to the WHO. The new coronavirus, called SARS CoV-2, infects the lower respiratory tract. About 80% of people in a cohort of nearly 56,000 people in China had either mild or moderate illnesses, according to the report by the experts who traveled to China. Those illnesses started with a fever, dry cough, fatigue and other flulike symptoms, but sometimes included shortness of breath and progressed to a mild form of pneumonia, according to the report. Another 13.8% became severely ill, requiring oxygen, and 6.1% were critical, meaning respiratory and organ failure, according to the report. People over the age of 60 and those with underlying conditions such as cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease, diabetes and cancer were at highest risk, the report said. Get an early-morning briefing about the coronavirus each weekday and a weekly Health newsletter when the crisis abates. There are contradictory reports of how transmissible Covid-19 is. The disease does not seem to spread as easily as the flu, according to the WHO, which found that most of the spread in China was through close contacts like family members. Other disease modeling suggests the new virus is more transmissible than the flu. Experts say the new coronavirus may appear to be more transmissible than flu right now because people have at least some immunity to seasonal flu viruses, since the flu goes around every year, and there is a flu vaccine. About 34 million people in the U.S. have had the flu this season, which is still ongoing but starting to ease, according to the latest flu report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Of them, about 20,000 have died. Flu strains change slightly every year, and the number of deaths depends on how severe the strains that are circulating that season are, according to the CDC. The most severe flu pandemic in recent history killed tens of millions of people in 1918 and 1919, meaning more than 2.5% of those it infected, according to CDC research.

That is, if you really want to clean your phone. Three people I spoke with over the past week said they did not clean their smartphones—and they’re all leading experts on microbiology and infectious disease. WAIT! WHAT? I thought smartphones were dirtier than a toilet bowl. Heck, even academic studies, like this one from my favorite bedtime reading, the Journal of Hospital Infection, have found considerable amounts of bacteria, including fecal matter, on phone screens. And yet all these experts said some variation of the same thing when I asked about combating coronavirus: thoroughly clean your hands; don’t touch your face; don’t worry about your phone. How have you cleaned your phone in the past? Do you plan to change your ways? Join the conversation below. Sure, except what if you’re one of those people where your smartphone is basically an extension of your hand? What if I touch a dirty subway pole, then touch my phone, then my phone touches my face? What if someone sneezes directly on my iPhone screen? What if I’m the kind of person who licks my phone? (Don’t judge.) A recent study found that, on surfaces such as metal, glass or plastic, coronavirus can survive for anywhere between two hours and nine days. “It’s possible, theoretically, for this to live on a smartphone. If you had it out and someone sneezed or coughed on it and then you handled the phone, you could pick up infection that way,” says            Daniel R. Kuritzkes,      chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. “People should keep their phones close to themselves. There is very little risk involved then.” “My phone is the least of my concerns,” says            Alex Berezow,      a microbiologist and vice president at the American Council on Science and Health. “Worry about touching door handles that thousands of other people touch.” After days of disinfecting my phone like a surgical tray, I was shocked. Phone cleaning is certainly not as cut and dried as you thought. After hours of research and scrubbing phones with everything from            Clorox      wipes to Lysol toilet-bowl cleaner, I’ve come up with some basic lessons for what you can do—and not do—with that petri dish phone of yours. Let’s be very clear: Even when there isn’t a pandemic sweeping the globe, your phone can get dirty. Generally, that filth is not an issue, says            Emma Hayhurst,      a microbiologist at the University of South Wales and co-author on the aforementioned Journal of Hospital Infection paper. “We were trying to avoid mass panic about mucky phones. When you are healthy, it’s really not a problem.” Translation: You should clean your phone—just not compulsively. “We don’t need to be obsessively washing our phones right now. If people are coming into contact with coronavirus patients, then, yes. Wash your phone all the time. Not because there is evidence that it will transmit via a phone but because there is no evidence that it won’t,” says Dr. Hayhurst. It’s long been the guidance of            Apple,            Samsung      and other phone makers to just use a microfiber cloth to shine up your device. All my new infectious-disease friends, however, say that to effectively kill the virus on a surface, you need disinfectant solution—for instance, something with at least 55% isopropyl alcohol. On Monday, I reported that Apple updated its website to remove its blanket ban on all cleaning supplies. It now gives the OK to use a 70% isopropyl alcohol wipe or Clorox disinfecting wipe on the surface of all Apple products. Google also confirmed that it’s OK to use isopropyl alcohol or Clorox wipes to clean its Pixel devices. After publication of this column, Samsung updated its cleaning guidance to include alcohol-based cleaners. It now advises Galaxy owners to dampen a cloth with a disinfectant or alcohol-based solution and wipe gently. It says not to apply liquid directly onto your phone. Of course, the big question right now is, where do you BUY the wipes? Can you use soap and water, as many have asked me? Sure, but avoid using rough paper towels or sponges on the screen. And never use bleach. The big cleaning-solution fear cited by smartphone makers is damage to your phone screen’s oleophobic layer. This is a protective coating on your screen that repels both water and oil. Basically, it helps minimize fingerprints and smudges. “Cleaning products and abrasive materials will diminish the coating and might scratch your iPhone,” Apple’s website reads. I took it upon myself to test that, as you’ll see in the video above. Using a brand-new iPhone 8, I wiped the screen 1,095 times with Clorox disinfecting wipes. I figured that’s the equivalent of wiping down your phone every day for the three years you might own it. The only thing showing any wear after all that wiping? My poor, wrinkly fingers. The coating still repelled drops of olive oil like it did when I first took it out of the box. So I upped the effort. I was told that hydrochloric acid, found in toilet-bowl cleaner, would take it right off. Yet after five minutes of scrubbing, it was still fine. Soft Scrub with some bleach for five minutes? Still in decent shape. Finally, I decided to let it sit in a stew of toilet-bowl cleaner for two hours, then I threw in a five-minute rubdown with nail-polish remover, which has acetone. That did it…just about. (The phone, miraculously, still worked.) Should you do any of that? Absolutely not, but these screens are far more resistant to these products than I’d thought. Plus, the oleophobic layer on your phone is going to wear from normal use anyway. When cleaning with your disinfecting wipes, however, avoid getting liquid in the ports. Even if most phones are now water resistant, that resistance wears over time. There’s a big difference between cleaning glass or metal and cleaning silicone, plastic or genuine leather. Apple provides good advice on cleaning the various materials its cases are made of. Even if you don’t have an official Apple case, these tips can be helpful. When I was at a hospital last week, I met a nurse who had a phone case especially for work. (She still cleans it every day.) If you’re not into getting your phone and hands all wet, you can try a UV sanitizing gadget like the $100 PhoneSoap Go. Pop your phone in the tiny tanning bed for 10 minutes and the company claims to kill 99.9% of bacteria and germs on it. Why use this instead of a wipe? Well, because apparently we suck at cleaning. People don’t cover the whole phone well with disinfecting solutions, according to PhoneSoap chief executive and co-founder            Wesley LaPorte.      Plus, if you don’t let the cleaning solution sit for a while—Clorox recommends four minutes on its container—some bacteria might survive. “This disinfects in a consistent manner,” Mr. LaPorte says. I was too busy killing oleophobic coating to test this independently, but the microbiologists I spoke with said UV light can be an effective way to kill bacteria. PhoneSoap says it has seen 1,000% revenue growth this year, due to increased interest in phone cleaning since the coronavirus spread. Last week, inventory the company put up on Amazon sold out within an hour. Samsung is fine with you using PhoneSoap or its competitors—and is even offering free UV cleaning at select Samsung stores, if you feel like venturing out. Apple doesn’t explicitly offer in-store cleaning, but store employees are known to clean gadgets using wipes with 70% isopropyl alcohol. Our anxieties are at an all-time high, understandably. If cleaning makes you feel better, grab some wipes and go to town. Wipe for hours—even days. Your phone will be just fine. Just remember, you really don’t need to. Unless you’re one of those crazy phone lickers. —Kenny Wassus contributed to this column. —For more WSJ Technology analysis, reviews, advice and headlines, sign up for our weekly newsletter.

More than 100 safety masks and respirators on Amazon were counterfeit or had unverifiable protection and certification claims, a Wall Street Journal investigation found. There were several listings, for example, for a protective mask listed from a company called Benehal, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, or Niosh, warned last year was a counterfeit. Another listing for pink, latex-free gloves promised to “prevent coronavirus, flu and pneumonia.” No consumer-grade gloves do that. Several other Amazon postings for fisherman-style hats with plastic face shields were being marketed as protection that “effectively isolates saliva carrying viruses.”  "

If this government-ordered shutdown continues for much more than another week or two, the human cost of job losses and bankruptcies will exceed what most Americans imagine. This won’t be popular to read in some quarters, but federal and state officials need to start adjusting their anti-virus strategy now to avoid an economic recession that will dwarf the harm from 2008-2009. The vast social-distancing project of the last 10 days or so has been necessary and has done much good. Warnings about large gatherings of more than 10 people and limiting access to nursing homes will save lives. The public has received a crucial education in hygiene and disease prevention, and even young people may get the message. With any luck, this behavior change will reduce the coronavirus spread enough that our hospitals won’t be overwhelmed with patients.            Anthony Fauci,            Scott Gottlieb      and other disease experts are buying crucial time for government and private industry to marshal resources against the virus. Yet the costs of this national shutdown are growing by the hour, and we don’t mean federal spending. We mean a tsunami of economic destruction that will cause tens of millions to lose their jobs as commerce and production simply cease. Many large companies can withstand a few weeks without revenue but that isn’t true of millions of small and mid-sized firms. Even cash-rich businesses operate on a thin margin and can bleed through reserves in a month. First they will lay off employees and then out of necessity they will shut down. Another month like this week and the layoffs will be measured in millions of people. The deadweight loss in production will be profound and take years to rebuild. In a normal recession the U.S. loses about 5% of national output over the course of a year or so. In this case we may lose that much, or twice as much, in a month. Our friend            Ed Hyman,      the Wall Street economist, on Thursday adjusted his estimate for the second quarter to an annual rate loss in GDP of minus-20%. Treasury Secretary            Steven Mnuchin’s      assertion on Fox Business Thursday that the economy will power through all this is happy talk if this continues for much longer. If GDP seems abstract, consider the human cost. Think about the entrepreneur who has invested his life in his Memphis ribs joint only to see his customers vanish in a week. Or the retail chain of 30 stores that employs hundreds but sees no sales and must shut its doors. Or the recent graduate with $20,000 in student-loan debt—taken on with the encouragement of politicians—who finds herself laid off from her first job. Perhaps she can return home and live with her parents, but what if they’re laid off too? How do you measure the human cost of these crushed dreams, lives upended, or mental-health damage that result from the orders of federal and state governments? Some in the media who don’t understand American business say that China managed a comparable shock to its economy and is now beginning to emerge on the other side. Why can’t the U.S. do it too? This ignores that the Chinese state owns an enormous stake in that economy and chose to absorb the losses. In the U.S. those losses will be borne by private owners and workers who rely on a functioning private economy. They have no state balance sheet to fall back on. The politicians in Washington are telling Americans, as they always do, that they are riding to the rescue by writing checks to individuals and offering loans to business. But there is no amount of money that can make up for losses of the magnitude we are facing if this extends for several more weeks. After the first $1 trillion this month, will we have to spend another $1 trillion in April, and another in June? By the time Treasury’s small-business lending program runs through the bureaucratic hoops—complete with ordering owners that they can’t lay off anyone as a price for getting the loan—millions of businesses will be bankrupt and tens of millions will be jobless. Perhaps we will be lucky, and the human and capitalist genius for innovation will produce a vaccine faster than expected—or at least treatments that reduce Covid-19 symptoms. But barring that, our leaders and our society will very soon need to shift their virus-fighting strategy to something that is sustainable. Dr. Fauci has explained this severe lockdown policy as lasting 14 days in its initial term. The national guidance would then be reconsidered depending on the spread of the disease. That should be the moment, if not sooner, to offer new guidance on what might be called phase two of the coronavirus pandemic campaign. That will surely include strict measures to isolate and protect the most vulnerable—our elderly and those with underlying medical problems. This should not become a debate over how many lives to sacrifice against how many lost jobs we can tolerate. Substantial social distancing and other measures will have to continue for some time in some form, depending on how our knowledge of the virus and its effects evolves. But no society can safeguard public health for long at the cost of its overall economic health. Even America’s resources to fight a viral plague aren’t limitless—and they will become more limited by the day as individuals lose jobs, businesses close, and American prosperity gives way to poverty. America urgently needs a pandemic strategy that is more economically and socially sustainable than the current national lockdown. Copyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

As authorities moved to restrict social gatherings last week, bars and restaurants from New York to Berlin filled up with revelers, illegal “lockdown parties” popped up in France and Belgium, and campuses in the U.S. lit up for end-of-the-world dorm parties. So far, most young Covid-19 patients have experienced mild or no symptoms from the virus, while more severe cases are concentrated among those aged 50 and over. Data released last week by the National Health Institute in Italy, currently the world’s worst-hit country, shows mortality rates starting at 0% for patients aged 0 to 29 and edging up to peak at 19% for those over 90. Yet scientists say tests have shown children and young adults are no less likely than older people to get infected and transmit the virus. Epidemiologists are growing concerned that the millennial pushback against social-distancing measures—and an emerging generational divide about how the disease is perceived—could undo all efforts to slow the spread of the virus and put vulnerable people at high risk. President Trump on Monday stressed that young people can spread the virus even if they only have mild symptoms and recommended that Americans avoid restaurants and gatherings of more than 10 people.

The testing program they rolled out to combat it, though, was a small one. Limited testing has blinded Americans to the scale of the outbreak so far, impeding the nation’s ability to fight the virus through isolating the sick and their contacts, public-health officials say. As of early Wednesday, about 6,500 people in the U.S. had tested positive, data compiled by Johns Hopkins University show, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had reported only about 32,000 tests conducted at its facilities and other public-health labs. Limited testing is also keeping patients like Justin LaBor in the dark, despite recent improvements. Mr. LaBor, 36 years old, said he went to the emergency room at AtlantiCare Regional Medical Center in Pomona, N.J., Monday with a fever and dry cough, symptoms typical in a coronavirus infection. Doctors admitted him, but he hasn’t been tested for the virus, he said Tuesday, gasping for breath over the phone. “Everyone just told me there were no tests and I didn’t check all the boxes for the state,” said Mr. LaBor, a social-media marketer from Elwood, N.J., referring to the criteria that state labs require patients to meet before running tests. A New Jersey health-department spokeswoman said the state “has sufficient lab capacity to test those who meet the testing criteria.” An AtlantiCare spokeswoman said the hospital system “is not testing patients in a widespread manner for coronavirus.”  "

Other companies that scrape public social-media data have contracts in place with the agency and the National Institutes of Health, documents show. The push is in part being coordinated by a task force working in conjunction with the White House, and includes startups as well as tech giants such as  Alphabet Inc.’s  Google unit,  Facebook Inc.  and  Amazon.com Inc.  The task-force discussions involving the White House and tech companies were reported by The Wall Street Journal on Sunday. Other efforts are more grass-roots, with tech companies pitching state agencies and governments.  "

It will take its place among mostly seasonal respiratory infections. After a time, recurrent outbreaks will be moderated by a large number of potential carriers who have immunity from their last infection. And then we can ask some questions. The cost to Americans of the economic shutdown is vast. What are they getting for their money? Essentially less excess demand for respiratory ventilators and other emergency care than can currently be supplied. This demand will come largely from the elderly and chronically ill, who would be competing for these resources with the usual large number of old and ill people already suffering from acute respiratory distress as a result of routine flu and cold infections. A silver lining will be fewer cold and flu victims overall thanks to social distancing to fight Covid-19. Some number of respiratory deaths will be avoided (really delayed since we all die) but we’ll be spending a lot more than we’ve ever been willing to spend before to avoid flu deaths. Eighty-three percent of our economy will be suppressed to relieve pressure on the 17% represented by health care. This will have to last months, not weeks, to modulate the rate at which a critical mass of 330 million get infected and acquire natural immunity. Will people put up with it once they realize they are still expected to get the virus? Wouldn’t it make more sense to pour resources into isolating the vulnerable rather than isolating everyone? Basically aren’t we really just praying that summer will naturally suppress transmission and get us off the hook of an untenable policy? But then multiple experiments are under way. China seems to have quashed the spread beyond Hubei province and spared 99.9% of its population from infection—for now. Can China really hold off the virus from being reintroduced or re-exploding during the 18 months it may take for a vaccine to be invented and distributed?  "

Travel has been halted across the globe. Borders are shut. Hundreds of millions of people are in effective lockdown in the European Union, and the U.S. is heading in that direction. The crisis has erased trillions of dollars from global stock markets and imperiled the future of millions of small businesses around the world, along with the livelihoods of vast numbers of wage earners. In the months ahead, we are likely to see one of the sharpest economic contractions on record, and the downturn will undoubtedly serve as yet more evidence for those who have argued in recent years that globalization is coming to an end, or at least being rolled back. Nicolas Tenzer, chair of the Cerap think tank in Paris, argues that the rising barriers in response to the virus will strengthen “the populist and nationalist forces that have long called for reinforcing borders. It is a true gift for them.” The veteran U.S. market commentator Gary Shilling recently wrote, “The coronavirus’s depressing effects on the global economy and disruptions of supply chains is…driving the last nail into the coffin of the globalists.” Ian Bremmer, founder of the risk-consultancy Eurasia Group, sees a starker era ahead, including more palpable tension between the U.S. and China. “Globalization has been the biggest driver of economic growth,” he says. “Its trajectory is now shifting, largely for geopolitical reasons, and that will be accelerated by the coronavirus crisis.” In the midst of our current spiral, it is hard to resist such dire forecasts. But we should. There is every reason to think that our post-coronavirus future will see not an end to the globalizing trend of recent decades but a new chapter in that story. The sudden halt in commerce and travel precipitated by the outbreak will not snap back overnight, and the next few years will see a re-nationalization of some industries for countries that can. But when this crisis passes, we are likely to find fresh confirmation of what we already know about globalization: that it’s easy to hate, convenient to target and impossible to stop. Even before the virus, there were indications of both a pause and a modest pullback in globalization. Last year, global trade contracted a smidgen, by less than 1%, but at $19 trillion, it was still higher than any year before the record-setting 2018. As for China and the U.S., the dual effect of the Trump administration’s tariffs and the assertive nationalism of Xi Jinping put a brake on further integration. Data from the U.S. Census Bureau show that the total value of trade in goods between the two countries declined from $630 billion in 2017 to $560 billion in 2019. Even so, this pullback just puts the U.S. and China back at the trade level of 2013. And that amount, it should be noted, is almost five times what it was in 2001. In short, even after two years of trade war and diplomatic acrimony, the key axis of globalization was dented, but only barely. As the U.S. was erecting tariffs, the Chinese government, for its part, was ramping up spending abroad. Since 2014, China’s Belt and Road Initiative has invested almost $1 trillion in Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, Southeast Asia and elsewhere. According to the consulting firm Gavekal Dragonomics, the rate of new Chinese investment slowed to just over $100 billion last year, but the initiative remains an incontrovertible example of China-driven globalization.

The warnings Sunday came as the Federal Reserve slashed its benchmark interest rate to near zero, part of a bid to battle market disruptions. The move was welcomed by the Trump administration, which has expanded restrictions on travel from Europe and faced criticism for how it was processing frazzled travelers who were struggling to return home from overseas. The administration also sought to expand access to tests for the virus, as the White House said over the weekend that President Trump himself had tested negative for coronavirus. The federal government’s leading voice on infectious diseases said Americans—particularly younger people—must help prevent community spread of the virus, urging them to stay home and avoid unnecessary public outings.

There aren’t enough ventilators to intubate all patients with Covid-19 who have severe breathing trouble. The intensive-care unit is taking almost no patients older than 70, doctors said. A normally disused section of the hospital is filled with the critically ill and the hissing sound of oxygen. Patients lie quietly, with worried or exhausted faces, visible to others in the series of half-open rooms. Each focuses on the struggle to breathe. There are patients with airtight oxygen helmets over their heads, like transparent buckets taped at the neck. “Some of them would have needed intubation in intensive care,” anesthesiologist Pietro Brambillasca said. The rest ought to be better isolated, he said, where they can’t contaminate anyone. That is no longer possible. The number of ill has outstripped the hospital’s capacity to provide the best care for all.  "

It says such experiments could play an important role in the development of a vaccine against the new coronavirus, for which there are no proven treatments or vaccines. Unlike drugs, which are tested on people who already have a particular illness, vaccines have to be given to healthy people who are later exposed to a disease. Typically, this is done by giving an experimental vaccine to thousands of people in an area where an infection is circulating, and then tracking them for months or even years. The vaccine is considered successful if those who got the shot avoid infection. One way of getting a quicker read on a vaccine’s effectiveness is by giving it to people who are then deliberately infected with the bug in question. Such challenge studies are routinely used in the development of vaccines for the flu, common cold and other respiratory illnesses. Usually, a few dozen participants are tracked closely for a few weeks for signs of illness after infection. These trials don’t replace the larger field studies, but they help give direction on whether a vaccine is worth pursuing.  "

Emergency-room physicians at another hospital are having to reuse gowns. Some large hospitals already have exceeded the capacity of their intensive-care units.

The goal is to get real-time forecasts and other critical information to front-line health-care workers and public policy makers as the outbreak unfolds. Known as outbreak analytics, the approach attempts to go beyond confirmed cases and fatalities to gauge the total number of people who are likely to be infected by a virus—whether or not they show any symptoms. “Besides advancements in medicine, advancements in information technology and digital data are how we defeat this pandemic and prevent another Spanish flu-like outcome,” said            Brian Hopkins,      a vice president and principal analyst at Forrester Research Inc.  Outbreak analytics seeks to gather all available data on an epidemic, including confirmed cases, fatalities, test results, tracing contacts of infected people, maps of population densities and demographics, traveler flows and migration, availability of health-care services, drug stockpiles and other factors. The raw data is then processed into compatible formats—increasingly by machine-learning software trained to recognize patterns and clean up diverse data sources—and fed into algorithmic models. The models are designed to predict the number of new cases that are likely to arise in an exposed population, or peak infection rates under a given set of conditions, among other outcomes. Eyal Zimlichman,      chief medical officer and chief innovation officer at Sheba Medical Center in Israel, said the hospital relies on such data-driven forecasts to ensure it has sufficient personnel and resources in place as the coronavirus spreads. This includes doubling the capacity of its isolated coronavirus units and isolated intensive care unit, Dr. Zimlichman said. The hospital has treated 40 patients for Covid-19, including 30 who remain hospitalized, he said. As of Tuesday, there were more than 5,200 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 92 deaths in the U.S., and more than 190,000 cases world-wide. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began expanding the use of big-data tools in flu forecasting roughly seven years ago. The agency last year awarded $3 million in funding to a research team at the University of Massachusetts Amherst’s School of Public Health and Health Sciences to develop a data-based flu forecasting center. A group at Carnegie Mellon University received funding for a similar center. Both teams are using these forecasting tools to help contain the coronavirus, in part by pooling together dozens of analytic models from multiple sources. Open platforms allow forecasters to share data and code, a strategy that helps piece together consistent and accurate predictions. Nicholas Reich,      a biostatistician who leads the University of Massachusetts Amherst team, said one of the project’s goals is to provide user-friendly information on virus infections to the public, which could include the development of a smartphone app to issue more timely alerts. “If we can communicate the data effectively, we might change behavior,” Mr. Reich said in a statement last year announcing the CDC funding round. This could include telling elderly people to avoid shopping malls or keeping children with asthma from visiting a museum, he said. “The more accurate and up-to-date the observed date, the better the simulations,” said            Jim Hare,      a research vice president at technology research and advisory firm Gartner Inc. Mr. Hare said the strategy helps connect the dots across disparate data sources. Mobile-phone use, for example, can be used to identify individuals who were in close contact with known carriers of the virus based on location services apps on their cellphones, a strategy known as contact tracing, he said. But building accurate Covid-19 forecasting models can be challenging, he added, given the dearth of information on the virus: “It’s like only being able to accurately forecast the weather using a temperature gauge.” Tomás Pueyo,      a vice president at education-technology website Course Hero who created a widely shared forecast model for coronavirus, said early problems with test kits, combined with an overall dearth of testing, makes it difficult to build accurate models for the U.S. “Even if testing was perfect, we would still be undercounting because the illness takes time to show symptoms,” Mr. Pueyo said. “For the few early days during which you don’t have symptoms, you have it and you’re spreading it.” His model estimates the total number of coronavirus cases in the U.S. at roughly 60,000 as of Friday. On Monday, a team of experts at Oxford University said their research demonstrated the viability of a smartphone app to provide instant contact tracing—the ability to identify people who have had contact with confirmed Covid-19 cases—that would significantly help to contain the spread of coronavirus. Christopher Fraser,      a professor of pathogen dynamics at Oxford University’s Big Data Institute, who led the team, said the app could be used as a key data source for outbreak analytics. “What you get out will depend on details of algorithms and the way the data flows are set up,” Mr. Fraser said. “Everyone understands that privacy and security are paramount, but so is tracking and controlling this epidemic,” he said, adding that implementing many of these tools falls on public policy makers. —Jared Council contributed to this article.

A growing number of hospitals, including Boston’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital, NewYork-Presbyterian, the main facility of the University of California, San Francisco and some major systems in the hard-hit Seattle area, are starting to put off surgeries that aren’t urgent or emergencies. In addition to freeing up capacity, doctors say they don’t want to expose patients and workers to potential infection risk. Some hospitals are also asking primary-care and psychiatry patients and those who need other routine care to use the phone or telemedicine to visit doctors. “The less people we have to bring or move around our community, the better,” said Ann Prestipino, an executive and incident commander for Massachusetts General Hospital, which Monday will begin switching all outpatient visits to virtual care, where possible, and will postpone surgery that can be delayed, at the discretion of each service area. The hospital and its clinics typically handle one million outpatient visits annually, she said. Hospitals say procedures that often can wait include knee replacements, some gallbladder operations and certain spine procedures, which they are delaying in their bid to free doctors, nurses and beds for the most critically ill Covid-19 patients.

As China grapples with the outbreak, the company’s number-crunching points to slowly rebounding poultry prices as a key indicator of damage to the country’s economy—and how quickly it can ramp back up. “At a very, very deep level, modeling macroeconomic behavior is modeling human behavior,” Ms. Menker said. “And in times of crisis, food is a very basic starting point.” The wholesale price of chicken in China fell more than 50% between mid-December and mid-February as the government placed portions of the country in lockdown. Prices have slowly risen in recent weeks as the reported growth rate of new infections has slowed, according to Gro Intelligence, suggesting that demand for agricultural products is starting to bounce back.

At the same time, some recycling programs are being suspended because of concerns about the virus spreading. Starbucks Corp.  has said stores that remain open in North America would serve coffee only in disposable cups for takeout. Starbucks,  Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc.  and Tim Hortons—owned by Restaurant Brands International Inc.—have all stopped filling customers’ reusable cups, a U-turn after years of encouraging them.

It began with disruptions to supply chains and restrictions on travel and is now rapidly expanding via spontaneous and government-imposed “social distancing” measures such as closing schools and confining regional populations to their homes. Entire industries are shutting down. It is “a sudden stop to the global economy,” said Mohamed El-Erian, an adviser to German insurer Allianz. There is no clear historical precedent for the scale and nature of this shock. Some economists see U.S. output falling by more in the coming quarter than in the worst quarter of the 2008-09 recession. Nonetheless, previous episodes of pandemics, disasters and crises offer clues about what to expect, how policy makers make matters better or worse and the likely long-term consequences. A few lessons stand out. First, governments and the public always face a trade-off between economic stability and public health and safety. The more they prioritize health and safety, the bigger the near-term cost to the economy, and vice versa. Second, at the outset of the disaster, policy makers are coping with enormous uncertainty. Early responses are often timid or off-target and more sweeping action is delayed by political disagreement. “We learned that we need to prioritize speed, think in tranches, be visible and worry about how to pay for it later,” said Tim Adams who served in the Treasury Department during 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina and is now president of the Institute of International Finance. “If you wait to craft the perfect response, you’ll lose valuable time and you’ll miss something no matter what.”  "

China’s European relief efforts, while welcome, are small compared with European health-care needs. One temporary hospital in Milan alone will need 500 doctors and about 1,400 nurses for 400 intensive-care beds. But China’s initiatives have been accompanied by heavy publicity and are having a diplomatic impact. China has also sent coronavirus test kits and protective clothing to Italy as well as other European countries such as Spain, Poland and Greece. The help from China has won particular attention in Italy and some other virus-hit countries where many people feel let down by the European Union, whose struggle to organize any effective action has left an open door for Beijing to walk through. No other EU countries responded to an Italian plea for masks earlier in March, and German authorities temporarily impeded deliveries of medical supplies to Italy. “It’s good that China is making humanitarian gestures, but it should not be allowed to rewrite the history of where the virus originated and how their initial handling of it allowed for it to spread across the world,” said Thorsten Benner, head of the Global Public Policy Institute, a Berlin-based think tank. Still, he added: “This is a shocking failure of European solidarity. The impression in Italy, Spain, Serbia and so on is that the weaker links will be left alone” by the EU. The damage to the EU’s standing prompted the EU executive, the European Commission, to promise that Italy would get “whatever is necessary.” EU countries are increasingly facing their own coronavirus crisis, however, and are trying to muster all the supplies and medical staff they can for domestic use.

They are creating virus data sets, focusing computing resources on the search for vaccines, tracking the virus’s spread, improving the distribution of critical health care supplies and facilitating online educational tools—work for which my philanthropy, Schmidt Futures, is providing support. This effort reflects the entrepreneurial, results-driven ethos of today’s tech sector. But every American should be asking where we want the nation to be when the Covid-19 pandemic is over. How could the emerging technologies being deployed in the current crisis propel us into a better future? Consider big data and novel manufacturing. The government lacks a strong grasp of complex supply and distribution chains for life-critical medical equipment and other goods. Specialists in big data analytics should now turn to modeling these networks to develop real-time tracking and data visualization platforms to better inform policy decisions. The predictive maintenance and additive manufacturing that are gaining traction in the military should become more prominent in health care. Some hospitals are already using 3-D printers to fabricate respirator valves, and it’s saving lives. Companies like Amazon know how to supply and distribute efficiently. They will need to provide services and advice to government officials who lack the computing systems and expertise. We should also accelerate the trend toward remote learning, which is being tested today as never before. Online, there is no requirement of proximity, which allows students to get instruction from the best teachers, no matter what school district they reside in. There are already useful online learning tools, but they need to be more equitably distributed. Struggling school districts, community colleges and career technical training institutes could benefit if network connectivity becomes more affordable and applications become accessible to a wider range of learners. Science and engineering labs will also be prompted to think of new ways to integrate young talent; there will be experiments in remote internships and apprenticeships. The need for fast, large-scale experimentation will also accelerate the biotech revolution. Synthetic biology and AI-enabled computer modeling will help us to discover and test more new drugs. Companies and research centers are putting algorithms to work on large data sets to find correlations that would take human researchers years of painstaking laboratory work. As researchers show more results, government agencies like the FDA will face pressure to quicken the trial and vetting process for new drugs, and funding agencies will need to give researchers more flexibility to follow the discoveries wherever they lead.

But there’s little evidence to confirm that premise—and projections of the death toll could plausibly be orders of magnitude too high. Fear of Covid-19 is based on its high estimated case fatality rate—2% to 4% of people with confirmed Covid-19 have died, according to the World Health Organization and others. So if 100 million Americans ultimately get the disease, two million to four million could die. We believe that estimate is deeply flawed. The true fatality rate is the portion of those infected who die, not the deaths from identified positive cases. The latter rate is misleading because of selection bias in testing. The degree of bias is uncertain because available data are limited. But it could make the difference between an epidemic that kills 20,000 and one that kills two million. If the number of actual infections is much larger than the number of cases—orders of magnitude larger—then the true fatality rate is much lower as well. That’s not only plausible but likely based on what we know so far. Population samples from China, Italy, Iceland and the U.S. provide relevant evidence. On or around Jan. 31, countries sent planes to evacuate citizens from Wuhan, China. When those planes landed, the passengers were tested for Covid-19 and quarantined. After 14 days, the percentage who tested positive was 0.9%. If this was the prevalence in the greater Wuhan area on Jan. 31, then, with a population of about 20 million, greater Wuhan had 178,000 infections, about 30-fold more than the number of reported cases. The fatality rate, then, would be at least 10-fold lower than estimates based on reported cases. Next, the northeastern Italian town of Vò, near the provincial capital of Padua. On March 6, all 3,300 people of Vò were tested, and 90 were positive, a prevalence of 2.7%. Applying that prevalence to the whole province (population 955,000), which had 198 reported cases, suggests there were actually 26,000 infections at that time. That’s more than 130-fold the number of actual reported cases. Since Italy’s case fatality rate of 8% is estimated using the confirmed cases, the real fatality rate could in fact be closer to 0.06%.

The decision will draw pushback from some nursing-home officials, who have warned that such moves endanger residents who aren’t infected by the virus, because discharged patients may still be contagious. A group representing doctors who work in nursing homes, known as AMDA, the Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine, said in a recent resolution that “admitting patients with suspected or documented Covid-19 infection represents a clear and present danger to all of the residents of a nursing home.” “We’ve got an extraordinarily vulnerable population on our hands,” said Christopher Laxton, executive director of the group. Nursing homes’ older, often frail residents are particularly susceptible to the virus. Many nursing homes have also long struggled with infection control, according to federal inspection records and researchers. Covid-19, the respiratory illness caused by the new coronavirus, has been spreading rapidly in nursing homes, resulting in large outbreaks and more deaths across the U.S. The federal government has said there are cases in at least 147 nursing homes, with clusters and deaths reported in elder-living facilities from Louisiana to Vermont to Florida. At least 37 deaths have been tied to an outbreak in one Seattle-area nursing home, Life Care Center of Kirkland.  "

In a video streamed from his home in Delaware on Monday, Mr. Biden said he would focus on “what we should do to get this response fixed.” The remarks that followed weren’t encouraging. He characterized the Senate’s coronavirus relief bill as “a plan that let big corporations off the hook,” and “a $500 billion slush fund for corporations, with almost no conditions.” This rhetoric about slush funds is straight from the antibusiness left. Does Mr. Biden not understand the problem that companies are facing? They have to figure out how to remain solvent until the health crisis ends, otherwise nobody will be left to turn the lights back on. Under Nancy Pelosi’s coronavirus bill, companies that take federal aid would be put under a permanent $15 minimum wage. Adding such strings to emergency funding will make businesses reluctant to accept the relief, even if they really need it. Mr. Biden went on to insist that “Social Security checks need to be boosted now” and “student debt should be forgiven for now.” He had more details in a Sunday tweet, saying that any coronavirus relief legislation “should forgive a minimum of $10,000/person of federal student loans, as proposed by Senator Warren and colleagues.” Why is Mr. Biden working so hard to make himself look like a junior partner of the congressional wing of his party?

Environmental, social and governance investing was growing in popularity before the virus began to circulate, as investors flocked to companies that have taken steps to manage nonfinancial risks related to matters such as climate change, board diversity or human rights issues in the supply chain. But the pandemic has demonstrated on a large scale the importance of other factors that are paramount to ESG investors. Among them: disaster preparedness, continuity planning and employee treatment through benefits such as paid sick leave as companies direct employees to work from home. Our Morning Risk Report features insights and news on governance, risk and compliance. A group of 300 mutual funds that integrate ESG factors into their investment decisions attracted $21.4 billion in new money in 2019, compared with $5.4 billion a year earlier, according to data from Morningstar Inc. Companies should expect more investors to ask questions about resilience and contingency planning, viewing the issues in light of the pandemic as relevant to a company’s long-term performance, according to Jeff Meli, global head of research at British investment bank            Barclays      PLC. Down the line, those conversations could evolve to broader ESG discussions, including topics such as whether telecommuting could reduce a company’s carbon footprint, he said in an interview Tuesday. “There is obviously a lot of volatility and a lot of big open questions just in the very near term that need to get answered,” Mr. Meli said. “…Over the long term, I think if anything this would likely accelerate the focus on ESG from an investor standpoint.” Barclays on Tuesday said it would begin providing ESG assessments for each of the companies that it covers. Citigroup Inc.,      meanwhile, in a note to clients said investors are asking more questions about issues such as employee benefits and mortgage relief, with the goal of identifying corporate strategies to limit the economic damage from the pandemic. The bank said it expects the pandemic to affect priorities in ESG, as well as conversations on the pros and cons of having temporary workers and stock buybacks to become the new focus for corporate governance. The corporate response to the pandemic—for instance, the decision by car maker            Ford Motor Co.      and other companies to manufacture medical supplies—could highlight for some investors the role that private companies play in addressing social problems, according to George Serafeim, a professor of business administration at Harvard Business School who focuses on sustainability. “More and more people are understanding that companies are part of the solution,” Mr. Serafeim said, describing the impact of corporate strategies on issues such as climate change. Some investors agree, and note the pandemic’s impact on markets is a reminder that environmental and social problems are financial risks they need to manage appropriately. “We have long argued that companies don’t operate in a vacuum,” said Andrew Howard, head of sustainable research at U.K. asset manager Schroders PLC. “Their success reflects their ability to adapt to challenges and trends in the societies to which they belong. That is more true now than ever; social and environmental challenges, and investment drivers, are increasingly overlapping.”  Whether or not the pandemic sharpens investors’ focus on ESG factors remains to be seen. It’s possible investors could have the opposite reaction in the months and years ahead, viewing ESG and a focus on social policies as an impediment to a company’s financial recovery, said            Katherine Klein,      vice dean of the Wharton Social Impact Initiative at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School. At the very least, investors and prospective employees should view the crisis—and how companies respond—as an opportunity to ask questions about the social issues that matter to them, Ms. Klein said. “This is a real opportunity to say, ‘How you treat your employees matters a whole lot. Diversity matters. What are your benefits?’ ” she said.

Amid today’s global pandemic, key technology companies are in talks with federal and state governments about employing their tools against Covid-19.  Facebook ,  which holds a trove of geolocation information, is sharing disease-migration maps. Clearview AI, a facial-recognition tech firm, may be able to track infected patients and identify people they have met. Smart thermometers are recording and transmitting fevers in real time. The data firm Palantir is working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to collect and analyze vast information streams. All this and more, we hope, will help to stop the virus in its tracks, save lives and help Americans get back to normal. But such efforts—done in haste—also raise searching questions about the balance between privacy and public health. Decisions being made on the fly by governments, private firms and individuals will change the country’s digital social contract for years to come. China’s approach to monitoring its infected citizens is famously authoritarian, with a new app telling users whether they can move freely based on a personal health analysis—and, not incidentally, sharing their location with the police. Citizens in democracies would no doubt reject such intrusive measures, but the pandemic has spurred key countries to consider new infringements on privacy. British officials, for example, hope to roll out a new smartphone app that will alert users who have come in contact with an infected individual, using location data drawn from GPS, Wi-Fi networks and even Bluetooth beacons. A separate app, developed by researchers outside of government, will map British infections and share information with officials. Its developers say the U.K. government can delete the data at some point and pledge not to publicize the movements of infected patients. But South Korea has done just that. By analyzing cellphone locations, CCTV feeds and bank transactions, Seoul has established a publicly available website that tracks individual locations and contacts. Interested observers have already mined the data to make guesses about who is visiting “love hotels” and having affairs. Meanwhile, Israel’s Shin Bet domestic security service has established a system that combines individuals’ credit history with cell-based location information—and works even if a phone’s tracking is disabled.

The country managed to turn the rapidly deteriorating situation around quickly, however, by devising a system to reserve hospital beds for those most in need and creating extra space with help from its biggest companies. South Korea divided confirmed patients into four categories. Only the sickest and elderly went to hospitals. The young and asymptomatic went to dormitories, which were lent by  Samsung Life Insurance Co. ,  LG Display Co.  and others, equipped with little more than beds, Wi-Fi and the occasional television. The decision ensured that low-risk individuals remained quarantined under government watch. Thousands of South Korea’s virus patients have ridden out the past several weeks living in buildings where companies typically put up workers for off-site, multiday training. With Covid-19 cases skyrocketing daily, health officials around the globe fear their countries lack enough hospital beds, respirators, supplies and staffing to meet demand. Few, if any, can. But South Korea, where new infections have recently tapered off, offers an example of how the intense pressure on hospital beds and equipment can be alleviated.  "

Nearly two weeks ago Mr. Ferguson, an epidemiologist with Imperial College London, issued a report on Covid-19. Much of the public attention focused on his worst-case projection that there might as many as 2.2 million American and 510,000 British deaths. Fewer paid attention to the caveat that this was “unlikely,” and based on the assumption that nothing was done to control it. The report was one reason that led Prime Minister Boris Johnson to change policy and lock Britain down. Under the Imperial College model, the projection was that the steps Mr. Johnson had been taking would cut the number of projected deaths in half but still leave about a quarter million British dead. Now Mr. Ferguson has clarified his estimates. He told Parliament this week that he now reckons the number of deaths in the U.K. “would be unlikely to exceed 20,000”—and that many would be older people who would have died from other maladies this year. With the measures now in place, he believes Britain’s health service won’t be overwhelmed. Critics are bashing him for the revisions, but not so fast. Mr. Ferguson didn’t change his model so much as adjust for new circumstances. In particular he believes that Covid-19 is more transmissible than he previously had thought—but because strong measures had been implemented, deaths would be far lower than his worst-case scenario. There’s a warning here about science and journalism. Surely if we hope to neutralize a pandemic we don’t fully understand, we need to encourage a culture in which scientists feel able to adapt and clarify with new evidence. Scientists would also help themselves if, in explaining their findings, they would be more candid about the assumptions and variables.  "

After a decadelong U.S. economic expansion, not every company has entered this crisis with the same cash cushion.  Apple Inc.  ended the year with $247 billion in cash, securities and account receivables, enough to run its operations for more than a year even if it didn’t cut costs or sell a single iPhone. Discount retailer  Dollar General Corp.  had $240 million, enough for about four days, in the unlikely event it had to shut its doors and didn’t cut any costs. Dollar General said its business model generates significant cash flow and has performed well in a variety of economic cycles, and the company can tap lines of credit and good access to the capital markets. Apple declined to comment. Technology companies generally operate with more cash on hand than retailers, which often have assets in unsold inventory. The median amount of cash and other readily available assets on an S&P 500 tech company’s books at year-end was enough to let it operate about 270 days in an extreme scenario without revenue or cost cutting, while the median was closer to 60 days for retailers, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis. As companies prepare to close their books on a tumultuous first quarter, these measures can reveal how well-prepared they are for the sudden financial stress. Economists expect the crisis to cost the U.S. economy as much as $1.5 trillion in lost output over five years, including a decline in gross domestic product of 4% to 10% in the second quarter, a recent Journal survey of economists found.

And how can they stay sane during it all? We talked to pediatricians, educators and child psychologists to get their advice on everything from daily schedules and screen time to how best to motivate kids to do their online schoolwork. Here’s what they said: Yes, your child does need some sort of schedule. No, it doesn’t have to look like the typical school day. Ambitious, color-coded schedules that divide the day into 45-minute blocks filled with productive activities have proliferated on social media. But such a rigorous schedule may just set families up for failure, says Roberta Lenger Kang, director of the Center for the Professional Development of Teachers at Teachers College, Columbia University. Take time to figure out what works for your family. Dr. Lenger Kang, who lives in New York City, has important online meetings in the morning and needs to be quickly responding to emails then. So her three children, ages 4, 6 and 13, spend their mornings going on walks with their father, playing with Legos and having screen time. After lunch, she helps them with their school work. “Think about the learning. That is the important thing, not the timing,” she says. Still, kids do need a structure, says Rebecca Rialon Berry, clinical associate professor of child and adolescent psychiatry at NYU Langone Health. “Children thrive on routine, which can help them feel safe, regulated and calm,” she says. So, neither kids nor parents should lounge in their PJ’s all day (no matter how tempting that may be). In the morning, children should do their typical getting-ready-for-school routine, such as brushing teeth, making beds and dressing in what they’d usually wear to school, Dr. Rialon Berry says. Keep bedtimes and wake times relatively consistent. Daily physical activity is important, too: Take time for “recess” outside or an indoor dance party. And give children a say in their schedules. You’ll get more buy-in that way, she says. It can be helpful to define the beginning of the school day in a physical way, such as going for a walk, says Mary Alvord, a psychologist in Chevy Chase, Md. That can provide at least some psychological separation between “home” and “school.” Be creative—and try virtual help—to motivate kids to do their schoolwork. As any parent who has dealt with evening homework tussles knows, it can sometimes be tough to get kids to complete their assignments. And now there’s a whole lot more schoolwork that parents are on the hook to supervise. What activities and websites do you recommend for keeping children engaged? Join the conversation below. Opt for “positive reinforcement over negative corrections,” advises Dr. Lenger Kang. For younger kids, under age 8 or so, “giving out high-fives” can be enough. The reward of a snack or screen time after a certain amount of schoolwork can also motivate kids, she says. Dr. Alvord suggests hiring high-school or college students (who likely have a lot more time on their hands now) as virtual tutors for an hour or so a day to supervise schoolwork. “It is a way to change the dynamic,” she says. Children will think “it is kind of cool” to spend time with an older student and will more likely get their work done without a struggle. It can also ratchet down tension within the family. Parents must agree about who is “on.” While middle- and high-school students may be relatively self-sufficient during their at-home school day, especially as more school districts get their curricula up and running, most elementary-schoolers and younger children will need a parent to supervise. Parents must work out who does what and when—but not in front of the children. Divvying up household responsibilities can cause conflict in the best of times. When both parents are working from home, “there can be a lot of conflict around whose job is more important, who has a deadline,” says Paul Donahue, a child psychologist in Scarsdale, N.Y. “As much as possible, we want to iron out those [issues and responsibilities] outside of earshot of the kids,” he says. “Each person has to make sacrifices.” Screen-time rules can be relaxed. A lot. Pediatrician Dimitri Christakis is a lead author of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ media guidelines for young children, which recommend that preschoolers (ages 2 to 5) “limit screen use to one hour per day of high-quality programs.” But even he says those recommendations are unrealistic in the current reality when many parents are working from home without child care. “The guidelines were never issued with the apocalypse in mind,” he says. Instead, he recommends parents limit preschoolers’ screen time to four hours a day. “Of all the age groups, preschool has a fair amount of high-quality educational programming,” says Dr. Christakis, who is also the director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development at Seattle Children’s Research Institute. He suggests that parents use guides like those from Common Sense Media, a nonprofit that recommends age-appropriate entertainment, to choose content and talk to children about what they have seen and learned. For elementary-schoolers, Dr. Christakis suggests limiting recreational screen time (not including what’s necessary for online learning) to three hours a day. “Given parental needs in this situation, we should be willing to be fairly lax about these things,” he says. For middle school and high school, Dr. Christakis says to make sure tweens and teens are spending at least four hours a day away from screens (not including sleep time). There should be no screen time during meals, and for at least one hour before bedtime. Kids still need a social life. Between social media and multiplayer gaming, older children and teens tend to have a lot of experience connecting with their friends digitally. But younger children need to spend time with their friends in this new world, too. “Young people really rely on social connections. Not having it, over time, can have an effect on mood and self-esteem,” says Dr. Rialon Berry. Parents can arrange virtual playdates using Google Hangouts or Zoom. Dr. Lenger Kang is helping her 13-year-old son set up an online Dungeons & Dragons club with his friends. Dr. Donahue, the child psychologist, says responsible teens also could take walks together—as long as they stay 6 feet apart, as public-health officials recommend. Some time alone is good, too. Kids, especially teens, still need some physical and psychological space. With families suddenly spending so much time together, a spike in squabbles is probably inevitable, especially among siblings. It is important for each child to spend some time alone to decompress, says Dr. Rialon Berry. For siblings who share a room, she suggests that each child gets at least 30 minutes a day in their room alone to do what they want. Many teenagers are used to a certain amount of physical freedom. They may have had cars, jobs and liberal curfews. Now, they might be chafing at new rules and saddened by their loss of freedom. “We have to recognize that they, too, are experiencing stress and strain,” says Nathaniel Beers, a pediatrician at Children’s National Hospital in Washington, D.C. Parents should give them privacy to connect with their friends and “vent to their community,” he says. Brad Sachs, a family psychologist in Columbia, Md., says parents can help teens who are “rattling the cage for more independence” by encouraging their social consciousness and sense of altruism. Suggest that they offer to pick up groceries for a senior, or that they communicate with an isolated family member through FaceTime. Says Dr. Sachs, “Those concrete actions tend to take the edge off that loss of autonomy.” Ms. Petersen is a reporter for The Wall Street Journal in New York.

Such a shift may not happen immediately after the 15-day period ends, an administration official said, adding that the White House is operating with a “high degree of caution.” President Trump said Monday evening at a White House briefing that his administration would make a decision on what he called the “opening of our country” once the 15-day period ends. He declined to be more specific, but said it would happen “a lot sooner than the three to four months that somebody was suggesting.” Also at Monday’s press conference, Attorney General William Barr said the Justice Department would take action against those who hoarded protective equipment and other items to sell at high prices. Meanwhile, governments in other parts of the world stepped up efforts to slow the spread of the coronavirus, as cases surged past 367,000 Monday and the number of deaths surpassed 16,000.

The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy on Sunday announced the Covid-19 High Performance Computing Consortium, a partnership that includes IBM, the Energy Department national laboratories,            Alphabet Inc.’s      Google Cloud,            Amazon.com Inc.’s      Amazon Web Services,            Microsoft Corp.      and others. Researchers from academia, government and the private sector will be able to submit coronavirus-related projects through a website beginning Sunday. Representatives from the consortium with backgrounds in areas such as high-performance computing, biology and epidemiology will approve the projects based on merit and the path to fastest impact, said            Dario Gil,      director of IBM Research. The goal is to grant researchers access to powerful computing resources days after they submit their projects. The announcement comes as health-care and government officials have criticized key parts of Washington’s response to the crisis, both in providing testing and helping secure medical supplies for hospitals. “Ultimately, we need a cure. To be able to tackle that, we need to accelerate science,” Mr. Gil said. “We do have an extreme sense of urgency.” The machines to which researchers will have free, remote access include two of the world’s most powerful supercomputers from IBM: Summit, at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and Lassen, at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Combined, the 16 supercomputing systems that will be available to researchers at the start of the program represent over 265 petaflops of computing capacity, 775,000 computer processing unit cores, and over 34,000 graphics processing units, Mr. Gil said. The machines were built by companies including IBM and others. Supercomputers are used to tackle computational problems in initiatives such as drug discovery, materials development and battery design.  Such problems are complex and time-consuming to complete for standard computers. Predicting positive and negative effects of specific drugs, for example, is a computationally complex problem because it requires simulating the structure of molecules and their chemical features. Supercomputers have thousands or tens of thousands of processors that coordinate and work together to perform large calculations, Mr. Gil said. Supercomputers are also particularly well-suited for processing and analyzing large amounts of data using artificial-intelligence algorithms, Mr. Gil said. Researchers at the Energy Department’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the University of Tennessee recently used the IBM Summit supercomputer to run simulations on more than 8,000 compounds and identified 77 small molecules that could be used to accelerate the discovery of new therapies and vaccines for the coronavirus, said            Paul Dabbar,      undersecretary for science at the department. Government officials began conversations with IBM about the initiative on March 18, said            Michael Kratsios,      the U.S. chief technology officer. Earlier last week, researchers released a vast data set for AI experts to mine. It contains more than 29,000 articles of scholarly literature about Covid-19 and related viruses. Since that data set was put out, it has been downloaded over 18,000 times by researchers who want to use AI algorithms to mine for insights, according to a White House official. “Something we’ve seen as this pandemic has taken hold is the entire research community is ready, willing and eager to help assist the American people in this time of crisis,” Mr. Kratsios said. Technology companies have also made other high-performance computing resources available for free to teams working to develop test kits and vaccines for Covid-19. Microsoft and enterprise-technology firm Rescale Inc. announced such a program Thursday, while Amazon Web Services on Friday announced a $20 million initiative to accelerate Covid-19 diagnostic research.

S. and European leaders are looking at China’s progress in curbing the coronavirus pandemic to guide them on how to beat the virus within their own borders. They may be drawing the wrong lessons, doctors and health experts say. The cordon sanitaire that began around Wuhan and two nearby cities on Jan. 23 helped slow the virus’s transmission to other parts of China, but didn’t really stop it in Wuhan itself, these experts say. Instead, the virus kept spreading among family members in homes, in large part because hospitals were too overwhelmed to handle all the patients, according to doctors and patients there. What really turned the tide in Wuhan was a shift after Feb. 2 to a more aggressive and systematic quarantine regime whereby suspected or mild cases—and even healthy close contacts of confirmed cases—were sent to makeshift hospitals and temporary quarantine centers. The tactics required turning hundreds of hotels, schools and other places into quarantine centers, as well as building two new hospitals and creating 14 temporary ones in public buildings. It also underscored the importance of coronavirus testing capacity, which local authorities say was expanded from 200 tests a day in late January to 7,000 daily by mid-February.  "

Mr. Trump on Friday invoked the Defense Production Act, or DPA, which dates back to the Korean War and gives the president powers to require businesses to produce goods tied to national defense. For weeks he had said that the threat of invoking the DPA was sufficient. Previously he likened using the DPA to nationalizing American business. He reversed course Friday, saying GM was “wasting time” in negotiations with the federal government. With the number of confirmed cases of Covid-19—the disease caused by the new coronavirus—topping 100,000 in the U.S. on Friday, worries about a ventilator shortage have grown all the more urgent. GM was already working toward wide-scale ventilator production through a collaboration struck last week with medical-device firm Ventec Life Systems. On Friday, the Detroit auto maker said, “Ventec, GM and our supply base have been working around the clock for weeks to meet this urgent need.”  "

That ended this month with the attack of the coronavirus and Thursday’s record spike of three million new jobless claims. Millions more will follow in the coming weeks, and the goal of public policy should be to get them back to work as soon as possible—not to keep them on the government’s unemployment tab. That point may seem obvious but you wouldn’t know it from this week’s flap over the enhanced jobless benefits in the Senate’s $2 trillion coronavirus relief bill. The bill increases unemployment benefits for all workers by $600 per week for the next four months. Even the liberal Economic Policy Institute says this expansion would provide a “100% replacement of wage income for the bottom half of the workforce.” Some will earn more by not working. Republican Senators Ben Sasse, Lindsey Graham, Tim Scott and Rick Scott warned that this might hurt small employers in their states by encouraging workers to stay at home for longer. Speaker Nancy Pelosi called them “cruel”—the word is her version of Donald Trump’s “incredible”—and the media echoed her. The Senators are right if you know anything about labor markets and incentives to work. Jobless benefits are administered by the states, each of which sets its own eligibility requirements and payment levels. Benefits are typically based on a worker’s prior earnings and limited to between 50% and 70% of a state’s average weekly wage. The maximum benefit runs up to $823 in Massachusetts while the minimum is as low as $10 in Louisiana for low-earners. The current economic crisis is like no other because government has literally forced hundreds of thousands of businesses to shut down. And because so many workers are likely to lose their jobs, more generous benefits will cushion the short-term blow. But the goal should be returning people to private payrolls when the crisis passes, and the risk is that benefits at 100% of wages for the long term will do the opposite and slow the recovery.  "

The goal is to keep people with symptoms at home and to practice social distancing if their condition doesn’t warrant more intensive hospital care. Almost 80% of hospitals in the U.S. have some sort of telehealth service. Have you called a telemedicine service? What was your experience? Join the conversation below. The new emphasis is designed to free up doctors and other front-line providers by encouraging patients with unrelated ailments such as diabetes to get care online. Here’s what people should know: How does telehealth work? Technology such as email, videoconferencing, video chat services such as Skype and phone enable patients to get care remotely. Responses from health-care professionals can either be provided in real time, for instance via webcam, or by directing individuals’ questions to answers that are already online. How do I get an appointment or find a remote provider? Check your provider’s website or check with your health insurer on how to access telehealth services. Individuals can also go directly to sites from            Teladoc Health,      Amwell, PlushCare, Doctor on Demand and MD Live for virtual visits, but note that some of these sites are warning consumers that they may experience longer wait times due to high demand. What does it cost? That depends. Insurance plans may cover telehealth if it is provided directly by a doctor or hospital, or through a telehealth service, although consumers might have a copay or other out-of-pocket charge. Under a recent change, Medicare will cover telehealth services and Medicare Advantage plans may waive or reduce cost sharing. People can pay directly out of pocket for the entire cost of a direct-to-consumer visit and prices vary. Some cost about $50 to $80 a visit; there may be an annual membership fee. How secure is telehealth? Privacy and security varies. During the coronavirus crisis, the Trump administration has waived some enforcement of a federal law that protects patient privacy if providers are operating in good faith. Still, some services such as Skype can put security at risk, experts say. Consumers can ask telehealth providers about security features such as encrypted data transmission.  Can telehealth providers write prescriptions? Doctors can send prescriptions directly to a local pharmacy via telehealth. Providers can’t test individuals for coronavirus but they can help identify who may need to seek a test. Services may use doctors or practitioners who they employ or who are on contract. More state medical boards are implementing telemedicine-related standards for practitioners. Can telehealth providers treat the coronavirus? Health-care providers can’t diagnose a coronavirus infection during a telehealth visit, but they can offer self-care and quarantine tips, educate patients about when they need to go to a hospital, and if they do, help to coordinate testing, according to the American Telemedicine Association. I’m a health-care provider and want to offer telehealth in my practice. Where do I start? The American Medical Association created a quick guide to support physicians and practices in expediting the implementation of telehealth.

Many school closures are likely to last through the end of this school year, and more may be needed in the fall if the virus’s spread picks up then. These shutdowns have created a range of dire short-term problems, including inconsistent access to home internet and the disruption of essential meal programs and child care for working parents. In the long term, they may bring about profound changes in how we school our children. In the coming year, students and teachers may need to break down barriers between in-person and at-home schooling, and be ready to shift from one to the other with little notice. It may be a deeply challenging period for families and educators. A constant uncertainty about when school will be in session could force a re-evaluation of the traditional methods we use to pace students and track progress. “Seat time,” a term to measure the duration of classroom instruction, won’t seem sufficient when seats may be in different places and times. The idea of individual pacing and mastery of subjects may become mainstream, because they’ll be a necessity. Teachers have always known that kids learn at different speeds and that debilitating gaps can form when students are pushed forward at one fixed pace. But historically, it has been a struggle to personalize learning for each student. Over the past decade, online tools have started to be leveraged in classrooms to address this need. They’ve allowed students to work on what they are ready for and to have as many chances as needed to master concepts. Decades of research on such “mastery learning” shows that it works. If it becomes mainstream inside and outside classrooms because of school closures, it has a chance to accelerate student learning. But children can’t learn online if they can’t get online. The disruption of the school year will be particularly difficult for students who are underserved. They need the schoolhouse to provide what they otherwise lack, from access to technology to food and in some cases shelter. Online access has gone from nice-to-have to must-have in a time of social distancing. This is not just for giving families access to online learning but also for their mental health so that they can stay connected to friends and family. Without universal access, the gap between rich and poor students will become even more exaggerated, a development that we must not allow. Government and private industry must step up to help school districts equip every student for distance learning as soon as possible.  "

We asked doctors at top hospitals all over the country what they would include in their ideal Covid-19 home-care kit. We gathered their best suggestions and advice to help you organize your own.

A cellist uploaded his tender rendition of J.S. Bach’s Allemande in G Major to calm down his  Facebook  friends. During the Covid-19 pandemic, such social media projects are attempted workarounds to social distancing, along with more traditional methods like calling old friends and chatting with neighbors from opposite sides of the street. The question is, what works? How do we get our basic social needs met during a pandemic? Answers are starting to surface from the field of social neuroscience, which uses brain imaging and biological measures like the hormones circulating in our bloodstreams to track how physical states like isolation affect our brains, and vice versa—how our moods and social situations affect our physical resilience. Evidence shows that social interaction is a biological requirement, much like eating, drinking and sleeping. Our ability to learn to talk, play, acquire new skills, fall in love, conduct business, and age in good health all hinge on our motivation to connect with other people, social neuroscientists have found. So while social distancing reduces transmission of the coronavirus, which is good for us, it also increases anxiety, frustration and loneliness, which is bad for us. Even before Covid-19 forced us to self-isolate, a quarter of Americans were chronically lonely—a psychological state that is invisible, contagious and physically damaging, much like the virus itself. Animals that have been forcibly isolated show enduring changes in their brains and behavior, including ramped-up aggression in males, anxiety, depression, decreased immunity to infection, and a heightened desire for alcohol, food and morphine. It’s as if the craving for others’ company is suddenly replaced by a biological drive for more immediate and risky rewards, a trade-off also seen in humans. A new survey of 24 studies on the psychological impact of previous quarantines, recently published in the journal The Lancet, shows that human adults who were quarantined due to SARS, H1N1 and Ebola show many of the same reactions: more fear, more alcohol and substance abuse, and more post-quarantine resistance to in-person contact—a “back off” feeling more common among health care workers.

In the areas worst hit by the pandemic, Italy is undercounting thousands of deaths caused by the virus, a Wall Street Journal analysis shows, indicating that the pandemic’s human toll may end up being much greater, and infections far more widespread, than official data indicate. Italy’s hidden death toll shows what could lie in store for the worst-hit areas of the U.S., Europe and many other countries in the weeks ahead if the coronavirus is not tamed fast. The burden that the pandemic puts on health-care systems can cause so many deaths that it is hard to gauge the full human cost. As stretched and sometimes overwhelmed hospitals fight to save their patients, many other people die unseen and uncounted, including elderly people in out-of-the-way locations. In addition, the health-care crisis can lead to a surge of deaths from other causes that would normally be treatable.  "

How many employees can they afford to keep on the payroll? Can they get a break on rent? The decisions they make this week could shape how deeply the economy is damaged by the coronavirus pandemic. “Rent is due. Utilities are due. Credit card bills are due April 1,” said Hadley Douglas, who has laid off two workers from her liquor business, The Urban Grape. “The deadline is looming large and it is petrifying.” She said her landlord turned down a request to temporarily pay half the rent but said to keep in touch as it was focusing first on smaller, harder hit businesses.

A record 3.28 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits in the week ended March 21. The U.S. restaurant industry has lost $25 billion in sales since March 1, according to a survey of 5,000 owners by the National Restaurant Association.

Amid a pandemic that has sickened thousands in the U.S., many hospitals and doctors are grappling with an unexpected side effect: a financial squeeze that could deplete the health-care resources needed to meet local surges in cases and threatens the operations of some financially struggling hospitals. Coronavirus patients are overwhelming hospitals in cities including New York, New Orleans and Detroit. As others brace for similar spikes, they are also seeing sharp drop-offs in regular doctor visits, emergency-room arrivals and the lucrative surgeries that are vital to most hospitals’ bottom lines. Hospitals are burning through cash even as nonprofit operators have seen their reserves in investment portfolios dented, spurring credit agencies to put the sector on a negative outlook—despite an expected influx of money from a newly passed federal aid package. “There’s this waiting period for the wave to hit that a lot of hospitals aren’t prepared to weather,” said Chas Roades, chief executive of Gist Healthcare, a consulting firm. “Because the revenue has gone way down, they’re having to cut expenses in a way that might make them less prepared when the wave does hit.”  "

In 48 years of rooting for Bergamo’s local professional soccer team, a modest outfit called Atalanta, neither Mr. Pontiggia nor his hometown had ever seen anything like it. Atalanta was somehow the Cinderella of European soccer, and now it had a date in the sport’s most prestigious tournament, the Champions League. The match had even been moved to Milan for the occasion. The stadium, San Siro, had enough room in the stands for twice as many Bergamaschi as Atalanta’s home park, and the Italian fans intended to cram into every available seat. None of them had yet heard the words social distancing. “Everything was crowded. The roads, all the surroundings, the stadium,” said Mr. Pontiggia, 55, who took nearly three hours to complete the 35-mile drive to the San Siro. “It was practically a whole town moving to Milan.

Now, as in late 1944, there is a sense of inchoate danger, aimed not at any particular person, but striking randomly and with devastation. But there is an important difference between that faraway time and ours. American endurance then was fortified by an ultimate national purpose. Now, in a divided country, efficient and farsighted government is necessary to overcome obstacles unprecedented in magnitude and global scope. Sustaining the public trust is crucial to social solidarity, to the relation of societies with each other, and to international peace and stability. Nations cohere and flourish on the belief that their institutions can foresee calamity, arrest its impact and restore stability. When the Covid-19 pandemic is over, many countries’ institutions will be perceived as having failed. Whether this judgment is objectively fair is irrelevant. The reality is the world will never be the same after the coronavirus. To argue now about the past only makes it harder to do what has to be done. The coronavirus has struck with unprecedented scale and ferocity. Its spread is exponential: U.S. cases are doubling every fifth day. At this writing, there is no cure. Medical supplies are insufficient to cope with the widening waves of cases. Intensive-care units are on the verge, and beyond, of being overwhelmed. Testing is inadequate to the task of identifying the extent of infection, much less reversing its spread. A successful vaccine could be 12 to 18 months away. The U.S. administration has done a solid job in avoiding immediate catastrophe. The ultimate test will be whether the virus’s spread can be arrested and then reversed in a manner and at a scale that maintains public confidence in Americans’ ability to govern themselves. The crisis effort, however vast and necessary, must not crowd out the urgent task of launching a parallel enterprise for the transition to the post-coronavirus order. Leaders are dealing with the crisis on a largely national basis, but the virus’s society-dissolving effects do not recognize borders. While the assault on human health will—hopefully—be temporary, the political and economic upheaval it has unleashed could last for generations. No country, not even the U.S., can in a purely national effort overcome the virus. Addressing the necessities of the moment must ultimately be coupled with a global collaborative vision and program. If we cannot do both in tandem, we will face the worst of each.  "

A few days later, he tested negative at a second lab. The chief medical officer at the practice where the tests were ordered is betting that the positive result is the right one. “A false negative is problematic because it tells the patient they don’t have the virus,” said the doctor, Craig Deligdish, an oncologist at Omni Healthcare, a Melbourne, Fla., medical group. Meanwhile, that patient can unwittingly spread it, he said. Health experts say they now believe nearly one in three patients who are infected are nevertheless getting a negative test result. They caution that only limited data is available, and their estimates are based on their own experience in the absence of hard science. That picture is troubling, many doctors say, as it casts doubt on the reliability of a wave of new tests developed by manufacturers, lab companies and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most of these are operating with minimal regulatory oversight and little time to do robust studies amid a desperate call for wider testing.  "

Mr. Trump, appearing at the briefing with two of his top medical advisers, repeatedly urged Americans to follow federal social-distancing guidelines, which have now been extended through the end of April. “We’ve got to brace ourselves,” said            Dr. Anthony Fauci,      a member of the White House coronavirus task force. But Dr. Fauci said that continued protective social-distancing measures could help prevent the worst-case scenario. “In the next several days to a week or so, we’re going to continue to see things go up,” Dr. Fauci said. “We cannot be discouraged by that. Because the mitigation is actually working, and will work.” The U.S. has more confirmed cases than any other country, with more than 189,000 infections, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The death toll, now greater than China’s, passed 4,000. That is still far less than Italy, where fatalities rose to 12,428 Tuesday, or Spain, which has reported 8,464 deaths. Projections from the University of Washington show the illness could result in nearly 84,000 deaths in the U.S. by early August, with 2,214 deaths a day at the nation’s peak in two weeks. Nearly half of the 50 states have now reported more than 1,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19, the respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus. And much of America is expected to experience extended closures of schools, offices, restaurants and other venues as concerns about a coming surge in patients have pushed mayors and governors to take steps unprecedented in modern times to fight the contagion. State leaders have extended, and in some cases expanded, stay-at-home orders late into the spring or indefinitely, while the Trump administration lengthened its social-distancing guidelines through April 30. The apex of the pandemic is expected to occur sooner in New York, the hardest-hit state with 75,795 confirmed cases and 1,550 deaths. “We underestimated this virus,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday. “It’s more powerful, it’s more dangerous than we expected.” Mr. Cuomo said the state was still working to expand hospital capacity and support health-care workers as the growing number of patients becomes more difficult to manage. On Monday, a U.S. Navy hospital ship docked in Manhattan and the Javits Center opened its doors as a makeshift site. Emergency management officials also plan to add 350 hospital beds at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Queens. Existing hospitals had already reached their tipping point, straining the health-care system and its workers. “They are physically exhausted,” Mr. Cuomo said of health-care professionals. “Even more, they are emotionally exhausted.” State officials across the U.S. are working to acquire needed medical supplies, increase hospital capacity by turning arenas and other facilities into temporary hospital wards, and recruit health-care workers. Thousands of retired and inactive doctors and nurses are returning to the field to help. Michigan leaders designated the TCF Center in Detroit as a field hospital, repurposing the venue, which was slated to hold the city’s North American International Auto Show in June. Confirmed cases in the state rose Tuesday to 6,505 from 1,329 a week ago. There have been 2,086 cases and 73 deaths in Detroit so far. In an effort to protect front-line workers grappling with shortages, hospitals and research groups are racing to roll out new ways to reuse face masks safely.            General Motors Co.      said masks it is making for workers responding to the coronavirus will be available for delivery next week. GM is among the manufacturers and medical-device giants also gearing up to boost production of ventilators. Russian President      Vladimir Putin            offered Mr. Trump medical aid and equipment during a phone call Monday, according to the official Russian news agency TASS. A plane carrying the products was “expected to fly [to the U.S.] before the end of this day,” the agency quoted Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying. The Kremlin leader offered the help on the assumption that U.S. medical suppliers could, if necessary, return the favor once they reach production capacity, TASS cited Mr. Peskov as saying.

With much of the U.S. and global economy shut down, U.S. stocks ended their worst quarter since the financial crisis. Mr. Trump called Tuesday for a possible fourth congressional coronavirus relief package to include significant investment in infrastructure, citing an opportunity in low interest rates. Congress has already passed three major pieces of legislation to address the pandemic. Globally, the number of confirmed cases of the virus has passed 858,000, according to Johns Hopkins data. The death toll rose to more than 42,000 on Tuesday. More than 178,000 people world-wide have recovered. In March alone, the number of reported coronavirus infections world-wide jumped nearly nine times from 86,000 confirmed cases on the last day of February, while fatalities surged more than 10-fold, Johns Hopkins data showed. Testing for the deadly virus, however, hasn’t been uniform across America or globally, making accurate case counts hard to pin down. Underscoring the difficulties of capturing the extent of the pandemic, China said more than 1,500 people who were infected with the virus but haven’t shown symptoms weren’t included in its national tally of confirmed cases. The National Health Commission said it had asked hospitals to report asymptomatic cases and had asked local officials to place them and their close contacts under two-week quarantine. It couldn’t be learned to what degree that was done. Chang Jile, a top Chinese health official, said the country would report the number of infected people who aren’t showing symptoms beginning Wednesday. Scientists don’t have a consensus on the impact of asymptomatic cases. Italian scientists tracing almost 6,000 infections around Lombardy, for instance, found nasal swabs of asymptomatic carriers had similar amounts of virus as those with symptoms, which could make them as contagious, according to a prepublication draft of their research. But they also said the small number of asymptomatic cases turned up in contact tracing may mean such carriers played a limited role in spreading the virus. Many governments around the world are extending closures and other social-distancing measures to hinder the spread of the disease, while others are weighing a relaxation of restrictions in order to mitigate the impact on their economies. Canada’s largest city, Toronto, ordered all public events and large gatherings banned until June 30. “These events sometimes involve thousands of people, and it is doubtful that the health environment will be where it needs to be on the originally scheduled spring dates,” John Tory, Toronto’s mayor, said at a briefing Tuesday afternoon. Russia’s parliament voted to stiffen penalties for violating coronavirus-related restrictions. Failure to abide by lockdown rules and inadvertently causing the deaths of two or more people would be punishable by up to seven years in prison, according to the legislation. Anyone infected with coronavirus who violates quarantine restrictions and causes “mass illness” would be fined up to $12,820. In Denmark, Prime Minister            Mette Frederiksen      said a nationwide lockdown imposed March 11 was showing signs of success and could be eased starting in mid-April if Danes stick to the rules. The country has closed its border to noncitizens; shut restaurants, pubs, shopping malls and schools; and banned gatherings of more than 10 people. In Iran, whose death toll reached 2,898, President            Hassan Rouhani      said most provinces had the virus relatively under control, but that two or three provinces were having more difficulty. China is moving more quickly to open up. It has pushed to resume activities that were stalled nationwide since the end of January, reopening factories, malls and other public amenities as new cases of infection slowed sharply in recent weeks. On Tuesday, an official gauge of Chinese manufacturing activity showed a strong rebound in March, reflecting the resumption of work in many industries, though economists said business activity is still far from normal.

Welcome to Sweden, the last holdout among the small number of Western countries to have taken a radically different approach to the coronavirus pandemic. While social life in Europe and much of the U.S. now centers on the home after governments imposed increasingly drastic curbs on freedom of movement, Sweden left offices and stores open, issued recommendations rather than restrictions, and waited to see what happens. Businesses, kindergartens and schools remain open. After a long winter, Stockholm’s street cafes and outdoor bars swelled with people over the weekend, and the city’s old town drew large crowds as locals ventured out to enjoy the good weather. The only mandatory rules are a ban on meetings of more than 50 people and an order forcing bars and restaurants to only serve seated customers so as to avoid overcrowding. The U.K. and the Netherlands also briefly considered letting the virus propagate through the population in a controlled manner so as to build a natural form of immunity. Both reversed course after academics warned they could face hundreds of thousands of deaths and an overwhelmed health care system.  "

The questions poured in: How do I tell someone that mechanical ventilation may not be effective? How do I tell people that they may die? The inquiries reflect the need for clinicians to have empathetic conversations with patients and families about the prospects for survival, the goals of treatment, and how to comfort or say goodbye to loved ones in isolation. Such services are especially vital, some hospital leaders say, because coronavirus patients are treated away from family or other support systems. Specialists known as palliative-care clinicians say they are working 16-hour days in the weeks since the pandemic crisis began to ease suffering and ensure treatments match patients’ goals in areas hit hard by the virus. Palliative-care providers are also rushing to get practice scripts, role-playing videos and information cards to doctors and nurses to help guide their conversations with people seriously ill from the virus. “It’s bad, there’s no getting around it,” said Dr. Sean Morrison, who heads the geriatric and palliative medicine department at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. “We have the ability to make it easier. ICU doctors and emergency physicians are having very difficult conversations with families and sometimes patients.”  "

Many bricks-and-mortar retailers, which had seen falling foot traffic for years due to online competition, have now shuttered their stores while online merchants watch sales boom. And sectors that had long resisted the move online are now joining in: Doctors and therapists offer telemedicine appointments while their offices sit nearly empty; yoga studios and other fitness providers are offering remote sessions; schools and universities have moved classes online.

While the coronavirus pandemic is driving reader traffic to news sites, the crisis is delivering a punishing blow to already-struggling local publishers hit by declining advertising revenue.  "

With coronavirus spreading, the bank had told the staff in its stock-trading operation to head to three separate sites around New York City. Hours before the workday began, with global markets plunging, technology at the sites wasn’t ready. JPMorgan top brass reversed the order and told many traders to report for duty, as usual, to the firm’s Manhattan headquarters, employees said. An employee who wasn’t feeling well came to the office. JPMorgan traded more shares that Monday than any day in the bank’s history. The sick employee turned out to have Covid-19, and over the past three weeks, about 20 employees on a single floor at the bank’s headquarters have tested positive for the virus, with another 65 quarantined as a result. Wall Street is used to making tough choices in seconds, but the coronavirus pandemic has added a dimension of life or death. Amid the wildest trading conditions in more than a decade, banks are loath to fully allow the thousands of traders and salespeople who keep the markets humming to work from home. Setups in home offices lack the multibillion-dollar technology infrastructure of the trading floor. Even slight delays in speed could cost money. Wall Street trading has been deemed an “essential service” by New York authorities, and though the New York Stock Exchange has shut its floor, the major banks continue to have some employees report to work.

Before the outbreak, telemedicine struggled to take hold, in part because of government regulation and a lack of interest from patients and big companies. Now, companies like  Teladoc Health Inc.  and Doctor on Demand Inc. are racing to add doctors and bandwidth, while big tech firms like  Microsoft Corp.  add services. Whether the flurry is a short-term response to the crisis, or a more lasting shift in health care is still unknown. The largest stand-alone telemedicine service in the U.S., publicly traded Teladoc, has been slammed with calls. The Purchase, N.Y., company reported a 50% increase in service through March 20 compared with the week prior. It provides video consultations with a network of thousands of doctors through its app, charging subscription fees to insurers and large employers. It also offers individual consultations. Jennifer Fritz-Crist, a 34-year-old in Dallas, said she waited 22 hours to hold a video call with a Teladoc provider last month, before her appointment ultimately was canceled. She had recently been in the emergency room with pneumonia and wanted to renew a prescription. When Ms. Fritz-Crist tried another large telemedicine firm, Doctor on Demand, based in San Francisco, she couldn’t register because the site’s online “waiting room” was full.  "

Many customers who call the hotlines of airlines, retailers and financial-services firms, among others, encounter hourslong wait times, hearing recorded messages saying help is currently unavailable. Some companies ask that customers manage their issues online or suggest that they hold off on seeking  assistance altogether. Over the past three decades, companies' call centers and customer-help centers have shifted overseas and are now concentrated in regions of the world hard hit by the new coronavirus. Meantime, customer-service setups in the U.S., often densely packed with employees, are either shutting down or downsizing amid containment efforts. Companies trying to set up employees to work from home, both in the U.S. and abroad, have to figure out how to ensure secure networks and phone lines in an age where cybersecurity is vital. Some of the most-needed services, such as banking and health-care, involve especially sensitive information. Businesses are scrambling for temp workers and using bots to help filter callers who need a live person from those who can be helped in other ways. “At every company…all the call-center folks are getting an email from the CEO saying, ’What’s the plan if I have to vacate’” workers from the office, said Pat Gibbons, marketing chief for customer-service consulting firm Walker Information Inc. Mr. Gibbons said he had stopped taking on new clients to free up resources for existing ones. What has been your experience during the pandemic trying to reach customer service? Join the conversation below. So far, human contact is in short supply. The            American Express Co.      login page is topped with a message, in red letters, warning of long wait times and encouraging people to “use our digital tools.”            British Airways      ’ customer-service line to manage flight reservations has played a message to call back later or visit the company’s website. Calling the toll-free number for            Procter & Gamble Co.      ’s Charmin brand toilet paper tells people looking for bathroom tissue that the company is working “as fast as humanly possible” to supply retailers and ends with, “We hope you are able to find it in stores soon,” before disconnecting. “You have these big rooms with 1,000 people sitting a foot and a half from each other, and the moment something like [Covid-19] pops out, you’ve got to thin them out,” said            Rick Bloom,      CEO of Support.com, a Sunnyvale, Calif., firm that provides customer-service software and staff for companies who outsource and is hiring hundreds of workers to keep up with demand. Internet providers face an influx of demand as American workers and school children shift to working and learning online, respectively. Airlines, which are sustaining losses as flights are grounded world-wide, are being inundated with calls from customers needing flight changes, refunds or help getting home. Javon Johnson, a professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, recently drove to the airport to speak to a            United Airlines Holdings Inc.’s      customer-service agent in person after efforts to recover $2,000 spent on canceled flights proved fruitless. United’s call volumes initially doubled amid the coronavirus spread, a company spokeswoman said. The company enlisted employees from across its business, including senior executives, to take customer calls. Call volume has since declined, she said, while call wait times have almost returned to normal. Companies that equip call centers with technical infrastructure and cloud services say the deluge of calls to consumer-facing businesses began with travelers and has shifted to consumers calling makers of in-demand products such as toilet paper and diapers, investors calling financial institutions, and patients calling health systems and insurers, among others. “The needs of how to deal with that needed to be massively reconfigured in real time,” said            Jeff Lawson,      chief executive of cloud-communications company Twilio Inc. “There was the trickle, and then there was the wave, and then there was a tsunami.” American companies employ roughly 2.9 million customer-service workers, up 30% from a decade earlier, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Data are lacking on how many U.S. jobs have been shifted overseas. Many of the biggest U.S. corporations, from            Target Corp.      to American Express, have operations in either or both the Philippines and India, which  are the largest providers of call-center work to American companies. The Philippines has outpaced India, with more than one million call-center workers and continues to grow, according to the IT & Business Process Association of the Philippines. Both nations have been affected by the coronavirus spread. India ordered a complete lockdown Tuesday of its 1.3 billion citizens. Earlier this month, police and army troops worked to seal off the Philippine capital of Manila and the surrounding area, home to more than 12 million people. Where working from home in the U.S. can be glitchy and frustrating for call-center workers, it is impossible for many overseas, analysts say. Workers are often poor and lack laptops or internet connections. In the Philippines, containment efforts aren’t uniform across regions so workers face varying challenges, from blocked-off roadways to stay-at-home mandates. Further complicating matters: Call centers are sometimes technological holdouts, with many still reliant on traditional on-premises, business-telephone systems, rather than portable, cloud-based services, said Gregg Johnson, chief executive of call-tracking and analytics firm Invoca. Many have long been centrally managed operations centers with little need to send workers elsewhere. To manage the traffic, some companies are creating bot-based answer systems that attempt to siphon off some calls to automated systems and place a priority on only those that require person-to-person interaction. In health care, the bot-based systems may use prompts to advise patients to stay home or give other treatment tips. More severe cases may be transmitted to a video consult, with only the most extreme cases escalating to an in-person hospital or doctor’s visit. At            Verizon Communications Inc.,      thousands of call-center agents were part of a normal work-from-home rotation before the pandemic, but trying to move the majority of them to remote workstations required new equipment, security measures and connectivity. Sending agents home requires computers formatted with adequate security and workflow systems as well as a broadband connection that can accommodate voice-over-internet calls and a headset. Nearly all of Verizon’s 17,000 call-center workers were working remotely by Friday, a spokesman said.

Most didn’t have masks or supplies to disinfect workstations, even as cleaning products streamed past them on conveyor belts. On some recent days, about half the workers hadn’t even shown up, she said. Her co-worker soon returned to his station, and Ms. Granados continued preparing packages, concerned but also mindful her work was likely essential for the millions of people who had turned to online shopping for groceries and thermometers. She never found out what was ailing him. “We’re playing a vital role to get people the supplies they need, whether it’s the elderly or people with health issues,” said Ms. Granados, who is 41 years old. “A lot of people are depending on us.” The coronavirus is pulling Amazon, America’s largest online retailer, in many directions.

With social distancing likely to extend through the spring semester, chief information officers are taking stock of their actions, identifying quick solutions that could one day become permanent fixtures on a postcrisis campus. “When we come out of this, I think it’ll be a great opportunity for the universities to look at how we use these tools...in new and creative ways,” said            Aaron Powell,      the Seattle university’s CIO. With Seattle an early U.S. epicenter of the coronavirus, the university began screening students for the virus by late January. Mr. Powell started testing remote-learning tools in February. The university moved around 45,000 students to online classes in early March. The university uses Panopto, a video-education platform, Zoom videoconferencing and Canvas, a cloud-based hub for remote-learning tools, communication, and course materials. “At this point, we’re stabilizing the usage and increasing the knowledge base across the campus of these tools. That’s the urgency today,” Mr. Powell said. “When there’s light at the end of the tunnel, we’ll start to look at new technologies, what’s available on the marketplace that might better meet [our] needs.” Medical students at the Cleveland university had been using            Microsoft Corp.’s      HoloLens in classes since last year as part of a partnership with the Cleveland Clinic, which helped build the school’s health-education campus. The wearable devices, which superimpose digital content including hologram-like images onto a user’s view of the real world, can be used to replace cadavers in anatomy classes.  Campus closures prompted CIO            Sue Workman      over two weeks ago to invest more in its augmented reality program. She shipped about 200 HoloLens units to students dispersed across the U.S. and Canada. Remote classes combine voice instruction with augmented reality: anatomical structures are displayed as holograms. The first class was successfully completed last month. There have been no bandwidth issues, said            Mark Griswold,      professor of radiology at Case Western’s School of Medicine and director at the university’s Interactive Commons institute, which researched the technology. The experience has Ms. Workman thinking beyond the current crisis. “My intention is to really take this to any class,” she said. “This is a way online learning or remote learning should really happen. Not through a 2-D screen. We want them interacting,” Ms. Workman said. The university, which has more than 30,000 students at campuses in Salt Lake City and Incheon, South Korea, plans to extend remote learning through summer sessions. It is also developing chatbots to advise students on common questions such as financial aid, admissions and courses. It says the chatbot could be deployed before the fall semester starts. The university is tracking remote-learning data for insight into student preferences and how to personalize such experiences in the future, said            Steve Hess,      the CIO. “We want to get some analytics and information about how this whole experience went so that we make it better. And we’re in the process of figuring out ways to do that,"" Mr. Hess said. CIO            Paige Francis      is using the move to online classes to upgrade the university’s 25-year-old enterprise-resource-planning system and digitize processes that once required paperwork. “Now more than ever, if we’re going to remain online for an extended period of time, from a technology perspective, we need to make sure that we are staying the course on goals that we have set right now,” Ms. Francis said.

Governments in China, Singapore, Israel and South Korea that are already using such data credit the practice with helping slow the spread of the virus. The U.S. and European nations, which have often been more protective of citizens’ data than those countries, are now looking at a similar approach, using apps and cellphone data. “I think that everything is gravitating towards proximity tracking,” said Chris Boos, a member of Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing, a project that is working to create a shared system that could take uploads from apps in different countries. “If somebody gets sick, we know who could be infected, and instead of quarantining millions, we’re quarantining 10.” The U.S. federal government, working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is creating a portal that will compile phone geolocation data to help authorities predict where outbreaks could next occur and determine where resources are needed, though the effort faces privacy concerns. The anonymized data from the mobile-advertising industry shows which retail establishments, parks and other public spaces are still drawing crowds that could risk accelerating the transmission of the virus.  Alphabet Inc.’s  Google said Thursday it would share a portion of its huge trove of data on people’s movements.  "

Much remains unknown about the path the virus takes in the sickest patients, but an increasing number of experts believe a hyperactive immune response, rather than the virus, is what ultimately kills many Covid-19 patients. The out-of-control immune response eventually causes the patients’ lungs to stop delivering oxygen to the rest of organs, leading to respiratory failure and in some cases death, the experts say. The malfunctioning immune system may be driving the rapid decline in lung function experienced by some patients, including younger and relatively healthy ones, after the initial onset of symptoms, doctors say. As scientists race to better understand the phenomena, pharmaceutical companies including  Roche Holding AG  are partnering with hospitals to explore whether drugs proven to tamp down an out-of-control immune response could help the sickest Covid-19 patients.

The sample was collected by hazmat-clad scientists from the Institute of Virology in Wuhan that year. Stored away and forgotten until January this year, the sample from the horseshoe bat contains the virus that causes Covid-19. The scientists were mostly sampling a very similar species with slightly shorter wings, called Rhinolophus sinicus, in a successful search for the origin of the virus responsible for the SARS epidemic of 2002-03. That search had alarming implications, which were largely ignored. In Shitou Cave, south of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan, they found viruses in the bats’ droppings and anal swabs that were more similar to human SARS than anything found in palm civets, the small mammals that until then were presumed to be the source of human infection. Back in the laboratory, they found that one of the viruses from bat droppings, called WIV1, could thrive in monkey and human cells specially engineered to activate the gene for ACE2 receptors, the lock to which a coronavirus’s spike protein can fit as a key. This suggested that people could catch SARS directly from a bat dropping. Then in 2016, Ralph Baric and colleagues at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill showed that the same bat virus could infect live mice that had been engineered to express the human gene for the ACE2 receptor. The virus was “poised for human emergence,” as the title of Dr. Baric’s paper put it. When Covid-19 broke out, attention focused on pangolins, mammals often called scaly anteaters. Early analyses of the pangolin version of the virus seemed to indicate it was even more closely related to the human version than the RaTG13 bat sample was. The illegal pangolin trade for traditional Chinese medicine brings people into contact with sick animals. Just over a year ago, 21 live Malayan pangolins destined for sale in China were intercepted by anti-smuggling officers in Guangdong. Despite the best efforts of a local wildlife rescue center, 16 died with swollen, flooded lungs, rich in coronaviruses.  "

The low-sleep, high-octane sessions have attracted participants world-wide to team up online and suggest solutions to problems such as the equipment shortage for health providers or a better way to track the spread of Covid-19, the respiratory disease caused by the virus. “Everyone is looking at the urgency of the situation,” said Youseph Yazdi, executive director at Johns Hopkins Center for Bioengineering Innovation and Design, which organized a five-day hackathon in the last week of March that attracted 513 teams with 2.331 applicants from 34 countries. That hackathon was around thematic areas including how to communicate effectively about Covid-19, prevention of transmission within communities and health-care equipment shortages. Among the ideas that emerged were a location-based mobile application to track traffic in grocery stores for effective social-distancing practices, and a tool for messaging platforms to tag misinformation by analyzing keywords and redirecting users to trusted news sources. It was the first hackathon for Helen Xun, a medical student on leave from Johns Hopkins, whose team reviewed and refined design files of 3-D printed parts such as filters and splitters so ventilators could be shared among multiple patients. The team had already prototyped parts ahead of the hackathon, but got fresh ideas on designs and materials. “The hackathon opened this international forum for us to talk to people globally to assess the actual needs,” Ms. Xun said. Hackathons were made popular decades ago by the software community as communal, all-night sessions, often powered by pizza and various caffeinated beverages. Social distancing means today’s hackathons are conducted online, with interactions among team members happening over videoconferencing and chat tools from            Zoom Video Communications      and            Slack Technologies Inc. The rapid spread of the coronavirus, which caught many officials flat-footed, has paved the way for community-sourced solutions, ranging from hackathons to 3-D printing. “Doctors are leading the fight, but a lot of people would love to find ways to engage and help,” said Sam Lessin, a general partner at venture-capital firm Slow Ventures, which helped organize a hackathon last month, with about 19,000 participants from across 175 countries, working on themes suggested by partners such as the World Health Organization. Hackathon participants are expected to experiment to find solutions, making such events better equipped to tackle aspects of complex problems, said Estonia’s Minister of Trade’s Kaimar Karu. More than 1,000 people from around 20 countries participated in a remote hackathon that the Estonia government and local companies organized last month “There’s no known way out of this,” he said. “You can only try, experiment at a small scale and based on the results you can amplify this. If it doesn’t work at all, you essentially kill [the idea],” he said. Last weekend, Massachusetts Institute of Technology hosted a 48-hour Beat the Pandemic hackathon in which 1,500 participants worked in 238 teams. Rebecca Sereda, a researcher in the stem-cell and regenerative-biology department at Harvard University, was part of a team that in 40 hours created a mobile app that used machine learning to score individuals on immunity to Covid-19, similar to a credit score, based on data such as location, age, interactions, and health history. The team is refining the app and preparing to launch it. “It was extremely chaotic because people are constantly messaging, there’s a million notifications going at once from all these different Slack channels,” Ms. Sereda said about the experience. MIT provided access to open data sets including JHU’s epidemiological data repository and Covid-19 information compiled by the World Health Organization and the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. “We had many partners from the health-care space and clinical partners involved. It is up to them to work with the teams to take the solutions developed and work toward putting those in market,” said Paul Cheek, a hacker-in-residence at Martin Trust Center for MIT Entrepreneurship, which organized the hackathon. —Catherine Stupp contributed to this article Write to Agam Shah at agam.shah@wsj.com Copyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

In the year 2019 B.C. (Before Coronavirus), homeowners or their housekeepers could basically scrub, wipe, dust and vacuum their way to a clean house. But now many homeowners are hiring companies with specialized tools and chemicals to disinfect their homes as a way to protect themselves and their families from the deadly infection. “Our requests for disinfection services have more than doubled since the pandemic occurred,” says Pete Duncanson, director of commercial operations for ServiceMaster Restore, the brand best known for cleaning up homes and businesses after disasters, like flooding and fires. The Memphis-based company, which also includes Merry Maids cleaning service, has about 3,000 franchises across the U.S. that can dispatch technicians to both clean and disinfect homes. Before disinfecting,  ServiceMaster  techs focus on the basics of cleaning to remove everyday dirt and dust. “The biggest mistake people make is that they think they can spray a magic bullet. But if they don’t clean the soil, disinfecting won’t work,” Mr. Duncanson says.  "

A better understanding of the bug and its biology will pave the way for treatments, vaccines and more efficient mitigation methods. So it’s not a good sign that the West’s premier journal of natural science appears to be indulging in political obsessions and language control at the expense of critical discovery. Nature magazine this week published a remarkable editorial in which it lambasted those “who had erroneously been associating the virus with Wuhan and China.” The virus originated in Wuhan, China, likely in November. The editors admitted they had in the past identified the virus with Wuhan, and added, “That we did so was an error on our part, for which we take responsibility and apologize.” The journal chastises President Trump, of course, but also politicians in the United Kingdom for “saying that China bears responsibility.” The Chinese government’s suppression of information about the virus and manipulation of the World Health Organization are well-documented. One reason sober scientific judgment is sometimes challenged by politicians is that institutions like Nature thrust themselves into political debates where they have no special authority. Ivy League biologists compete to publish their research in Nature, and the magazine’s approach could threaten the scientific enterprise. That the virus originated in China is important to understanding its qualities. If it jumped to humans from bats or pangolins, as widely thought, which species are present in Wuhan or sold at its wet markets? And what does the rate of spread in Wuhan tell us about how fast it would spread in cities with different densities and climates? These questions ought to be explored in scholarship published in Nature, but they may become sensitive or taboo if the journal’s official position is that associating “a virus and the disease it causes with a specific place is irresponsible and needs to stop.”  "

But there’s already one way to ensure future pandemics are less deadly: Reform or defund the World Health Organization (WHO). Last week Florida Senator Rick Scott called for a Congressional investigation into the United Nations agency’s “role in helping Communist China cover up information regarding the threat of the Coronavirus.” The rot at WHO goes beyond canoodling with Beijing, but that’s a good place to start. The coronavirus outbreak began in Wuhan, China, sometime in the autumn, perhaps as early as November. It accelerated in December. Caixin Global reported that Chinese labs had sequenced the coronavirus genome by the end of December but were ordered by Chinese officials to destroy samples and not publish their findings. On Dec. 30 Dr. Li Wenliang warned Chinese doctors about the virus, and several days later local authorities accused him of lies that “severely disturbed the social order.” Taiwanese officials warned WHO on Dec. 31 that they had seen evidence that the virus could be transmitted human-to-human. But the agency, bowing to Beijing, doesn’t have a normal relationship with Taiwan. On Jan. 14 WHO tweeted, “Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission.” The agency took another week to reverse that misinformation. On Jan. 22-23 a WHO emergency committee debated whether to declare Covid-19 a “public health emergency of international concern.” The virus already had spread to several countries, and making such a declaration would have better prepared the world. It should have been an easy decision, despite Beijing’s objections. Yet director-general Tedros Ghebreyesus declined and instead traveled to China.  "

New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago, the country’s largest cities, released figures showing the virus is having a disproportionate impact on racial minorities, particularly those who are poor. Epidemiologists say people who live in poverty can often be at higher risk of contracting the virus and suffering more severe complications, since they often can’t afford to adhere to social-distancing guidelines and have higher rates of underlying medical conditions than the general population. On Wednesday, New York City said that Hispanic coronavirus victims make up 34% of all fatalities from Covid-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, while comprising 29% of the city’s population of 8.4 million people, the data showed. Black residents account for 28% of the city’s deaths, while making up 22% of the population. “There are clear inequalities, clear disparities on how this disease is affecting the people of this city,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said during a press conference Wednesday, although he noted the virus has affected every neighborhood in the city. “We have to come up with new strategies to address what is now a documented disparity.” On Tuesday, officials in Los Angeles County said that black people accounted for 17% of Covid-19 deaths where race was known. African-Americans make up about 9% of the county’s population.  "

Nursing homes and other senior-living facilities in the U.S. have reported at least 15,473 coronavirus cases, according to data collected from 37 states that responded to requests from the Journal, which contacted all 50 health departments. Families with mothers and fathers in nursing homes, or preparing to place a relative in a facility, have wanted to know the risks their loved ones face, advocates say. Yet disclosure practices vary, and there often isn’t information publicly available about individual facilities’ coronavirus cases. The closest the federal government came to detailing the virus’s full impact on nursing homes came last month, when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported there had been more than 400 long-term care facilities with coronavirus cases in the U.S. as of March 27. The Journal’s figures suggest the virus’s impact in one of the country’s most vulnerable populations is worse than known, despite efforts to protect the residents.

He was 73 years old. Mr. Prine had been hospitalized with Covid-19 symptoms at the end of March, and his condition quickly deteriorated. A master storyteller with Midwestern roots, Mr. Prine was widely regarded among five decades of contemporaries from the 1970s until his death as one of the most influential artists in folk and country music. His poetic turn of phrase elevated simple lyrics and plain melodies into profound statements about love and life, current events and society. He survived cancer twice. The son of a tool and die maker and a homemaker from Kentucky, Mr. Prine was born and raised in Chicago suburb Maywood, Ill., where his older brother taught him to play guitar at age 14. He worked as a mailman and served in the Army in Germany during the Vietnam War before beginning his music career. He had been singing his original songs at open mic nights when Roger Ebert, then the Chicago Sun-Times movie critic, heard him and in his first review described a “singing mailman who delivers a powerful message in a few words.” “He sings rather quietly, and his guitar work is good, but he doesn’t show off. He starts slow,” wrote Mr. Ebert in 1970. “But after a song or two, even the drunks in the room begin to listen to his lyrics. And then he has you.” Mr. Prine’s underground reputation grew alongside Chicago’s folk revival as he performed across the city’s clubs. After being discovered by Kris Kristofferson, his debut self-titled album was released with Atlantic Records in 1971, including enduring classics “Illegal Smile,” “Sam Stone,” “Angel From Montgomery,” “Paradise” and “Hello in There”—a song that went on to be covered many times over. After releasing three more albums with Atlantic, and a subsequent three with Asylum Records, Mr. Prine decided to leave the major label system, which he felt exploited artists. He started independent record company Oh Boy Records, in Nashville with his longtime manager, the late Al Bunetta, in 1981—decades before the notion of artists owning their work became normalized with the digital era. The rest of Mr. Prine’s studio albums—another 12, starting with “Aimless Love” and ending with “The Tree of Forgiveness” in 2018—plus three live albums, were released on the label, which remains independent. Though Mr. Prine never had a commercial hit, his songs have been recorded and covered by a who’s who of country, folk and rock: the Highwaymen, Johnny Cash, Bette Midler, Paul Westerberg, John Denver and Bonnie Raitt among them. He wrote “I Just Want to Dance With You,” which hit No. 1 on Billboard’s country chart when George Strait released it in 1998, the same year Mr. Prine was diagnosed with skin cancer. While being treated, he underwent surgery to remove a piece of his neck that severed nerves in his tongue and radiation that damaged his salivary glands. After a year of rehabilitation he was able to perform again, with a gravelly vocal tone. Fifteen years later, he lost his left lung to cancer. Within six months, Mr. Prine was back to touring. He was a prolific collaborator, beginning with Steve Goodman in his earliest days in Chicago, though he favored women as singing partners. “I’ve always been a sucker for a duet, you know?” said Mr. Prine in a 2016 interview with The Wall Street Journal discussing “For Better, or Worse,” his second collection of duets, which included Miranda Lambert and Kacey Musgraves. The album’s 1999 predecessor, “In Spite of Ourselves,” along with the track of the same name, is among his most celebrated recorded works and saw him team up with Emmylou Harris, Trisha Yearwood and Iris DeMent, among others. Mr. Prine was nominated for 11 Grammy Awards, and won best contemporary folk album twice, for 1991’s “The Missing Years” and 2005’s “Fair & Square.” This year the Recording Academy awarded him a lifetime-achievement award. Before the novel coronavirus swept across the world, Mr. Prine had a theater tour scheduled for May through February from Kentucky to England. Mr. Prine’s wife and manager, Fiona Whelan Prine, was diagnosed with the virus earlier in March, and the couple had been self-quarantining and isolated from one another. He is survived by his wife, who recovered from the virus in March; sons Tommy and Jack; stepson Jody Whelan; and his brothers, David and Billy. “In my songs,” Mr. Prine told Mr. Ebert in that 1970 review, “I try to look through someone else’s eyes, and I want to give the audience a feeling more than a message.” Write to Anne Steele at Anne.Steele@wsj.com Copyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Hong Kong should have been slammed by Covid-19. The city of 7.5 million is among the world’s most densely populated and has the world’s busiest overland border crossings with mainland China. Hong Kong was seeded in January with the new coronavirus by travelers leaving Wuhan, China. In February, it recorded the world’s second known death outside China from the disease. But this global financial hub avoided the steep rise of infections seen in many places. The city had recorded 961 cases as of Wednesday afternoon local time, more than half of them imported, with four deaths. All the while, Hong Kong remained mostly open for business, offering hope to cities such as New York mired in crippling lockdowns. Trains fill up at rush hour and office workers line up at restaurants at lunch, most wearing loosefitting surgical masks. Across the globe, the debate over wearing masks to contain the virus is shifting—reflecting evidence that infected people with no symptoms can spread the virus, and the idea that mask use is more about protecting others than protecting the wearer. U.S. officials are encouraging the use of homemade face coverings to preserve medical masks for medical personnel. In Hong Kong, there was never any doubt about the need for face masks. Most people here, including an epidemiologist helping guide the response, are adamant that widespread mask use has been crucial in keeping the city from becoming a viral hot zone.  "

The companies are by far the world’s biggest smartphone software providers, with billions of users world-wide. The companies said jointly Friday that the “contact tracing tools” they are developing would be built into smartphones, using existing Bluetooth technology that tracks whether phones have passed within a certain distance of one another. If a user tests positive for the coronavirus and chooses to participate in the system, other phones will be able to search through their location data to determine whether they passed close enough for long enough to risk a potential exposure within the past 14 days. Those unknowing individuals—provided they, too, have opted in—would receive a notification on their own phones, according to draft documents posted by the companies, such as, “ALERT: You have recently been exposed to someone who has tested positive for Covid-19. Tap for more information.” Apple and Google will release next month the first versions of software for the alert apps, which could be developed by public-health authorities, among others.  "

The study, by the economic-analysis firm Moody’s Analytics, offers one of the most comprehensive looks yet at how much of the world’s largest economy has shut down in the past three weeks. It also analyzes counties big and small—from Manhattan to tiny Gilpin County, Colo.—to estimate how a concentration of government shutdown orders in the counties that produce a disproportionate share of the nation’s goods and services has weighed on the national picture. While 8 in 10 U.S. counties are under lockdown orders, according to Moody’s, they represent nearly 96% of national output. Forty-one states have ordered at least some businesses to close to reduce the spread of the coronavirus, according to Moody’s. Restaurants, universities, gyms, movie theaters, public parks, boutiques and millions of other “nonessential” businesses have shut off the lights as a result. The upshot: U.S. daily output has fallen roughly 29%, compared with the first week of March, just before the spate of closures, the analysis shows. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, doesn’t believe the 29% monthly drop in daily output will be sustained over two more months. If it did, gross domestic product would fall at a roughly 75% annual rate in the second quarter. Mr. Zandi believes many counties will reopen before the summer and projects a 30% annualized decline in second-quarter GDP.  "

One U.K. police force uses drones to monitor public areas, shaming residents who go out for a stroll. The Covid-19 pandemic is ushering in a new era of digital surveillance and rewiring the world’s sensibilities about data privacy. Governments are imposing new digital surveillance tools to track and monitor individuals. Many citizens have welcomed tracking technology intended to bolster defenses against the novel coronavirus. Yet some privacy advocates are wary, concerned that governments might not be inclined to unwind such practices after the health emergency has passed. Authorities in Asia, where the virus first emerged, have led the way. Many governments didn’t seek permission from individuals before tracking their cellphones to identify suspected coronavirus patients. South Korea, China and Taiwan, after initial outbreaks, chalked up early successes in flattening infection curves to their use of tracking programs. In Europe and the U.S., where privacy laws and expectations are more stringent, governments and companies are taking different approaches. European nations monitor citizen movement by tapping telecommunications data that they say conceals individuals’ identities."

The Covid-19 shutdowns have been based on the premise that the disease would kill more than two million Americans absent drastic actions to slow its spread. That model assumed case fatality rates—the share of infected people who die from the disease—of 1% to 3%. The World Health Organization’s estimated case-fatality rate was 3.4%. Some experts—including in these pages—have questioned this assumption. They argue that known cases are likely only a small portion of the true number of infections, and thus high case-fatality rates could be off by orders of magnitude. We don’t know what portion of infections have gone undetected for a lack of tests, restrictive qualifications to get tested, and a potentially large incidence of mild illness or asymptomatic infection. New data support the skeptics’ view—a preliminary study by a Stanford team, released Friday. They conducted a seroprevalence study of Santa Clara County, Calif., on April 3 and 4. They studied a representative sample of 3,300 residents to test for the presence of antibodies in their blood that would show if they had previously been infected with the novel coronavirus. The county, where I live, is home to about two million people in the heart of Silicon Valley, including San Jose, the state’s third-largest city.

While Covid-19 is a respiratory disease, doctors increasingly report that some patients develop cardiovascular complications such as heart-rhythm disorders, blood clots and inflammation causing chest pain that mimics a heart attack. These complications can be deadly. “We’ve certainly seen cardiac arrests,” said Matthew Tomey, director of the cardiac intensive-care unit at Mount Sinai Morningside Hospital in New York City. “It’s very clear that there is a cardiovascular involvement in Covid-19 disease,” said Nir Uriel, director of advanced heart failure and cardiac transplantation at New York-Presbyterian Hospital.

The U.S. death toll has continued to rise since then, reaching a total of around 33,000, with record fatalities over a 24-hour period to Thursday. But stay-at-home measures and increased testing across the country have shown signs of slowing the pandemic’s rapid spread. The economic damage from the shutdown has mounted as Americans cut retail spending by a record amount in March and industrial output dropped at its steepest rate in more than 70 years. Economists have signaled a recovery will likely be slow, and executives predict business operations won’t fully return to normal until a vaccine is deployed, estimated at least a year away. As a result, Mr. Trump also has focused on issues other than the death toll during a crucial two weeks of his presidency: reopening the economy as quickly as is safely possible and responding to criticism of his administration’s handling of the crisis, according to advisers inside and outside the White House. Those themes, discussed privately between the president and his advisers, have played out in public during Mr. Trump’s news conferences accompanied by members of the White House coronavirus task force. On Thursday he released guidelines on criteria the government wants states to meet before lifting economic restrictions, leaning toward health experts’ advice to proceed slowly despite pressure for a speedier return.

One-time empires shattered into new states, and temporary border closures became permanent, as did supposedly transient wartime restrictions on individual liberties. The 1920s brought a protectionist and nationalist wave, economic distress and, eventually, the collapse of democratic societies, from Italy to Germany, and the disappearance of Zweig’s Austria. By 1942, when he was finishing his memoir, World War II was raging, and he was a stateless refugee in faraway Brazil. Zweig mailed the manuscript to his publisher and then committed suicide. When that war ended three years later, however, the borderless, globalized world so eloquently mourned by Zweig began to bounce back, at least in the West. The architecture of the modern international community—from financial institutions like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to the U.N. to NATO and the precursors of the European Union—emerged from the conflict’s rubble. Ever more people began to enjoy the freedoms that Zweig had once known. That world, our world, had seemed until recently an irreversible certainty. Europeans took for granted their long-established right to travel across the continent without a passport. Hundreds of millions around the world went on vacation, bought property, studied and worked across national borders. The Earth belonged, if not to all, then at least to the very many with the right citizenship and a bit of disposable income. The question now is how much of that world can come back, as it did after Zweig’s tragic death. We are still in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, but nearly everywhere on the planet, the most immediate political impact of the crisis has been the resurgence of the nation-state, claiming the kind of control that few citizens of democracies have experienced in their lifetimes. It is, after all, an environment where every person poses a potential threat. And so surveillance technologies once reserved for deterring terrorism are increasingly applied to the public at large, with countries such as South Korea and Israel leading the way.  "

By Sunday, Spain had lost 350 people per million of its population to Covid-19, Italy 322, Belgium 314, France 202 and Britain 145, according to Johns Hopkins University data. Romania, in contrast, had lost 15 per million, the Czech Republic 12, Poland 5 and Slovakia 0.4. A big reason for the discrepancy: The poorer countries of Central and Eastern Europe, fearing their relatively weak health-care systems would be overwhelmed by the virus, moved more quickly to enact strict social-distancing rules and restrict movement to contain outbreaks. Their speed and decisiveness, public-health experts say, were critical for these countries, where populations are older and doctors fewer than in the West and where hospitals aren’t as well equipped for a flood of seriously ill patients. It also helped that the virus was slower to first appear in the region, which receives fewer intercontinental travelers than their hard-hit counterparts.  "

Questions about how the health crisis originated are one part of a broader diplomatic and public-relations battle between the U.S. and China over the pandemic. No concrete evidence has emerged publicly so far to confirm the theory that the outbreak, which has killed nearly 140,000 people world-wide, resulted from an accident or lax safety procedures at a Chinese lab that was trying to develop ways to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. But continued speculation about the lab underscores how key questions about the coronavirus’s origin remain unanswered and what senior U.S. officials describe as Beijing’s lack of transparency. Army Gen.            Mark Milley,      the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has confirmed that the possibility that an accident at the lab might have released the virus is being looked at by U.S. intelligence agencies.  “It should be no surprise to you that we’ve taken a keen interest in that, and we’ve had a lot of intelligence take a hard look at that,” Gen. Milley told reporters Tuesday. “And I would just say at this point it’s inconclusive, although the weight of evidence seems to indicate natural. But we don’t know for certain.” The Chinese government has denied that the virus came out of a laboratory. In a press briefing Thursday, China’s Foreign Ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, said “China’s position with regard to the origin and transmission routes of the novel coronavirus is clear”—that it didn’t emerge from a laboratory. With critics saying President Trump’s response to the pandemic has been slow and ineffective, White House aides have sought to focus blame on China for withholding information about the severity of the health crisis and waiting until Jan. 20 to acknowledge that the coronavirus could be transmitted among humans. “We know that this virus originated in Wuhan, China. We know that there is the Wuhan Institute of Virology just a handful of miles away from where the wet market was. There’s still lots to learn,” Secretary of State            Mike Pompeo       told Fox News on Wednesday, referring to a live animal market where some health experts have said the outbreak likely originated. “We really need the Chinese government to open up,” Mr. Pompeo said. “They say they want to cooperate. One of the best ways they could find to cooperate would be to let the world in, to let the world’s scientists know exactly how this came to be, exactly how this virus began to spread.” Precisely how the pandemic began remains a mystery. One theory among some epidemiologists and experts is that the novel coronavirus originated in a bat before infecting humans, perhaps through transmission at a market in Wuhan that sold wild animals. The location of specialized labs near the pandemic’s ground zero has led to alternate theories among some critics of China as well as some researchers about how the outbreak began. Not all scientific experts subscribe to the notion that the virus was transmitted naturally, and not all Trump administration officials have concluded a laboratory was at fault. Richard Ebright,      a microbiologist at Rutgers University, said that the first human infection from the coronavirus “could have occurred as a natural accident” but that a laboratory error is also plausible. “Bat coronaviruses are collected and studied by laboratories in multiple parts of China,” including the two labs in Wuhan, Mr. Ebright wrote in an email. He noted there have been previous mishaps with coronaviruses, including four separate incidents in Singapore, Taiwan and China in 2003 and 2004 in which SARS infected human populations because of laboratory accidents. Wuhan, a city of about 11 million, is home to several biological laboratories. One, the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory, was the first in China to be certified to handle study of the world’s most dangerous known pathogens. It was designed with French assistance as part of an effort to control infectious disease and is associated with the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Get a coronavirus briefing six days a week, and a weekly Health newsletter once the crisis abates: Sign up here. State Department officials who visited the facility in early 2018 raised concerns about the safety of the lab. In diplomatic cables, they described a shortage of trained technicians to safely operate the lab and the potential for coronaviruses to be transmitted to humans. The Washington Post earlier reported on the cables. While the State Department has declined to discuss them, a person familiar with the lab issue confirmed their authenticity. A 2017 article in the scientific journal Nature also reported some experts’ concerns that pathogens might escape from the biosafety lab. Chinese officials told the publication that the lab would uphold the most stringent safety standards and would have the capability to withstand a strong earthquake. Nature appended a note to the archived article in January 2020 saying that it knows of no evidence that this lab had played a role in the pandemic. A second research institute in the area, the Wuhan Center for Disease Prevention and Control, has also figured in some theories about the origin of the virus. Mr. Trump indicated at his Wednesday news conference that he was aware of media reports that the virus might have escaped from the lab, but declined to say whether he had talked about the lab in his phone conversations with Chinese President            Xi Jinping. “We are doing a very thorough examination of this horrible situation that happened,” Mr. Trump said. “I don’t want to discuss what I talked to him about the laboratory.” In China, there was some early speculation that a Wuhan laboratory might be linked to the emergence of the new coronavirus.            Botao Xiao      of South China University of Technology, who previously worked in Wuhan, published a short paper in February, asserting that “the killer coronavirus probably originated from a laboratory in Wuhan.” That paper referred to previous episodes in which pathogens had been mishandled in other parts of China and noted that a Wuhan researcher had sometimes been bitten by bats. After that paper received media attention in the West, Chinese authorities and its state media firmly denied that there had been any lab accident. Mr. Xiao told the Journal in a Feb. 26 email that he had withdrawn his paper. “The speculation about the possible origins in the post was based on published papers and media, and was not supported by direct proofs.” Write to Warren P.

Many had volunteered for re-examination after exhibiting symptoms such as coughing. Others submitted to extra testing on little more than a hunch despite not showing symptoms. So far, these patients—all of whom needed to twice test negative before leaving medical supervision—haven’t spread the virus to others, local health officials say. The initial belief, according to South Korean doctors directly involved with a government review, is that the virus has “reactivated” in the patients, meaning the disease went dormant and came back. The research remains ongoing and inconclusive. The Seoul government’s report will take at least a month to complete, they say. South Korea is closely watched as an early indicator of how Covid-19 lingers across a population, having flattened its curve of new infections and now contemplating an unwinding of social-distancing measures. The results showing people testing positive a second time could signal a worrisome potential for the virus to linger that could impact health policy. “It may be that you have to test these recovered people every month for symptoms or viruses,” said Mary Guinan, a former chief scientific adviser to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director. “Maybe it comes and goes.

Socioeconomic factors such as gaps in access to health care no doubt play a role. But another possible factor has been largely overlooked: vitamin D deficiency that weakens the immune system. Researchers last month released the first data supporting this link. Based on a link between levels of the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein and severe cases of Covid-19, they estimate that tens of thousands of lives could be saved world-wide by normalizing vitamin D levels, through its modulation of the inflammatory cascade. Vitamin D is produced by a reaction in the skin to the ultraviolet rays in sunlight. Many Americans are low in vitamin D, but those with darker skin are at a particular disadvantage because melanin inhibits the vitamin’s production. As an Indian-American, my skin type is Fitzpatrick IV, or “moderate brown.” Compared with my white friends, I need double or triple the sun exposure to synthesize the same amount of vitamin D, so I supplement with 5,000 international units of vitamin D3 daily, which maintains my level in the normal range. Most African-Americans are Fitzpatrick type V or VI, so they would need even more. This requires further study, but earlier research is suggestive. In 2018 a longitudinal study by researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital looked at whether vitamin D supplementation had any health benefits, specifically in regard to heart disease and cancer. The overall conclusion was that it didn’t, for most people. Yet buried in the results was one that should have made headlines: Vitamin D supplementation in African-Americans reduced cancer risk 23%. How? Cancer cells develop regularly in most animals, including humans, as the result of toxic injuries or glitches in DNA replication, but a healthy immune system destroys them. There is evidence that low vitamin D levels make the immune system go blind. Dozens of studies confirm that deficiency is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, which disproportionately afflicts African-Americans. A major contributor to heart disease is inflammation that targets blood vessels, forming the plaques that block blood flow. (Raising vitamin D levels with supplements hasn’t been shown to reverse this effect.)  "

The WHO says it could be 10 times that of influenza, but I think we need to see more evidence,” Mexico’s deputy health minister, Hugo López-Gatell, said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal, referring to how deadly the virus may be. Critics say that Mr. López-Gatell’s boss, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has consistently played down the risk of the pandemic. Health experts say they fear the Mexican government is underestimating the potential impact and leaving the health-care system unprepared for the eventual demand for hospital beds and critical-care items like ventilators. “I think most people would agree that some of these assumptions are overly optimistic,” said Julio Frenk, Mexico’s former health minister and president of the University of Miami. Dr. Frenk said he estimates that Mexico’s health system is only a few weeks away from being overwhelmed. Mr. López-Gatell, 51, said he estimates the virus will eventually infect roughly two-thirds of Mexicans, the level at which enough people have developed immunity that further spread becomes more difficult. Left unchecked, the virus would run its course in as little as six weeks, overwhelming the health system, he said.

But a trip to Tomorrowland may never be the same. Guests at the Shanghai resort must wear masks at all times, removing them only for eating. Hours and capacity are limited. And just to gain entry, visitors must submit to a temperature check and present a government-controlled QR code on their phone that indicates they are virus-free. Executives around the world who rapidly overhauled operations when the coronavirus struck, and the politicians who made them do it, are now focused on restarting the economy and their own businesses. That restart, according to interviews with leaders across a range of industries, suggests that back to normal will be anything but. The re-emergence over the coming weeks and months will be fitful, fragile and partial—and a bit dystopian, with frequent temperature checks, increased monitoring of employees and customers, and, potentially, blood tests to determine whether workers have likely immunity to the virus. Officials and business leaders predict that operations won’t fully return to normal until an effective vaccine hits the market, estimated at least a year away. Some firms may bring office workers back in alternating groups to allow for social distancing in open-plan offices. Restaurant chains may operate at half capacity, installing plexiglass shields between booths, while stores may do away with tester cosmetics and sanitize items after customers try them on. Major League Baseball has discussed a season with no spectators, held in a part of the country where it can essentially sequester players for weeks at a time."

Across the country, people suddenly feeling helpless amid the coronavirus pandemic are finding a balm to soothe their stress: Identify a need, and do your best to fill it. Psychologists and stress researchers have long understood the mental and emotional benefits of doing good. In a 2015 study, Emily Ansell and her team found that performing compassionate acts, even small ones, can help mitigate the negative effects of stress on an individual’s mood and mental health. “Helping others also helps ourselves,” says Dr. Ansell, an associate professor of biobehavioral health at the Penn State College of Health and Human Development. Helping others can distract us from our own stress, increase our sense of meaning and purpose, and reduce the toll stress takes on our bodies, according to Dr. Ansell. Doing something positive for someone else can also increase our feelings of self-efficacy or control at a time when so much is outside our control. Nihal Mehta, founding general partner at Eniac Ventures in New York City, knows that feeling. In March, Mr. Mehta assembled a group of volunteer coders, pulled two all-nighters and set up a website called Help Main Street. The page includes a searchable map that allows people to locate and purchase gift cards from local businesses to support them while in quarantine.  "

Like countless other people under quarantine globally, I’m restrained within the same walls I’ve taken for granted all these years—I probably should have spent more time decorating. The Covid-19 crisis has forced us to fundamentally shift how we operate and interact as humans in just a short window. But what first seemed like a lonely dystopia has, for many, become a period of discovery. We’ve adapted nimbly, finding connection, interaction and emotional fulfillment in shared virtual space on platforms like Zoom, a live video-chat service—call it Skype on steroids—that few had heard of before early March, but that now seems to be helping stitch the torn remnants of our social fabric back together. The question is: Will we ever truly revert to our former status quo? You’d be hard-pressed to name another technology that’s been so quickly and blindly adopted as Zoom. Television took years. Social media grew in fits and starts (some of you will remember Friendster). But in the past few weeks, I’ve been invited to Zoom work meetings, happy hours, poker games and Easter brunches. I have weekly Saturday-morning coffees with my buddy Joe who’s isolating a few blocks from me in Brooklyn. Friends have attended Zoom weddings and seders, court proceedings and dance parties. “SNL” even recorded its latest episode on the now-ubiquitous platform, with host Tom Hanks performing the monologue from his (surprisingly unglamorous) kitchen. Many others have taken to FaceTime for first dates (and breakups). Some have joined yoga and spin classes on Instagram Live, played trivia on the Houseparty phone app and board games over BlueJeans, a Zoom competitor. “Video chat has become the Swiss Army Knife for every social experience we’re having right now,” said Shawn DuBravac, futurist and the bestselling author of “Digital Destiny: How the New Age of Data Will Transform the Way We Work, Live, and Communicate.” Thanks to advancing technologies, humans have persisted for millennia. And it seems that, though more physically disconnected than ever, we “will not be contained,” as Dr. Ian Malcolm portends in “Jurassic Park,” the 1993 blockbuster. “Life breaks free, it expands to new territories and it crashes through barriers—painfully maybe even dangerously,” he says. “But…life finds a way.”  "

Those blockbuster sports events are scheduled right in time for a bigger problem: the second wave of the virus. There has always been a second wave in the epidemics that have interrupted American life over the last century, from influenza to AIDS, and top infectious disease experts have been warning for weeks that history will likely repeat itself in the coronavirus pandemic. The return of this new coronavirus is the darkest shadow hanging over the future of sports, concerts and every kind of mass gathering that was commonplace before. If there is no second wave, it would break a streak of centuries. “Second waves are inevitable in pandemics when you don’t have a vaccine,” said Carlos Del Rio, head of the global-health department at Emory University, who chaired the panel that guided the National Collegiate Athletic Association to shutting down sports this spring. “Any disease when you have an epidemic, when you loosen up prevention, you’ll have a second wave.”  "

The IMF, in a new outlook, said the world economy is expected to contract by 3% in 2020 as the coronavirus pandemic causes nations around the world to close down, compared with a contraction of 0.1% in 2009, the worst year of the previous recession. This year’s decline amounts to about $2.7 trillion of global losses for the roughly $90 trillion global economy. “It is very likely that this year the global economy will experience its worst recession since the Great Depression, surpassing that seen during the global financial crisis a decade ago,” Gita Gopinath, the IMF’s chief economist, said in a note introducing the quarterly global growth update. “The great lockdown, as one might call it, is projected to shrink global growth dramatically,” she added. Unlike in the previous recession, which began in 2007 in the U.S. but was at its worst point in 2009 in most countries, nearly no country will be able to escape the economic fallout this year. Even in the depths of the prior recession, about 40% of countries continued to post per capita growth. In 2020, less than 10% of them will see growth continue, the IMF said. Though it has been clear for weeks that the global economy was entering a severe downturn, the new outlook gives numerical estimates of the severity of the crisis. The forecasts are fodder for the IMF and World Bank, which are conducting a virtual spring meeting this week after the coronavirus pandemic led to a cancellation of an in-person Washington gathering. The international organizations have been slow to unify around a coordinated approach to confront the pandemic.  "

More states are starting to gather information on the underlying health conditions of people who get sick with coronavirus. That will help doctors identify and treat high-risk patients, but information on the habits of infected individuals will also be important to guide reopening plans. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has directed hospitals to begin asking new coronavirus patients for their occupation, usual transportation mode and neighborhood. Although New York has been shut down for seven weeks, several thousand people are still testing positive and hundreds are being hospitalized each day. Last week Mr. Cuomo disclosed some preliminary findings: Twenty-two percent of those who entered the hospital came from a nursing home or assisted living facility. Ninety-six percent had an underlying health condition. Yet only 17% were employed, and only 4% in New York City had been taking public transportation. “We were thinking that maybe we were going to find a higher percentage of essential employees who were getting sick because they were going to work—that these may be nurses, doctors, transit workers. That’s not the case,” he said. “They’re not working, they’re not traveling, they’re predominantly downstate, predominantly minority, predominantly older.” More investigation is needed, but the virus may be spreading mostly within multigenerational households or public housing. Collecting more information about infected individuals’ habits would have been especially useful early in the pandemic before most businesses were shut down. This data could reveal patterns that suggest the most likely venues for transmission.  "

The billionaire spent hundreds of millions of dollars to find faster ways to develop vaccines and create disease-tracking systems. He urged world leaders to build national defenses against new infectious diseases. Looking back, Mr. Gates said, “I wish I had done more to call attention to the danger.” The Microsoft Corp. co-founder is now squaring off against the scenario he sought to forestall. “I feel terrible,” he said in an interview. “The whole point of talking about it was that we could take action and minimize the damage.” In his second career as philanthropist and co-chair of one of the wealthiest foundations dedicated to global health and American education, Mr. Gates, 64 years old, has put himself at the center of the Covid-19 pandemic that has killed more than 283,000 people and crashed the world economy. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation pays for researchers seeking treatments, and it is working with pharmaceutical executives and governments to produce billions of doses of promising vaccines while they are being tested so they can be dispensed as soon as regulators approve them. The foundation has helped reserve space in a manufacturing plant so production of the most effective new medicines can begin quickly."

The need to find therapies for the disease caused by the new coronavirus grows as the number of cases increases. As of Sunday, there were over 4.1 million confirmed Covid-19 cases globally, according to Johns Hopkins University. The Northwestern team, basing their work on social and behavioral scientific papers, trained an AI model to estimate the chances that a scientific paper’s findings could be replicated by other researchers.

The alert came as U.S. officials charge that China and Iran since at least Jan. 3 have waged cyberattacks against American firms and institutions that are working to find a vaccine for Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, officials said. The attacks have raised the prospect among some officials that the efforts could be viewed by the Trump administration as a direct attack on U.S. public health, they said, because the attacks may have hindered vaccine research in some cases. Such an interpretation would represent an escalation of how the U.S. government views cyberattacks against the country. In the alert Wednesday, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the cyber wing of the Department of Homeland Security, said that Chinese-affiliated “cyber actors and nontraditional collectors” had been identified attempting to steal intellectual property and public-health data related to research on Covid-19 vaccines, treatments and testing.

The 79-year-old was being moved to make space for incoming hospital patients recovering from coronavirus. Ms. Hickey was told the St. James, N.Y., facility had no choice but to take in these patients under a new state policy. Ms. Hickey said that after a few days she struggled to reach staff for updates on her sister, and after repeated calls, one employee told her why. The nursing home was overwhelmed with cases of Covid-19, the illness caused by the virus. Luxor Nursing & Rehabilitation had no confirmed coronavirus cases before the patients moved in, and can’t say if any arrived while still infectious, a spokesman said. But he added: Luxor “would not have accepted [the patients] without this directive.” After mounting criticism and thousands of deaths in New York nursing homes—including several individual facilities that have lost more than 50 residents—the state on Sunday reversed the mandate, which said nursing homes couldn’t refuse to accept patients from hospitals who had been diagnosed with Covid-19. New York now says hospitals can send patients to nursing homes only if they have tested negative for the virus. The policy before the U-turn is one of several decisions the state made that are now coming under fire, as New York’s death toll tied to nursing homes rises, to 5,398 presumed and confirmed fatalities as of May 12, more than any other state and a significant part of New York’s total deaths.

Newly released Congressional testimony shows that Adam Schiff spread falsehoods shamelessly about Russia and Donald Trump for three years even as his own committee gathered contrary evidence. The House Intelligence Committee last week released 57 transcripts of interviews it conducted in its investigation into Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election. The committee probe started in January 2017 under then-Chair Devin Nunes and concluded in March 2018 with a report finding no evidence that the Trump campaign conspired with the Kremlin. Most of the transcripts were ready for release long ago, but Mr. Schiff oddly refused to release them after he became chairman in 2019. He only released them last week when the White House threatened to do it first. Now we know why. From the earliest days of the collusion narrative, Mr. Schiff insisted that he had evidence proving the plot. In March 2017 on MSNBC, Mr. Schiff teased that he couldn’t “go into particulars, but there is more than circumstantial evidence now.” In December 2017 he told CNN that collusion was a fact: “The Russians offered help, the campaign accepted help. The Russians gave help and the President made full use of that help.” In April 2018, Mr. Schiff released his response to Mr. Nunes’s report, stating that its finding of no collusion “was unsupported by the facts and the investigative record.” None of this was true, and Mr. Schiff knew it. In July 2017, here’s what former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told Mr. Schiff and his colleagues: “I never saw any direct empirical evidence that the Trump campaign or someone in it was plotting/conspiring with the Russians to meddle with the election.” Three months later, former Obama Attorney General Loretta Lynch agreed that while she’d seen “concerning” information, “I don’t recall anything being briefed up to me.” Former Deputy AG Sally Yates concurred several weeks later: “We were at the fact-gathering stage here, not the conclusion stage.”  "

The outbreak has also penetrated deep in Japan, but, according to official data, left one region of over a million people unscathed. Iwate, on Japan’s northeastern Pacific coast, is alone among the country’s 47 prefectures in reporting no Covid-19 cases since Japan recorded its first case in January. The situation is almost unheard of for state-sized regions in other major countries and a turn of fortune for a region familiar with the deadly impact of nature. Iwate—pronounced “ee-wah-teh”—was one of the worst-hit regions by a massive 2011 earthquake and tsunami. Nearly 5,800 people were confirmed dead or lost in the disaster in the prefecture. Geography is likely also part of the reason why Iwate has skirted the coronavirus. Its mountainous terrain is a natural barrier for the easy spread of the virus between smaller coastal communities hit by the tsunami and the more populous interior.  "

The question is: Will there be an office to go back to when this is all over? The changes the business world is considering offer a radical rethinking of a place that is central to corporate life. There will likely be fewer offices in the center of big cities, more hybrid schedules that allow workers to stay home part of the week and more elbow room as companies free up space for social distancing. Smaller satellite offices could also pop up in less-expensive locations as the workforce becomes less centralized. In San Francisco,  Twitter Inc.  notified employees this week that most of them could continue to work from home indefinitely. Canadian information-technology provider  OpenText Corp.  expects to eliminate more than half of its 120 offices globally. And Skift Inc., a New York media company, is giving up its Manhattan headquarters when its lease expires in July. The modifications could have a profound impact on millions of workers who defined their work lives around a daily trip into “the office,” with consequences that aren’t yet known. Some employees in coastal cities might be able to take their existing salaries to places with a lower cost of living. But that may also mean those workers can be easily replaced by someone offshore, where costs are even lower. Employees would gain flexibility, but they might miss the temporary respite from domestic responsibilities and exchanging ideas in more impromptu ways. Big companies would save on real estate costs, but they might struggle to outbid smaller companies for the best talent if traditional office perks like free food and bike storage are no longer as essential as they once were. The zeal for a new definition of the traditional office is driven in part by the shrinking economy, as companies look for new ways to cut costs during a downturn that is expected to be the worst since the Great Depression. Many executives also point to the success of an unprecedented work-from-home experiment, and how little productivity appears to have been impacted after millions of employees in technology, media, finance and other industries have been forced to work remotely for months.

It’s an important benchmark for other governments as they allow their own economies to emerge from viral hibernation. Scientists at the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), the German government’s epidemiological advisory service, calculate that the coronavirus resumed its spread through the population as the country’s lockdown started easing in late April. The reproduction rate, or R0, was above 1 for several days this week, and as high as 1.1 last weekend. That means that each person infected with the virus transmits it on average to 1.1 other people—exponential growth. This is as much a political event as a medical one. It seems inevitable that the coronavirus will spread as rapidly as any respiratory virus as lockdowns ease. But Chancellor            Angela Merkel      made a transmission rate of less than 1 a central plank of her reopening plan. In an April press conference, Mrs. Merkel instructed Germans on precisely how overwhelmed hospitals would become at each level of R0 above 1. The RKI estimated the transmission rate at around 0.8 before Mrs. Merkel started easing the lockdown. Germans were warned that restrictions might return if the disease resumed its spread. Yet now Berlin and the 16 state governments responsible for local reopening policies are discovering they can tolerate a somewhat higher reproduction rate after all. Mrs. Merkel is sticking to a broader plan she announced last week under which most shops can reopen, schools will resume soon, and religious services and some sports will be allowed. Some state governments are going further by reopening restaurants or museums. This may be partly because German voters are reconsidering how they weigh coronavirus risk against the physical, emotional, social and economic costs of a lockdown. Anti-lockdown protests occurred in several cities last weekend. Opinion polls suggest most Germans still support their government’s handling of the crisis, but the costs have been as immense as everywhere else. If Germany learns to live with a higher reproduction rate, that will be an important lesson for other politicians: Give voters more credit. Leaders from U.K. Prime Minister      Boris Johnson            to            New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo      continue to promise reproduction rates below 1 as they reopen their economies. Perhaps the public realizes this is unrealistic and won’t punish politicians who take some virus risks for the sake of restoring voters’ livelihoods. Copyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

We have become used to the spectacle of President Trump standing before reporters surrounded by a gaggle of doctors and scientific advisers—sometimes deferring to them, sometimes questioning them, sometimes berating them. Many governors have held similar briefings with their own panels of experts. This week, a Senate committee called in three of the government’s top public-health officials for testimony, and a House committee is looking to hold its own expert briefing later this month. The pronouncements of these specialists frequently drive key decisions and shape public views. But the costs and burdens of the pandemic response have driven some Americans to criticize the power of the public health professionals who designed it. Skepticism of experts and resentment of their claims to authority have grown. There have been calls to fire Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who has been a prominent counselor to the president. And Dr. Deborah Birx, who leads the White House pandemic task force, has become, in the words of one New York Times report, “a partisan Rorschach test.” The debate falls too easily into a familiar pattern. The struggle between technocratic champions of expert rule and populist defenders of the common man is an old story in the U.S. Is rational decision-making a matter of applying the concentrated expertise of a small group of specialists or of aggregating the dispersed preferences of vast swaths of society? Is a more efficient health-care system to be had by empowering just the right MIT professor to back his theories with government mandates, or by empowering market mechanisms to channel the choices of millions of consumers from the bottom up? A great deal of our domestic politics consists of disputes along these lines in different areas. But the present crisis can help us to see the inadequacy of these debates as a way to think about political leadership. When technical experts advise government officials, they aren’t just conveying neutral facts, but neither are they just playing politics. They offer informed judgment. That’s what makes them useful—and also what limits their value. The idea that scientific expertise can play a purely technical role in the political arena—that the facts speak for themselves if only we would listen—has held particular appeal for American progressives. President John F. Kennedy famously gave voice to this view in 1962, reflecting that ideological categories were growing increasingly useless because “the fact of the matter is that most of the problems, or at least many of them that we now face, are technical problems, are administrative problems…they deal with questions which are beyond the comprehension of most men.”  "

She was losing a battle with an opioid addiction started by a prescription painkiller, and says she doesn’t know where she’d be if she hadn’t gotten into Gilgal, where she had a year of counseling, and coaching on resumes and job interviews as well as budgeting and health insurance. “There’s no telling,” says the working mother who now lives in Winder, Ga., with her two young sons and her mother. “There are only a few ways I could’ve gone.” Now Covid-19 threatens Gilgal’s future. The nonprofit has been forced to cancel two of its three fundraising events: a spring luncheon and a 15-year anniversary celebration in May. Its Blue Jean gala in October is up in the air. Together the three events would have funded between a third and half the charity’s $600,000 annual operating budget; some of its donors are hurting, too. If the crisis continues, Gilgal will have to cut back on half of its programs: the tutoring, coaching and mentoring women into the workforce with life skills they need to succeed like budgeting and managing a household. Gilgal would have to cut staff, too. It would no longer be able to manage the army of volunteer groups that are a large part of its business model. “If we continue in this Covid crisis, then what’s really happening is I’m crippled,” says Val Cater, the charity’s founder and executive director. Across the country, nonprofits of all types and sizes are in trouble. They have canceled major fundraisers. They have lost huge amounts of ticket and event revenue. Those with government contracts dread what will happen when their fiscal year ends June 30. Demand for services, especially at food banks, is outpacing revenue. Most charities operate on razor-thin margins even in good times. Nonprofits are subject to tight restrictions in most government contracts. Charities are penalized if they don’t keep costs down by the benchmarking firms that donors consult to decide if charities are run well. In a survey of 3,400 nonprofits two years ago, half said they had only three months’ cash on hand or less; 19% said they had a month or less, according to the Nonprofit Finance Fund, a New York-based lender that conducted the survey. “The system sets them up to be fragile,” says            Antony Bugg-Levine,      CEO of the Nonprofit Finance Fund. The virus-related revenue disruption “is an unprecedented calamity” for nonprofits, he says. He predicts many will collapse. Nonprofits hurt by the pandemic include venerable ones like the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, which include the de Young museum and the Legion of Honor. The organization is governed by three nonprofit boards and one of them is a department of the city and county. “This is critical” read the subject line of a late-April email to the organization’s members. It faces a projected loss of $9 million in revenue on lost admissions, canceled events and two major fundraisers. It has an annual operating budget of $62 million. Most, though, are smaller nonprofits like Gilgal. Ninety-two percent of the nation’s 901,206 nonprofits that filed annual returns with the IRS for 2016 had annual budgets of less than $1 million, according to a 2019 report by the National Council of Nonprofits. Most are community-based and focused on a local need. How are you offering support to those in need during this crisis? Join the conversation below. Many have been destabilized even though the services they provide are needed now more than ever. “Our survivors and their children are trapped at home,” says            Jeehae Fischer,      executive director of New York-based Korean American Family Service Center. The agency aids immigrant survivors of domestic violence and child abuse. Calls to its emergency helpline on some days more than quadrupled. Some are calling to say they are hungry. “My heart aches. I know we need to do more,” says Ms. Fischer. But it had to cancel its April fundraiser; recently it has been close to not making its payroll, she says. But “it’s July that I’m really worried about,” she says. She knows the agency’s funding from contracts with the hard-hit New York City and state will be cut. In Los Angeles, children are in lockdown and can’t get to the Helpline Youth Counseling Center. The agency’s government funding—which makes up about 85% of its operating budget, which was about $6.7 million last year—depends on the amount of counseling it delivers. Director            Jeff Farber      worries his funding will be cut even though the community’s problems have multiplied. “We know that abuse hasn’t stopped,” he says. “The dealers are still out there.” As the virus has sapped revenue for nonprofits, it has also been a double whammy in driving up their costs—for masks, cleaning supplies, technology and food—which further restricts how many people they can reach. The challenges faced at Gilgal are similar to those many of the country’s smaller nonprofits are now dealing with. A $60,000 loan from the federal Paycheck Protection Program ensures that for three months Gilgal won’t have to cut staff. But it is meant to protect jobs, not sustain an organization, says Ms. Cater. She has applied to several funding sources, but is realistic about the odds. “I know foundations are being flooded by organizations like Gilgal, so it really is a wait and see situation right now,” she says. “Hope and pray and wait and see.” Much of the nonprofit’s food was donated by Hollywood film crews until the virus made it impossible to shoot films in Atlanta. Gilgal usually has 25 women at a time rotating through various parts of the program. Currently the number is 11. The charity isn’t accepting newcomers—even those approved and on its waiting list—until it can ensure the safety of residents and staff. “I really hate that,” says            Deborah Moore,      who is in charge of the agency’s intake and case management. She went through five addiction recovery programs, including Gilgal’s twice, before shaking her cocaine habit. “One thing about me. I have compassion for women who need help. Right now they need help,” she says. The agency is doing its best to keep the program on track. Ms. Moore holds individual case-management meetings by phone. She teaches relapse prevention and anger management classes on speaker phone. But the virus has put a halt to much of what makes Gilgal hands on. During normal times, the women get a parade of visiting experts and volunteers—students at the Georgia State University School of Nursing who teach about health, Morehouse College business students who coach career planning, resumes and a 30-second elevator pitch, church groups and sorority groups. Volunteers come to explain budgeting, saving and benefits. “What is a 401(k) because whatever it is, I got one today,” Ms. Cater recalls a resident saying after her first day at a hospital job. In normal times, the women are shepherded into jobs and often housing with the help of a web of relationships forged by Ms. Cater with agencies like the United Way and companies like the            United Parcel Service      and CKS Packaging, both based in Atlanta. CKS Packaging’s vice president            Drew Sewell      says the Gilgal women come well-prepared; many have become lifelong employees. At Ms. Powers’s global staffing company, she was just promoted. She never dreamed she’d have savings and be able to give her 11-year-old an allowance. “I just have this joy in my heart I never had before,” she says. Ms. Cater hopes she can keep Gilgal going. If she can’t make up for the lost revenue, then “everything is on the table,” she says. “We’re just a small nonprofit. We’re a debt-free organization. Even with that, it is a difficult landscape to look into and not have a handle on what the future holds.” Here are some ways to find charities in need, and a few that are serving those particularly hit hard by the pandemic. Local foundations The Community Foundation has information on local nonprofits, needs and projects. Their Community Foundation Locator lists accredited foundations nationwide. Covid-19 relief funds Giving Compass and the National Center for Family Philanthropy have created a clearinghouse of 475 Covid-19-related response and relief funds nationwide that can be searched by state or by category. Food banks Feeding America offers access to a nationwide network of food banks that secure and distribute meals through food pantries and meal programs. Search by state or ZIP Code to find a local food bank. Restaurants and Health-care Workers Frontline Foods funds meals made by local restaurants that are delivered to local medical staff. Search more than 50 cities, counties and states to donate. Cash grants Mission Asset Fund’s rapid response fund makes cash grants to low income and immigrant families, artists, college students, entrepreneurs and gig workers who won’t get government relief or unemployment. It also makes loans to small businesses. PPE for health-care providers Project N95 provides a national clearinghouse to help health-care providers source personal protective equipment from vetted suppliers. Corrections & Amplifications 			The Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, which includes the de Young museum and the Legion of Honor, has a $62 million annual budget and faces a projected $9 million revenue shortfall due to lost admissions, canceled events and two major fundraisers. An earlier version of this article incorrectly attributed the budget and expected loss to the de Young museum and failed to attribute part of the shortfall to lost admissions and a second fundraiser.

Covid-19 is not going away anytime soon. Summer may give us a break, late fall probably not. Vaccines are likely far off, new therapies and treatments might help a lot, but keeping things closed up tight until there are enough tests isn’t a viable plan. There will never be enough tests, it was botched from the beginning, if we ever catch up it will probably be at the point tests are no longer urgently needed. Meantime, we must ease up and manage. We should go forward with a new national commitment to masks, social distancing, hand washing. These simple things have proved the most valuable tools in the tool chest. We have to enter each day armored up. At the same time we can’t allow alertness to become exhaustion. We can’t let an appropriate sense of caution turn into an anxiety formation. We can’t become a nation of agoraphobics. We’ll just have to live, carefully. Here’s something we should stop. There’s a class element in the public debate. It’s been there the whole time but it’s getting worse, and few in public life are acting as if they’re sensitive to it. Our news professionals the past three months have made plenty of room for medical and professionals warning of the illness. Good, we needed it, it was news. They are not now paying an equal degree of sympathetic attention to those living the economic story, such as the Dallas woman who pushed back, opened her hair salon, and was thrown in jail by a preening judge. He wanted an apology. She said she couldn’t apologize for trying to feed her family. There is a class divide between those who are hard-line on lockdowns and those who are pushing back. We see the professionals on one side—those James Burnham called the managerial elite, and Michael Lind, in “The New Class War,” calls “the overclass”—and regular people on the other. The overclass are highly educated and exert outsize influence as managers and leaders of important institutions—hospitals, companies, statehouses. The normal people aren’t connected through professional or social lines to power structures, and they have regular jobs—service worker, small-business owner. Since the pandemic began, the overclass has been in charge—scientists, doctors, political figures, consultants—calling the shots for the average people. But personally they have less skin in the game. The National Institutes of Health scientist won’t lose his livelihood over what’s happened. Neither will the midday anchor.  "

The corporate cafeteria is closed. The coffee makers are unplugged. And the desks are separated by plastic. Every part of office life is being re-examined in the era of Covid-19. When employees file back into American workplaces—some wearing masks—many will find the office transformed, human-resources and real-estate executives say. Elevators may only take one person at a time. Desks, once tightly packed in open floor plans, will be spread apart, with some covered by plastic shields and chairs atop disposable pads to catch germs. The beer taps, snack containers, coffee bars and elaborate gyms and showers that once set high-dollar, white-collar environments apart will likely remain closed to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Many changes won’t go away until the virus does. The office adaptations reverse a decadeslong push in American corporations to cram workers into tighter spaces, with few separations between colleagues. Companies once spent millions of dollars retrofitting spaces to create rows of open desks, intimate conference rooms and elaborate communal gathering areas. Those designs are now problematic, executives say. “All our agencies are open floor plans and that was a great idea in the past, but it now works against us,” says Harris Diamond, chief executive and chairman of advertising giant McCann Worldgroup.

The numbers may undercount the true death toll, researchers say. Senior White House officials urged governors to move toward restarting commerce as signs of the economic harm rose. The U.S. unemployment rate soared to 14.7% in April, with 20.5 million jobs erased from payrolls, the Labor Department said Friday. The White House and the Republican-controlled Senate remain at odds with House Democrats who are pushing to complete their next coronavirus-aid proposal this week. Democrats argue for new spending, on top of the roughly $3 trillion of aid so far for businesses, households, states and cities, among others. But some Republicans and President Trump are advocating for a wait-and-see stance on more stimulus and have placed a priority on other policies, such as shielding businesses from liability.  "

His Tuesday Senate testimony also suggested the limits of his knowledge about public health. As for the economic impact of the shutdowns encouraged by Dr. Fauci, the disaster is manifest. The Journal’s Nick Timiraos reports on Federal Reserve Chairman            Jerome Powell’s      latest report to Congress: Does Dr. Fauci still regard life under lockdown as merely “inconvenient”? Of course economics is not his field, but presumably  as a U.S. citizen he has noticed the gargantuan impact of the government response to the virus. Yet there he was again yesterday on television encouraging more of the same as he remotely addressed a Senate hearing.  “Dr. Anthony Fauci warns senators of ‘suffering and death’ if states reopen too early,” says a CNBC headline. “Fauci warns that ‘consequences could be really serious’ if states move too quickly to reopen,” announces the Washington Post. It’s important to understand that Dr. Fauci is only focused on one set of consequences, and it’s not clear he’s analyzing them correctly.            Sen. Rand Paul      (R., Ky.), who is also a medical doctor, challenged Dr. Fauci’s views specifically on the risks posed by Covid-19, as well as the disease expert’s central role in the federal response. Dr. Paul noted that for young people, the virus has caused very low mortality, that many Covid-19 forecasts have proven to be wrong and that places like Sweden that have avoided strict lockdowns are doing better than many shuttered areas. Dr. Fauci responded in part: Dr. Fauci is clear on the fact that Americans should not rely on him to  conduct cost-benefit analysis of the policies he is recommending. Even within the realm of public health, he’s not really making the case that continuing to restrict activities will make Americans healthier overall, but only that it will, in his opinion, reduce Covid-19 deaths. Another medical doctor,            Sen. Bill Cassidy      (R., La.), asked at Tuesday’s hearing about calculating the negative impact of school shutdowns on the health of children compared to the possible benefits of avoiding Covid-19. Dr. Fauci acknowledged the challenge of the “unintended consequences of trying to do something that broadly is important for the public health, and the risk of having a return or resurgence of an outbreak and the unintended deleterious consequences of having children out of school.” He added: How on earth can a public health official endorse the radical step of closing schools without at least presenting an argument that it would have a net benefit for public health? Bret Schundler writes in the Journal today about the urgent need for governors to keep food plants open, not just for hungry Americans but for people around the world who rely on U.S. agriculture. Mr. Schundler’s wise words are also relevant to questions about reopening other facilities: All lives do matter. For obvious reasons Dr. Fauci focuses on the novel coronavirus. Here’s hoping that he will start giving more thought to other health threats as well. In the meantime, a bit of good news from the Tuesday hearing is that Dr.  Fauci reports that while      Donald Trump            respects his advice, the President  also “gets opinions from a variety of other people.” Thank God. *** Follow James Freeman on Twitter.

The Labor Department said the consumer-price index fell by 0.8% last month, the second month in a row prices have eased since the pandemic reached the U.S. and the biggest drop since 2008. Business closures and stay-home orders aimed at containing the virus have created cheap oil, and falling prices for air travel, clothing, car insurance and other goods and services. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, so-called core prices decreased 0.4%, the largest monthly drop in records dating to 1957. While the month-to-month drops in inflation notched records, annual prices only reached the lows of the last expansion. Overall prices were up 0.3% from a year earlier, the lowest since 2015, and core prices were 1.4% higher from a year ago, the lowest since 2011. Economists expect the decline in prices to be short-lived, with costs firming up as the U.S. reopens its economy and demand increases. Most don’t think the U.S. is likely to see price softness turn into a worst-case scenario as an extended period of deflation—when there are so many idle economic resources that businesses and workers are forced to lower prices and wages to generate demand for their goods and services. “With economic activity beginning to open up, even if in a halting manner, while prices may slip further, they are unlikely to do so to nearly the extent seen in April,” said Richard Moody, chief economist at Regions Financial Corp.

Parents and public health officials are understandably worried, but some perspective is in order given the virus’s apparent overall low risk to children. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported last week that 15 children under age 15 in the U.S. have died of Covid-19 since February compared to about 200 who died of the flu and pneumonia. Children represent 0.02% of virus fatalities in the U.S., and very few have been hospitalized. A study in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) Pediatrics last week found that only 48 children between March 14 and April 3 were admitted to 14 pediatric intensive care units in the U.S., and 83% had an underlying condition. The most common was “a long-term dependence on technological support (including tracheostomy) associated with developmental delay and/or genetic anomalies,” the authors note. The fatality rate for children in ICUs was 5% compared to 50% to 62% for adults. Another new JAMA study examines children treated for cancer at New York’s Memorial Sloan Kettering. Twenty of 178 pediatric patients tested positive for coronavirus—an infection rate of 11.2%—but only one required noncritical hospital care. Thirteen of their 74 adult caregivers also tested positive—an infection rate of 17.6%. “Together, our results do not support the conjecture that children are a reservoir of unrecognized SARS-CoV-2 infection,” the authors conclude. Children also appear at lower risk of infection based on population antibody studies, including a recent one from Spain that found a sharp age gradient. Just 1.1% of infants under age one carried antibodies; 2.2% of those between one and four; 3% between five and nine; 3.9% between 10 and 19; and 4.4% between 20 and 39. Antibodies were most prevalent (about 6%) in Spaniards 60 and older.  "

Slight declines in new confirmed cases in some states have prompted governors from New York to Ohio to restart some services, with rules varying from place to place, including restaurants, churches and schools. On Wednesday, Connecticut became one of the last states to loosen restrictions. Washington, D.C., remains under stay-at-home orders, and large parts of states, including major metropolitan areas, are still largely shut. In most states, the reopenings are happening in phases. Absent mandated federal guidelines, local leaders looking to reopen have weighed the potential costs to the economy and public health, relying on sources including virus data, task forces, public-health leaders and their own constituencies. A big question remaining is whether cases will go up as people re-emerge. Most states are moving to reopen before they have met criteria set by the Trump administration such as a two-week decline in the number of new cases or in the percentage of Covid-19 tests that are positive. The administration’s plan leaves the decision about when to reopen up to governors. Two states—Michigan and New Mexico—had met the criteria as of May 18, according to Covidexitstrategy.org, a tracking system run by a group of public-health and crisis experts. A few other states met the criteria in previous days but dropped back due to rising cases or declines in testing. The daily number of positive tests for Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, has risen or remained flat over the past two weeks in 24 states, according to Covidexitstrategy.org, a worrying sign for a disease that is highly transmissible and can cause deadly complications from head to toe. The disease is more contagious and deadlier than the flu, according to public health data from several countries. More than 1.55 million people in the U.S. have confirmed cases of the coronavirus, and over 93,000 deaths have been recorded, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University, including 1,485 between 8 p.m. Tuesday and the same time Wednesday, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis. World-wide, there are some 4.96 million confirmed infections, and more than 326,000 reported deaths. Experts caution that official numbers likely understate the extent of the pandemic in part because of limited and differing testing capabilities for the virus. Covid-19 can cause damage far beyond the lungs, affecting the brain, kidneys, heart, vascular and digestive systems. Some patients have sudden strokes, pulmonary emboli, or kidney failure. Children have developed an inflammatory condition resembling Kawasaki disease. Some people even develop “Covid toe,” a painful purplish swelling caused by blood clots. About 10% to 20% of people who are infected become severely ill and can develop such complications, according to public health data, though more population-wide testing is needed to determine the true percentage. Public-health officials fear a new wave of illnesses if states reopen too broadly, a move that could overwhelm hospital intensive care units. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released recommendations last weekend intended to help restaurants and bars, mass transit, and other sectors of the economy prevent transmission. Other public health experts are weighing in, too. Resolve to Save Lives, a nonprofit initiative of the global health organization Vital Strategies, released a color-coded alert system for local and state governments, as well as other countries. The system is based on seven indicators that rate a country or region’s risk from red (“very high risk”) to green (“new normal”). “It holds governments accountable for what they’re doing and what they’re reporting, and it accelerates progress toward a new normal where we’re safer,” said            Tom Frieden,      president and CEO of Resolve to Save Lives, and a former director of the CDC. “It’s not right to think of this as health versus economics.”  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has fast tracked the process for experimental vaccines, and drugmaker Moderna injected a dose of hope into the process earlier this week when it reported positive results from the first human study of its experimental coronavirus vaccine. Still, a viable candidate remains months away, with more time required to manufacture enough vaccine for the world’s population. Until then, public health officials say measures including more increased testing capabilities and robust contact-tracing programs are necessary for safely easing restrictions. But changing and often inconsistent information has hampered efforts to create a clear snapshot of how the U.S. is doing as a whole in its fight against the pandemic. The patchwork of state rules and regulations has further complicated the picture. Utah never issued a blanket stay-at-home order but placed different levels of restrictions on different counties. California was one of the earliest states to issue a stay-at-home order and only recently began relaxing restrictions, though curbs in Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area are expected to remain in place for some time. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp’s order late last month to allow nonessential businesses such as hair salons and gyms to open was one of the nation’s most aggressive reopenings. As states begin to reopen, governors and other leaders are having to navigate a host of new issues. They are thinking about the safety of reopened plants, open-plan offices and public transportation, confronting state budgets hit by sudden revenue shortages and figuring out how to conduct elections with social-distancing. In Michigan, that included natural disaster. Flooding in Midland County forced thousands to flee their homes after two dams breached.            Gov. Gretchen Whitmer,      who issued a state of emergency, encouraged people to continue to wear masks and practice social distancing to the best of their ability. “To go through this in the midst of a global pandemic is almost unthinkable,” the Democrat said. Ford Motor Co.      , meanwhile, stopped assembly lines at assembly plants in Chicago and Michigan, in a second straight day of disrupted output that highlighted challenges the auto industry they attempt to resume work during the Covid-19 outbreak. American companies have been reworking safety procedures to keep workers healthy as they return to the job, from changing floor plans to requiring regular health screenings at entrances and protective equipment. Ahead of the Michigan’s August primary and November general elections, state Secretary of State            Jocelyn Benson      said Tuesday that all registered voters would receive applications for absentee ballots in the mail. Nevada, meanwhile, plans to hold a mostly vote-by-mail primary election in June. President Trump threatened Wednesday to withhold federal funding from both states because of the moves, calling them illegal. While researchers have found rare instances of absentee-voter fraud, studies show it isn’t widespread. Georgia, Iowa and West Virginia also have recently chosen to automatically send absentee-ballot applications to voters. In Texas, a federal judge ruled Tuesday that voters who want to vote by mail because of the pandemic would be allowed to do so in the November elections. The state’s attorney general, a Republican, said he planned to appeal the decision. State governments estimate the collective expense of fighting the pandemic at some $45 billion; most want the federal government to repay in full, rather than be reimbursed at the 75% rate allowed under the law, the Federal Emergency Management Agency said. Organizations representing state, territorial and local governments asked Congress on Wednesday to approve an aid package that would help fund services and essential jobs as states, cities and counties face budget shortfalls. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott      on Wednesday asked state agencies and universities to reduce their budgets by 5% because of the “economic shock” caused by the pandemic. New York’s state government is holding back more than $1 billion of planned spending.            California Gov. Gavin Newsom,      who months ago announced a $5.6 billion budget surplus, has outlined a revised budget plan as the state anticipated a $54.3 billion hole in the current and coming fiscal years. As countries around the globe allow businesses and schools to reopen, officials are taking new precautions to mitigate any resurgence of infections. Germany, working to curb a string of coronavirus outbreaks in slaughterhouses and meatpacking plants, Wednesday imposed tougher hygiene inspection regimes and higher fines for breaching the rules. The country also moved to secure its own production of medical equipment and drugs, tightening a regulation that enables the government to veto takeover bids for German health-care companies. Get a coronavirus briefing six days a week, and a weekly Health newsletter once the crisis abates: Sign up here. In France, the government asked citizens and permanent residents returning from outside Europe to voluntarily submit to a 14-day quarantine. Spain will require face masks on anyone over the age 6 when outdoors or in enclosed public spaces, except where social distancing is possible. But there is no clear indication that the pandemic is retreating world-wide. Brazil posted a record daily high of 1,179 fatalities Tuesday. The nation now has the world’s third-largest total of confirmed infections, with more than 271,000. Medical experts say the numbers there aren’t likely to peak until June. Iran on Wednesday reported 2,346 new cases, the most in a day since the government began a slow reopening of society in mid-April. India also recorded a new daily high, with 5,611 confirmed cases on Tuesday. A fresh outbreak in China’s northeast, meanwhile, has driven the government to reimpose lockdown conditions across a number of cities in the provinces of Jilin, Liaoning and Heilongjiang.

Then one day, the nurse’s body started to ache. Ms. Barbosa de Oliveira, 56, grew fatigued, as a fever spiked. She had trouble urinating, started coughing and lost her sense of taste and smell. Gasping for breath, she was rushed to the Employees of São Paulo State Hospital where she worked, this time as a patient in intensive care. She tested positive for Covid-19, the illness caused by the new coronavirus, and died 21 days later, on May 7. “She loved her job,” said Selma de Araujo Vereda, recalling how her aunt doled out meaningful gestures for the elderly patients she cared for in the geriatrics ward, like getting them haircuts and body creams. “It was her mission to help others.” The coronavirus is spreading rapidly throughout Brazil, overwhelming a health care system that is ill prepared to handle a pandemic of this magnitude and proving especially deadly for the medical workers on the front lines. At least 116 nurses have died in this country of 210 million from Covid-19, according to Brazil’s Federal Nursing Council—the highest toll anywhere. That is more than the 107 nurses who have died in the U.S., where the total death count of people succumbing to the pandemic is about six times more than in Brazil. In Italy, which has about twice as many total deaths as Brazil, 39 nurses have died, according to Italy’s National Federation of Nurses, or Fnopi."

Facing higher costs to keep workers and customers safe and an indefinite period of suppressed demand, businesses are navigating an ever-narrower path to profitability. To make the math work, some businesses are cutting services and jobs. Others are raising prices, including imposing coronavirus-related fees aimed at getting customers to share some of the expenses. For large companies, the price—and perils—of operating in a pandemic are already coming into focus. Walmart Inc.,            Target Corp.      and            Home Depot Inc.      this week said they absorbed more than $2 billion combined in added expenses for wages, bonuses and other benefits for workers during the early months of the pandemic.            McDonald’s Corp.      laid out conditions for franchisees to reopen their dining rooms that include cleaning bathrooms every half-hour and digital kiosks after every order.            Ford Motor Co.      this week opened its American assembly plants for the first time in two months, and promptly had to idle factories in Michigan and Illinois after employees tested positive for Covid-19. The stakes can be higher for small businesses, which tend to operate on thinner profit margins and smaller cash reserves. As they begin to reopen after weeks of being shut down, they are confronting a cost-revenue ratio that is increasingly out of whack. Prices of food and other items have risen. Employees need protective equipment at work. Rising unemployment, safety concerns and limits on the number of customers a business is allowed to serve are setting a cap on sales. Some have tried to raise prices to bridge the divide, but greeting consumers who have been staying at home with higher costs is a delicate proposition. Billy Yuzar saw adding a surcharge to diners’ tabs as a simple way to compensate for higher food prices at his West Plains, Mo., restaurant, Kiko Japanese Steakhouse & Sushi Lounge. It was more convenient than raising menu prices, Mr. Yuzar said, because he could update the fee in the business’s point-of-sale computer in one step. Regular customers were supportive, he said, but when a photo of a Kiko receipt showing a Covid-19 surcharge surfaced on social media, people who had never been to his restaurant began calling to complain. “The people from this community and my actual customers don’t mind at all paying,” Mr. Yuzar said. “The backlash that I got is just because of these tweets.” Mr. Yuzar has removed the surcharge and raised menu prices. Other small businesses have stuck with the surcharge strategy. Herman Halici, the owner of Dan’s Super Subs in Woodland Hills, Calif., said the price of meats such as pastrami, roast beef and corned beef has risen by up to 60%, and new procedures mean that employees must spend 25% more time on cleaning. In response, the shop has added a surcharge of 75 cents to $1 a sandwich. Most customers have been understanding, Mr. Halici said. “Out of a hundred people, maybe two complain about it,” Mr. Halici said. “Unlike before, everyone goes to the grocery store now, so they understand about the meat prices.” Some states have cracked down on price gouging during the pandemic, but Covid-19 surcharges don’t appear to have drawn many official complaints. A spokesman for New York’s attorney general said the office hasn’t received any complaints about surcharges, while a spokesman for Missouri’s attorney general said the office has gotten one out of 1,501 total price-gouging complaints. A surcharge has helped Melissa Aviles grapple with higher costs and lower capacity at her salon, Studio M, in Amelia Court House, Va. After reopening, it can only host one customer at a time, so she can do just four hair-color appointments and one haircut a day, compared with eight to 10 appointments in normal times. Finding supplies such as Lysol also has been a challenge because of high demand. Ms. Aviles said one customer questioned Studio M’s new $3 sanitation surcharge but was understanding once she explained the rationale. “I’m fortunate that I live in a small town, and I’m close with my clients,” Ms. Aviles said. Costs are rising for health-care practices too, leading some to consider adding fees. Jeff Shapiro, a dentist with a practice in Manhattan’s financial district, has always worn a surgical mask while he works but has switched to pricier N95 masks following industry recommendations. He now also dons a face shield and disposable gown for each appointment, and said his office may spend tens of thousands of dollars on improved air-filtration systems. He estimated his costs have risen by $25 to $50 for a patient visit. “I think patients would be understanding, if not happy about it,” Dr. Shapiro said regarding the possibility of a surcharge. “If you don’t do this stuff, the ramifications can be far worse.” The pricing strategy also has landed at large package carriers, with            United Parcel Service Inc.,      FedEx Corp. and DHL Express applying surcharges for some international shipping during the pandemic. DHL Express said its costs have risen in part because cargo space it buys on commercial airliners has become scarce because of flight reductions. A spokeswoman said it has added an emergency-situation surcharge during the pandemic on some levels of international shipping service, with exemptions for packages that support health-care purposes. UPS has been applying a fee it calls a “peak surcharge” on international shipments since April 12. The charges top out at $1.81 a pound on express shipments from China, where the novel coronavirus outbreak began late last year, to the U.S., which has the world’s highest number of confirmed cases. “The peak surcharges, which apply to international shipments, reflect the current dynamic market conditions and uncertainties caused by the coronavirus,” a UPS spokesman said.

Press reports describe the investigation as “independent,” but it’s too soon to know if the probe will be free from political pressure. The European Union and Australia led the push for an inquiry, which is set to begin “at the earliest appropriate moment.” Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison deserves particular praise for standing firm amid Chinese bullying. Beijing has imposed tariffs on Australian barley and suspended imports of beef over Mr. Morrison’s push for a probe. China’s state-run media are spinning this as a win for China, since specific Australian language about Beijing’s role has been removed. “It is a totally different thing from the so-called independent inquiry pushed by the Australian side,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said Tuesday. Mr. Zhao, famous for promoting a conspiracy theory about the pandemic’s origin, is compensating for what is a political defeat for Beijing. The resolution calls for an “impartial, independent and comprehensive evaluation,” and China signed on only after more than 120 nations backed the resolution Monday night. China won a small victory over the resolution’s language, but Covid-19’s Chinese roots inevitably should come up. Even if the Chinese government is uncooperative, the world already knows enough about its early fumbles to earn criticism in an independent inquiry. WHO bureaucrats argue that it’s too soon to begin a review with the crisis at full tilt and staff occupied. No one is suggesting director-general Tedros Ghebreyesus should spend next week being deposed, but a few steps can be taken now to get the probe rolling and ensure impartiality. If this really is an independent investigation, WHO officials dealing with the crisis needn’t be involved in these early steps.  "

Gilead Sciences Inc.  is ramping up production of the drug, remdesivir, which moderately sped recovery for hospitalized patients in a federal study—though it isn’t known whether the drug can prevent death from the disease, which is caused by the new coronavirus. The company is donating early supplies to the federal government in the U.S., which is allocating it to states. Food and Drug Administration criteria for remdesivir use under its May 1 emergency authorization are broad, doctors say, and little published research points to who might benefit most. States and counties, which are allocating the drug to hospitals, are devising widely different methods of awarding the scarce supply. Hospitals, too, use different methods to decide who to treat. That means a patient who qualifies in one locale might be shut out in another. “We’re in a situation of scarcity and we have to find a fair way to allocate this scarce resource,” said Doug White, a doctor and ethicist at the University of Pittsburgh. Hospitals affiliated with the University of Pittsburgh decide who gets the drug by lottery—though not a totally random one. It is designed to slightly boost chances of patients from economically distressed neighborhoods. “Random lotteries will simply propagate disparities,” said Dr. White, who helped develop the system.

According to a form posted on the CDC website, the information only has to go back to the week leading up to their first filing, which was supposed to occur by May 17, while older data is optional. Nursing homes will provide current data at least weekly going forward. An earlier version of the CDC form, from April, told nursing homes to provide initial data going back to Jan. 1, according to a copy viewed by The Wall Street Journal. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which issued the rule, said that it didn’t require nursing homes to submit earlier data but it encouraged them to do so.

All participants will get regular temperature checks, masks and hand sanitizer; contact with court staff will be limited, and surfaces are to be regularly disinfected. “You have some absolute constitutional rights that defendants have—a jury of 12 people, from their community, in a timely fashion,” District Court Judge Matthew J. Cuffe said. At the same time, prospective jurors “have the right to a clean, healthy and safe environment.” These extraordinary measures—in a sparsely populated state with the second-lowest confirmed number of Covid-19 cases—illustrate the challenges facing courts around the U.S. as they try to resume jury trials during a public-health crisis. Nationwide lockdowns have put a near total halt to jury trials, a bedrock of the American justice system. Jury service, by its nature, brings together large groups of people, often into cramped quarters, before sending them back home. Operating under emergency orders during the coronavirus pandemic, most state and federal courts have conducted arraignments, oral arguments and even drug courts by video or teleconference.  "

Governments are starting to lift their lockdowns, but Americans and the rest of the world will need an effective vaccine—and maybe several—for a return to pre-virus normality. It took 20 months for scientists to prepare a SARS vaccine for test on humans, but private innovation is compressing the time-frame against Covid-19. Using rapid genetic sequencing and its nimble mRNA manufacturing platform, Moderna was able to develop and deliver a vaccine to the National Institutes of Health for clinical trials in late February. Moderna’s mRNA vaccine gives cells a building manual to produce a particle that resembles the spike on the coronavirus. The goal is to induce an antibody response similar to the actual virus. Because the vaccine doesn’t utilize a pathogen particle, there are fewer safety risks. Production can also rapidly be scaled up using a standardized process. The first phase of a clinical trial examining whether the vaccine is safe and causes an immune response began in mid-March. Forty-five healthy volunteers ages 18 to 55 received varying doses. Moderna reported on Monday that all participants who had been evaluated after receiving two doses developed antibody levels at or above levels of those seen in patients who have recovered from the virus. This suggests that the vaccine could be effective, and none of the participants experienced severe side effects. Separately, Moderna reported that its vaccine “provided full protection against viral replication in the lungs” in mice infected with the coronavirus. On May 7, the Food and Drug Administration cleared the company to begin phase two of its trial with 600 participants including individuals over age 55 to determine whether they also muster a robust immune response. On May 12 the FDA granted Moderna fast-track designation, and the company plans to begin the third phase of its trial to assess the vaccine’s efficacy in thousands of people in July. A vaccine could be made available for high-priority groups such as health-care workers as early as the fall if results show promise. Historically only 16% of vaccines that begin clinical trials have been approved. But more than 100 vaccines are in development worldwide, and the Gates Foundation and the National Institutes of Health are investing heavily to accelerate those like Moderna’s with the most scientific potential based on early evidence. Scaling up manufacturing will take time, but Moderna’s factory outside Boston can produce 100 million doses a year and it is working with Swiss firm            Lonza      to increase capacity to up to one billion doses. Other drug manufacturers are also gearing up factories to churn out vaccines if their candidates show promise. Johnson & Johnson      plans to begin clinical trials in September and says it hopes that the first batches could be made available for emergency use early next year. Its Netherlands plant could produce 300 million doses annually.            Pfizer      is also testing several vaccine candidates and hopes to have 10 to 20 million doses ready for emergency use this fall. The FDA could help by streamlining trial designs such as allowing manufacturers to increase participation in studies, or dose “arms,” with strong preliminary results. This wouldn’t compromise safety, and the death and destruction from the virus have removed some of the political obstacles to faster testing. Thirty-five House Democrats and Republicans last month wrote a letter urging the FDA to act more rapidly and nimbly. Relaxing lockdowns and social-distancing mandates will also be needed since masses of people will have to be exposed to the virus for manufacturers to figure out if vaccines work. Until a vaccine is widely available, large gatherings may not occur, international travel will be limited, and millions of people will feel anxious about returning to pre-virus habits. Which is why markets are cheering on Moderna, despite the uncertainties that remain, and Americans should be too. Copyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Amid the coronavirus pandemic, this work has thankfully continued. In reaction to Covid-19, federal agencies and departments have taken more than 600 regulatory actions, many of them temporary, per the White House’s tally. Truck drivers hauling emergency supplies have more flexibility about hours on the road. Seniors on Medicare can consult doctors by iPhone. Colleges can ramp up distance learning without the usual red tape. On Tuesday the Administration entered the next phase of pandemic deregulation. At a cabinet meeting, President Trump signed an executive order telling government agencies to “combat the economic consequences of COVID-19 with the same vigor and resourcefulness with which the fight against COVID-19 itself has been waged.” This means going on the hunt for rules “that may inhibit economic recovery.” The order says the government should “give businesses, especially small businesses, the confidence they need to re-open by providing guidance on what the law requires.” It suggests that the bureaucracy—say, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration—decline to take enforcement action against companies that “have attempted in reasonable good faith” to meet the applicable regulations or the guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Meantime, agencies are directed to review their 600 pandemic regulatory actions “and determine which, if any, would promote economic recovery if made permanent.” In some instances, such as for the waivers allowing Medicare patients to dial a doctor from home, this might require congressional action.

In a Monday letter to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Mr. Trump said the organization has shown an “alarming lack of independence” from Beijing and failed to adequately respond to the coronavirus pandemic. “It is clear the repeated missteps by you and your organization in responding to the pandemic have been extremely costly for the world,” Mr. Trump wrote. “The only way forward for the World Health Organization is if it can actually demonstrate independence from China.” Mr. Trump touted the letter on his  Twitter  account on Monday night. “It is self-explanatory!” he wrote. The White House didn’t respond to a request for comment seeking information on the changes Mr. Trump would like to see the WHO make. The president had suspended contributions to the group in April pending an internal review of the WHO’s response to the pandemic. The four-page letter details the results of that review.  "

The company said the vaccine induced immune responses in some of the healthy volunteers who were vaccinated, and the shots were generally safe and well-tolerated. The results offered a preliminary but promising sign about one of the most advanced coronavirus vaccines in development, and suggested Moderna was on track to meet its ambitious timetable for producing it for possible emergency use in the fall. The vaccine still has much to prove. The results don’t show whether it actually protects people who are exposed to the new coronavirus, a key proof point. Many vaccines fail to pass muster even after showing positive signs in early testing. Yet the initial results for Moderna’s closely watched vaccine buoyed optimism. Moderna shares were up about 20% in afternoon trading Monday, helping to lift the broader market. The S&P 500 gained 3.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 899 points, or 3.8%, in New York trading.  "

The theory is that banning mass public events where hundreds of attendees can infect themselves in the space of a few hours, along with other measures such as wearing face masks, might slow the pace of the new coronavirus’s progression to a manageable level even as shops and factories reopen. Researchers believe the explosive growth of coronavirus infections that overwhelmed hospitals in some countries was primarily driven by such events  this year—horse races in Britain, carnival festivities in the U.S. and Germany or a soccer match in Italy. The study of superspreading events could help scientists better understand how the virus can propagate in crowded conditions—in offices, schools, churches, gyms and public transportation—and guide governments in regulating such public occasions as weddings, trade conferences and sporting events. There is little doubt about the mechanisms involved in superspreading events. A study published by the National Academy of Sciences in the U.S. last week found that one minute of loud speech was enough to produce thousands of droplets that remain airborne for about 12 minutes, potentially able to infect anyone in the area. Similar studies have shown that virus-laden aerosols, particles smaller than droplets, can levitate for hours after being released in indoor spaces.

Chief Executive      Mark Zuckerberg            on Thursday announced plans to reconfigure operations over the next decade to enable up to half of its 45,000 employees to work from home. The move follows an announcement last week by            Twitter Inc.      to allow employees to work from home indefinitely. E-commerce company            Shopify Inc.      on Thursday also said it plans to let most employees work remotely in the future. The Morning Download delivers daily insights and news on business technology from the CIO Journal team. Remarking on Facebook’s plans,            Aaron Levie,      CEO and co-founder of cloud company            Box Inc.,      said in a tweet: “Just as Intel, HP, and others originally defined how we operated for decades in tech, we’ll see a redefinition for the 21st century by new digital companies.” From the open office to agile development, trends in the tech sector have a way of percolating into the broader corporate world. Some companies outside tech are following suit in the move to permanent remote work. Before the coronavirus hit, marketing and advertising mogul            Martin Sorrell      thought that the leased office spaces and WeWork footprint at his London-based media company            S4 Capital      PLC were necessary. But he reassessed that about a month into the wide-ranging lockdowns that have thrust everyday business online. ”We are breaking our leases and thinking about having people spend more time at home,” he said. More than 80% of enterprise-technology providers said corporate customers last month were shopping for communications, collaboration and other remote-work tools, up from 76% in March, according to a survey of more than 200 U.S. tech firms by IT industry trade group CompTIA. LinkedIn Corp. executives are also seeing emerging trends that show remote work might become more widely accepted, said            Karin Kimbrough,      chief economist at the Microsoft Corp. subsidiary. In the past month, LinkedIn recorded a 28% increase in remote job postings and a 42% increase in searches using the terms “remote” or “work from home,” Ms. Kimbrough said at a recent web conference. Large tech providers are betting that demand for remote-work and business-continuity tools will continue after regional lockdowns are lifted, industry analysts say. That is expected to drive a surge in acquisitions by big enterprise IT providers on the hunt for startups developing collaboration, access management and other capabilities aimed at supporting a dispersed workforce. “The scale that we have implemented and the ongoing reliance on remote worker technology will be permanent, and it is largely the business processes that may be evaluated for potential changes,” said            Nigel Faulkner,      chief technology officer at investment firm            T. Rowe Price Group Inc.,      in an email. Mr. Faulkner said that in the future, his team will be more focused on providing the underlying technology to support both productivity and flexibility for employees working from home.  Craig Malloy,      CEO of software company LifeSize, said the response to the pandemic has revealed the viability of remote work for many businesses that had access to the necessary technology, but were hesitant to expand the practice. “This is the tipping point for widespread remote work and we expect to see employers continuing to enable permanent work-from-home arrangements for distributed teams,” Mr. Malloy said. That transition will need to go beyond sticking with emergency measures put in place to keep businesses running amid regional lockdowns, said            Darren Murph,      head of remote at software developer GitLab Inc., where everyone works remotely. “What we’re experiencing now isn’t truly intentional remote work, it’s crisis-induced work from home,” Mr. Murph said. But due to the emergency measures, companies will come to realize that a dispersed workforce is a far more efficient and productive way of doing business, and many will be prompted to install more permanent remote-work infrastructure and applications, Mr. Murph said. “The current crisis has accelerated the adoption of remote work by at least 10 years,” he said. —Steven Rosenbush and Tom Loftus contributed to this article.

The plan, which the Facebook chief executive laid out in detail to employees in livestreamed remarks on Thursday, is one of the highest-profile examples of business leaders committing to extend the practices their companies quickly embraced to adjust to the crisis. On matters from workplace to strategy, managers are rethinking what works and shifting course, sometimes long term. The remote-work changes for new hires will roll out initially in the U.S. and apply only to senior engineers at first. With individual team leaders’ approval, new recruits will be offered the choice to work from home, and current employees around the world with strong performance reviews will be able to apply to do so. In time, the policy will be extended to employees outside Facebook’s engineering department. Within 10 years, Mr. Zuckerberg expects as much as half of Facebook’s employees—who currently number more than 45,000—to work from home, he said in an interview before the announcement. Mr. Zuckerberg said Facebook is moving gradually because the shift will require new techniques and tools to compensate for the loss of in-person office interactions—a challenge for which he said the company is well-positioned given its focus on using technology to connect people.

Comparable sales, those that come through stores or digital channels operating for at least 12 months, rose 10.8% for the quarter ended May 2. Digital sales rose 141%, growing each month during the quarter, while comparable-store sales increased less than 1% in the period. “Last quarter was unlike anything I’ve ever seen,” Target Chief Executive Brian Cornell said on a call with reporters. “It was intense. It was volatile. It was stressful for our guests and for the country.” Mr. Cornell said the retailer saw a drop-off in store traffic when shelter-in-place orders went into effect in the middle of the quarter. By the middle of April, he said, there was “a rapid increase in traffic and sales” driven by a surge in discretionary categories such as apparel and kitchenware. Electronics, grocery and beauty-product sales grew fastest overall, he said. The Minneapolis-based company benefited from government stimulus checks sent to many Americans as well as from shoppers returning to stores in the first wave of states that reopened for business, Mr. Cornell said.

The only precedent for its rapid spread to every continent, killing people everywhere and devastating both local economies and world trade, was the flu pandemic of 1918-19. In both cases, the germs behind the pandemic weren’t especially lethal. Covid-19 and the flu both fall within the normal range of mild infectious diseases. Compared with smallpox and Ebola, they kill only a small percentage of their victims, and their person-to-person transmissibility isn’t unusual. What sets them apart—what has made them world-wide pandemics—is modern transportation: fast steamships for the flu, and now jet airplanes for Covid-19. Of course, there have been a great many “mere” epidemics in human history, diseases that have spread more slowly over large areas, but their effects have been profound. Over the course of recorded history and now in the archaeological record, examples abound of germs producing high death tolls and social and political upheaval, with far-reaching effects on local economies, trade, migration, colonization and conquest. Will Covid-19 transform our own era, too? Are we entering an age of pandemics? It is far too early to say, but the long history of germs as agents of historical change can provide needed perspective—and perhaps a window into how Covid-19 and its likely successors may shape our destiny, for good and ill. Consider first a familiar case: the plague bacterium, which was transmitted from rodents to humans by fleas, and spread from Asia into Europe in the 14th century. The Black Death killed about a third of Europe’s population in the years 1347-51 and recurred with lower death tolls for many decades thereafter.  "

The unpersuasive answers suggest there’s more to learn. Take Joe Biden, who “unmasked” Mr. Flynn only a few days before leaving office as Vice President. Last week Mr. Biden told ABC that he knew “nothing about those moves to investigate Michael Flynn.” George Stephanopoulos reminded Mr. Biden that he attended a Jan. 5, 2017 Oval Office meeting when the FBI’s Flynn investigation was discussed. Mr. Biden replied that he’d misheard the question and admitted he was “aware that there was, that they’d asked for, an investigation. But that’s all I know about it.” This was more straightforward than what Mr. Biden told MSNBC when he was asked about his “involvement in the investigation of Michael Flynn.” Mr. Biden replied: “I was never a part or had any knowledge of any criminal investigation into Flynn while I was in office.” Except at the time there was no criminal investigation into Mr. Flynn—as Mr. Biden knows. In 2016 The FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation into Mr. Flynn, and it was under that pretense that it conducted the interview in which it later claimed that Mr. Flynn lied. The lack of a criminal investigation is the primary reason the Justice Department moved this month to drop its prosecution. Mr. Biden still hasn’t explained why he personally unmasked Mr. Flynn. James Clapper, the former director of national intelligence, defended his unmasking of Mr. Flynn as “perfectly legitimate.” Mr. Clapper told CNN that he had a professional duty to investigate the “numerous engagements by representatives of the Trump camp with Russians.” As he told Sirius XM’s “The Joe Madison Show”: “People would be derelict if they didn’t have enough curiosity to inquire what was going on.”  "

The tests are seen as key to easing lockdowns that have shut down economies around the world. However, while surging demand has proven a boon for the traders known as blood brokers who source this commodity, diagnostic companies say high prices for the blood of recovered Covid-19 patients are posing a hurdle to developing tests. “We’ve had a terrible time trying to obtain positive specimens at a decent rate,” said Stefanie Lenart-Dallezotte, manager of business operations for San Diego-based Epitope Diagnostics Inc., which sells an antibody test for Covid-19. “I feel people are taking extreme advantage of the situation because they can, because there’s crazy demand.” She said one broker quoted $1,000 for a one-milliliter sample of convalescent plasma, a term for the antibody-containing part of the blood from recovered patients."

Genesis Healthcare Inc.  said in an earnings call Wednesday that it had seen cases of Covid-19, the coronavirus illness, in 187 of its 361 facilities, largely concentrated in five Eastern states with heavy community spread of the virus. Throughout the industry, the coronavirus has swelled costs for staffing and protective medical gear while limiting admissions of patients recovering from surgical procedures, which help pay the bills. The impact has been softened by the federal government’s aid packages, including nearly $4.9 billion it recently began distributing to nursing homes. Genesis, which saw its first Covid-19 case on March 16, said the pandemic’s impact on its first-quarter results was limited, as the company swung to a net profit of $33.5 million, on revenue of $1.09 billion, from a loss of $15.3 million and revenue of $1.16 billion in the year-earlier quarter. The recent quarter’s results were helped by transactions, including the divestiture of some facilities, that resulted in a net gain of $84.8 million. But more recently, the company said, average occupancy in its nursing homes would drop to a projected 76% in May from 88.2% in the first quarter.

Employees at Smithfield Foods Inc.,  Ford Motor Co.  and  UnitedHealth Group Inc.  have begun reporting to tents and clinics or getting kits in the mail for coronavirus testing. The tests, combined with mandatory face masks and social-distancing practices on the job, are intended to protect staff and provide managers with a real-time sense of the virus’s presence in their ranks. Yet long waits for results—up to 72 hours—and an uncertain timetable for when rapid-result testing will reach most workplaces, mean that companies’ grasp on workers’ health remains imperfect at best, even with costly testing. Employers are puzzling over whom to test, and how often, particularly given that tests typically cost $100 or more each. Companies should test enough to catch problems early, but not so often that logistics outweigh the benefits, said Raj Behal, chief quality officer at primary-care chain One Medical, which counted Google Inc. among its prepandemic clients. He advises clients to consider the size of a worker population, and whether workers must be near others on the job. Businesses that stayed open during the pandemic mainly focused testing on sick workers and sites with outbreaks. Now more companies plan to regularly test asymptomatic workers, corporate medical consultants say.  "

Yet diagnostics experts estimate wide access to quality rapid tests is still months away. Among the challenges is finding noninvasive ways to collect the patient sample while maintaining the sensitivity of current standard tests. The nasalpharyngeal swabs used in most current Covid-19 tests are invasive and difficult to successfully conduct in a home setting. The industry is trying to move quickly, especially before flu season arrives in the fall. That is when public-health experts worry about another surge of Covid-19 cases, and the ability to quickly distinguish between respiratory illnesses would become even more crucial.  "

This can be done through mobile devices and wearable headsets such as            Microsoft Corp.’s      HoloLens. Companies for several years have been experimenting with early versions of the technology to design objects such as automobiles and to receive step-by-step manufacturing instructions. The pandemic has increased those use cases to include remote assistance and training because employees and customers are less willing to be in close contact, said J.P. Gownder, vice president and principal analyst at Forrester Research Inc. Since March, Sheba Medical Center has used five HoloLens 2 headsets to train about 60 physicians, biomedical engineers and nurses on how to operate ventilators for Covid-19 patients, said Ravid Segal, chief technology officer of the MSR - The Israel Center for Medical Simulation, located at Sheba Medical Center. The HoloLens headset uses computer processing and optical projection systems to create digital hologram-like objects that users can see and interact with in their real environment. The Morning Download delivers daily insights and news on business technology from the CIO Journal team. In the Sheba Medical Center scenario, medical workers wearing the headset can see a hologram-like rendering of a ventilator superimposed on their real-world view. The headset includes built-in instructions that guide the worker through the process of operating the physical ventilator in front of them. The headset can also be used as a way for doctors in other parts of the hospital to give remote assistance without needing to be physically present but still being able to see what is happening in a patient’s room. Users wearing the headset can connect to a real-time video feed of a doctor in a separate wing of the hospital, which is displayed to the user as a digital image floating in the real-world room. The doctor, using either a HoloLens headset or a mobile device, can also see what the user is seeing in real time. Before the pandemic, the medical center had already planned to explore the use of augmented reality this year, said Eyal Zimlichman, chief innovation officer at Sheba Medical Center. “With Covid, it reinforced our decision [to use augmented reality] and the understanding that this is a critical tool in health care,” Dr. Zimlichman said. Microsoft has seen a 13-fold increase in remote assistance usage on HoloLens 2 since January, largely because of social-distancing and lockdown requirements amid the pandemic, said Charlie Han, principal program manager for Microsoft HoloLens. The number of U.S. employees expected to wear augmented and so-called mixed reality headsets is projected to reach 8.6 million by 2028, up from 25,000 in 2019, according to a November 2019 report by Forrester. The research firm refers to the virtual overlay of hologram-like, interactive objects onto a user’s view of the real world as “mixed reality,” while the term “augmented reality” refers to static images superimposed onto a user’s view of the real world. Enterprise adoption of the technology could accelerate in the coming years as companies realize the value of the technology, meaning the forecast could change, Forrester’s Mr. Gownder said. “We have seen a huge increase in enterprise interest in augmented and mixed reality during the pandemic,” he said in an email. Broadband internet company Cox Communications in March rolled out augmented reality technology to its workforce of more than 5,000 people including home technicians and contractors. “It’s absolutely essential to how we’re operating,” said Len Barlik, chief operations officer. Customers who need help installing internet service, plugging in a modem or setting up WiFi and passwords receive an email or text message with a link to start a virtual call through a software program from Alabama-based technology company Help Lightning Inc. When customers click on the link using a phone or tablet with a built-in camera, a technician can talk them through the set-up process while being able to see what the customer is seeing. The technician can “draw” a circle or arrow around a particular object, such as a cable, that the customer will be able to see. Technicians normally have to go inside customers’ homes to perform such service or troubleshooting requests, but the pandemic and social-distancing requirements have prevented that from happening in various states, Mr. Barlik said. Cox had explored the idea of using the technology in customer service experiments before this year, but the pandemic accelerated the use case for it, Mr. Barlik said. The Help Lightning technology is currently available only for residential customers but will continue to be used after the pandemic subsides and could be expanded to business customers, he said. Servicing customers via augmented reality can save the company money and time that would otherwise be spent on driving from house to house, Mr. Barlik said. “We’ll definitely continue to utilize it,” he said. Help Lightning saw 435% growth in customers using its technology to conduct thousands of calls related to remote assistance between February and April because of the pandemic, said Gary York, chief executive of the company.

But an emerging cultural and economic time bomb is about to explode. There has never been a wider gap between average Americans’ perception of their own economic situation and the reality of it. America could soon have its most combustible political environment in recent history. Something that should alarm everyone: Neither the stock market nor the political preferences of those who have been hit hardest by this Covid-induced economic crisis have fundamentally changed since the crisis began. The American economy has shed more than 30 million jobs in the past eight weeks, and poll numbers haven’t moved an inch. According to Gallup, President Trump’s approval rating was 49% on Feb. 16, with 48% disapproving. Three months and the largest job loss in American history later, those numbers are exactly the same: 49% to 48%. How is that possible? Is the political climate so partisan that the loss of your livelihood can’t change your political perspective? To some extent that could be true. But most of America is living in an illusion that masks the inevitable pain of this pandemic. To the credit of the president and Congress, the Cares Act was passed before many Americans missed paychecks. The administration distributed the cash quickly enough that Americans had access to expanded unemployment compensation and a direct payment before their financial situation became dire. For the 40% of people making under $40,000 who have lost their jobs since March, according to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, the Cares Act ensured that their financial situation isn’t worse than it was in February. In some cases, it’s better, thanks to the $600-a-week unemployment bonus. Much of economically vulnerable America has been insulated from economic reality. A recent Washington Post poll shows that 77% of those who lost their jobs believe they will be heading back to the same jobs following the health crisis. Pew Research reports that 68% of Americans who lost their jobs are concerned about reopening the economy too early, rather than too late.  "

The affliction that’s come to be known as “Zoom fatigue” is way more than a byproduct of too many meetings. Social scientists say it’s the result of the sudden mass adoption of technology that’s disrupting the normal, instinctual and finely-tuned way of communicating that developed to help humans survive.  “We’ve evolved to get meaning out of a flick of the eye. Our species has survived because we can produce those signals in a way that’s meaningful,” says Jeremy Bailenson, professor and director of Stanford University’s Virtual Human Interaction Lab. “Zoom smothers you with cues, and they aren’t synchronous.

It’s very problematic,” says Bruce J. Schwartz, deputy chair and professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Montefiore Medical Center in New York. “Many people do develop a dependency on these medications.” Prescriptions for anti-anxiety medications, such as Klonopin and Ativan, rose 10.2% in the U.S. to 9.7 million in March 2020 from 8.8 million in March 2019, according to the latest data from health-research firm IQVIA. Prescriptions for antidepressants, including Prozac and Lexapro, rose 9.2% to 29.7 million from 27.2 million in the same period. The information doesn’t include data on whether dosages have increased along with prescriptions. “        ‘If you’ve lost your job, if you’re worried if you’ll have enough food for your kids, that will keep you up at night.’         ” Some companies have seen more dramatic increases. Express Scripts, a pharmacy benefit manager owned by            Cigna,      says prescriptions for anti-anxiety medications rose 34.1% between mid-February and mid-March, while prescriptions for antidepressants and sleep medications increased 18.6% and 14.8%, respectively. Ginger, which supplies video- and chat-based mental health services to companies, says its psychiatrists wrote 86% more prescriptions for psychotropic drugs, primarily antidepressants, in March and April 2020 compared with January and February. Health concerns, social isolation and the stress of job losses are taking a toll on people’s well-being. More than one-third of Americans say the pandemic is having a “serious impact” on their mental health, according to a survey released March 25 by the American Psychiatric Association. Among parents with children under 18, 46% rated their average stress level related to the pandemic as 8, 9 or 10 on a 10-point scale, according to a survey the American Psychological Association released May 21. The nation’s top mental-health official recently warned that the suffering could deepen if there were a second coronavirus lockdown. “This kind of chronic stress brings about, for all those people who have never had anxiety before, it sort of overwhelms them,” says Charles B. Nemeroff, professor and chair of the department of psychiatry at Dell Medical School at the University of Texas at Austin and president-elect of the Anxiety and Depression Association of America. “If you’ve lost your job, if you’re worried if you’ll have enough food for your kids, that will keep you up at night.” And for those with a history of anxiety and depression, stress can raise the risk of a relapse. The most popular anti-anxiety medications are benzodiazepines that include Valium, Xanax, Ativan and Klonopin. These drugs enhance the activity of the central nervous system’s main inhibitory neurotransmitter, GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid). GABA’s primary function is to reduce the activity of neurons. “They are powerful, and they are powerfully attractive in that they work instantly,” says James Potash, director of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Johns Hopkins Medicine. “You take Ativan, and 30 minutes later you are feeling dramatically less anxious.” Sleep medications like Lunesta and Ambien are similar to the benzodiazepines in that they also alter the activity of GABA. The neurotransmitter is thought to facilitate sleep. Doctors say that benzodiazepines can be a useful tool and are very effective for the short-term treatment of acute anxiety. Dr. Potash advises patients to limit their use to weeks, not months. The problem, he says, is that people can quickly develop a tolerance to their effects—sometimes in as little as two weeks—which can lead patients to increase the dose. This is especially the case with the shorter-acting drugs like Xanax, which are also abused as street drugs. The medications can be difficult to stop, too. Withdrawal symptoms can include a surge in anxiety, tremors and, in some cases, seizures. The medications can be particularly dangerous for older adults: In seniors, their use is associated with falls and cognitive problems. Because benzodiazepines can reduce the body’s drive to breathe, overdoses can be deadly. That is especially true when they are combined with alcohol and opioids. Overdose deaths involving benzodiazepines more than quadrupled between 1999 and 2013, according to a study published in 2016 in the American Journal of Public Health. People can also develop a psychological dependence, says Beth Salcedo, a psychiatrist in Washington, D.C., and the past president of the Anxiety and Depression Association of America. “If you have a boatload of Xanax, and you are slightly anxious, and you take one, you feel better. Next time you are anxious, instead of taking care of what is making you anxious, you’re much more likely to reach for the Xanax,” she says. “It can very quickly become a habit.” Dr. Salcedo recommends taking other steps to address anxiety, including “exercising, eating well, avoiding alcohol and making sure we surround ourselves with our social support as much as possible.” If anxiety is interfering with work or relationships, she advises turning to the most evidence-based treatments for anxiety disorders, which are cognitive behavioral therapy, a type of talk therapy, and antidepressant medications like Lexapro and Prozac. Since it can take several weeks for the effects of antidepressant medication or therapy to kick in, some doctors will use benzodiazepines briefly in the beginning of treatment to provide patients with immediate relief. Doctors have some of the same concerns with common sleep medications like Ambien and Lunesta as they do with the benzodiazepines, particularly when taken long term: They can be dangerous when combined with alcohol, and there are worries they can be addictive and abused. The drugs also come with side effects like daytime drowsiness, sometimes called the hangover effect. For chronic sleep problems, experts recommend first trying cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, known as CBT-I. It typically includes “sleep restriction,” or limiting the amount of time people spend in bed when they are unable to sleep, and “stimulus control,” which means keeping the bedroom dedicated to sleep and sex. “Changing behavior is usually a healthier approach,” says Dr. Potash. “It is pretty much all upside and very little downside.” Write to Andrea Petersen at andrea.petersen@wsj.com Have you felt increased anxiety or stress during the pandemic?

Today in all 50 states, the experience with coronavirus has peaked, plateaued or fallen, and the time has arrived to start identifying lessons learned. The past week’s events have revealed one rule of thumb: Whether the order comes from political leaders, epidemiologists or the media, you can get away with forcing the U.S. to shut down for about three months, but that’s it. Then the tides of human nature will push past the voices of authority. For better or worse, that’s just the way it is. We all saw the videos of the past weekend’s blowout at the Lake of the Ozarks pool party in Missouri—hundreds of cheerful people who looked like they’d already spent two months indoors drinking too much beer. The social-distancing hawks said it was an awful precedent, and maybe it was over the top, but consider this not unrelated headline in Crain’s New York Business, which didn’t go viral: “These city businesses plan to reopen Tuesday, without permission.” Despite the grim Covid reality in New York City, a coalition of some 300 small businesses, called Re-Open New York, opened their doors  Tuesday. On cue, the city’s “progressive” Mayor Bill de Blasio promised Wednesday  to hammer these shop owners with police visits to compel compliance.  Welcome to Nicaragua north. Simcha Minkowitz, who owns a jewelry store in Brooklyn, told Crain’s: “It doesn’t make sense.

Four months later, the densely packed Asian metropolises, with a combined population of about 13 million, have seen 27 fatalities between them. Just 0.4% of those with confirmed infections have died in Hong Kong. In Singapore—less than 0.1%. If the U.S. had a similar fatality rate as the average of the two, its death toll would now stand at about 4,100, rather than 98,000 and growing. “When you overwhelm health systems a lot more people die,” said David Owens, founder of Hong Kong medical practice OT&P Healthcare, who has treated patients for Covid-19. Hong Kong and Singapore “didn’t let the epidemic run wild.” The cities’ fatality rates—among the lowest in the world—show that coronavirus outbreaks don’t have to result in large-scale loss of life. Their playbook: test widely, quarantine aggressively and treat patients early to avoid fatal complications and overburdened health systems. Both Hong Kong and Singapore acted quickly to keep the outbreak in check, giving them enough lead time to prepare the space, manpower and equipment they needed. With controllable caseloads, hospitals were able to properly manage workflows, monitor infected individuals and provide supportive care that kept many cases from becoming critical."

Americans with obesity, diabetes, heart disease and other diet-related diseases are about three times more likely to suffer worsened outcomes from Covid-19, including death. Had we flattened the still-rising curves of these conditions, it’s quite possible that our fight against the virus would today look very different. To combat this and future pandemics, we need to talk about not only the masks that go over our mouths but the food that goes into them. Next month, an expert committee will issue its advisory report on the federal government’s official dietary guidelines for the next five years. First published in 1980, the guidelines are meant to encourage healthy eating, but they have self-evidently failed to stem the ever-rising rates of obesity, diabetes and other chronic diseases in the U.S. Pills and surgery can treat the symptoms of such conditions, but diet-related problems require diet-related solutions. The good news is that changes in diet can start to reverse these conditions in a matter of weeks. In one controlled trial at the University of Indiana involving 262 adults with Type 2 diabetes, 56% were able to reverse their diagnosis by following a very low-carbohydrate diet, with support from a mobile app, in just 10 weeks. The results of this continuing study have been sustained for two years, with more than half the study population remaining free of a diabetes diagnosis. Other studies have found that dietary changes can rapidly and substantially improve cardiovascular risk factors, including conditions like hypertension that are major risk factors for worsened Covid-19 outcomes. A 2011 study in the journal Obesity on 300 clinic patients eating a very low-carbohydrate diet saw blood pressure quickly drop and remain low for years. And a 2014 trial on 148 subjects, funded by the National Institutes of Health, found a low-carb diet to be “more effective for weight loss and cardiovascular risk factor reduction” than a low-fat control diet at the end of the 1-year experiment. Since 2018, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and its European counterpart have considered a low-carb diet as one standard of care for people with Type 2 diabetes, in part because it lowers blood pressure and improves HDL, the “good” cholesterol. A 2019 ADA report stated that a low-carbohydrate diet “has demonstrated the most evidence for improving glycemia,” that is, for keeping blood sugars in check. This could be a crucial factor for avoiding Covid-19’s worst outcomes: In a paper just published in the journal Cell Metabolism, researchers found that among 7,337 Chinese patients diagnosed with Covid-19, well-controlled blood sugar was correlated with “markedly lower mortality” among those with Type 2 diabetes.

Most of those nine million samples have already been processed, according to a daily record of nucleic-acid tests by Wuhan health authorities. As of Sunday, they said, the mass testing identified 218 asymptomatic carriers of the coronavirus, who were put under quarantine and monitored for symptoms. Just one of those cases was later recategorized as a confirmed case. On Friday alone, the city said it tested 1.47 million people—more than three times the number on the busiest day of testing in the U.S., according to data from the Atlantic’s Covid Tracking Project. The aggressive mass-testing regimen was ordered after authorities said a handful of coronavirus cases had been discovered in a residential compound  this month. The plan to test all of the city’s 11 million people—the initial goal was to do so within just 10 days—was greeted with doubt from some skeptics, who questioned the ability and necessity of testing so many people in such a short period. While falling slightly short of its ambitious target of testing everyone in the city, Wuhan was nonetheless able to test so many people so quickly by adopting an approach known as “sample pooling,” used earlier in the U.S. and Germany to track Covid-19, albeit on a much smaller scale.

In the study, conducted by an international group of researchers and published online by the Lancet, researchers looked at data on 928 Covid-19 patients in the U.S., Canada and Spain who had cancer that was either active or in remission. Thirteen percent of those patients died within 30 days of their Covid-19 diagnosis, according to the study. In contrast, the case fatality of Covid-19 patients in the U.S. is 5.9%, according to global coronavirus data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Cancer doctors have expressed worry about their patients during the pandemic, noting that these patients are generally sicker than others. Their immune systems might be weaker due to treatments or the cancers themselves, clinicians say, which can put them at increased risk for complications and death from infections. “This study confirms the idea that patients with cancer are at a higher risk of sickness and death from Covid-19,” said Justin Bekelman, a radiation oncologist and director of Penn Medicine’s Center for Cancer Care Innovation in Philadelphia, who wasn’t involved in the study. The researchers looked at all-cause mortality—death by any cause—for these patients. Some deaths related to Covid-19 aren’t recorded as such, and the virus can exacerbate pre-existing conditions that could lead to death, said Toni Choueiri, one of the study’s lead authors and director of genitourinary cancer at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. The study also excluded patients with noninvasive cancers.  "

Chinese authorities have aggressively touted the deployment of digital surveillance in helping to contain the spread of Covid-19. In addition to tracking potential patients with temperature-detecting cameras and smartphone location data, officials have also used QR code-based health-rating apps to manage the movement of residents depending on their risk of exposure. Hangzhou, a tech hub located south of Shanghai, was among the first cities to roll out a health-rating app. Developed by authorities with help from  Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. , which is based in Hangzhou, the app tracks a person’s travel history and health conditions in order to single out those at a higher risk of carrying the coronavirus.

The director of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, at the center of allegations around a potential laboratory accident, Wang Yanyi, over the weekend told China Central Television that the coronavirus was significantly different from any live pathogen that has been studied at the institute and that there therefore was no chance it could have leaked from there. Separately, China’s top epidemiologist said Tuesday that testing of samples from a Wuhan food market, initially suspected as a path for the virus’s spread to humans, failed to show links between animals being sold there and the pathogen. Gao Fu, director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said in comments carried in Chinese state media, “It now turns out that the market is one of the victims.” The comments, aimed at countering what Beijing perceives as efforts from top U.S. officials to focus solely on China, are unlikely to pacify critics. The Chinese officials didn’t address fundamental issues, such as widespread evidence that China initially covered up the extent of the outbreak. In their calls for more global scientific collaboration to track the source of the virus, they also stopped short of endorsing widespread scientific belief that the coronavirus originated in China. The question of the origin of the coronavirus has emerged as a major source of friction between China and the U.S. since the killer pathogen was discovered in Wuhan late last year. More than 5.5 million people have been infected world-wide, deaths from the disease are approaching 350,000 and economies everywhere are suffering.  "

U.S. consumer spending, the U.S. economy’s main engine, fell by a record 13.6% in April, the steepest decline for records tracing back to 1959. Personal income, which includes wages, interest and dividends, increased 10.5% in April, the Commerce Department reported Friday. The jump reflected a sharp rise in government payments through federal rescue programs, primarily one-time household stimulus payments of $1,200. Unemployment insurance payments also rose sharply in April, helping make up for some of the 8% decline in wages and salaries tied to job losses. Weak April spending, which economists say could be the bottom, adds to the evidence that the U.S. economy is in for a long, slow recovery. But gradual May reopenings of state economies and government support of businesses and households have led to a recent easing of job losses and a slight uptick in spending. “Some of the data suggests a stabilization,” said Kathy Bostjancic, chief U.S. financial economist at Oxford Economics. “It’s still overall a very tentative, slow recovery.”  "

But the lockdowns have done little to thwart the virus’s transmission within packed households. Outside of institutional settings like assisted-living facilities, large, multigenerational homes have emerged as one of the most dangerous places to be during the outbreak—a weak spot in the country’s public health response especially in the event of another wave of infections in the fall, as some experts fear. A Wall Street Journal analysis found that, across the country, the virus has spread more widely in places with the most crowded households, not necessarily places with the largest or densest populations. Remote, rural hamlets where extended families live under the same roof have turned deadlier than some of the densest blocks of Manhattan or Chicago, the analysis found. In both contexts, the virus has zeroed in on crowded homes, sometimes wiping out generations in a matter of days."

Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday. “Twelve states that reopened are now seeing spikes. This is a very real possibility.” This is Mr. Cuomo’s excuse for keeping New York City in lockdown purgatory for 12 weeks as other states reopen and their economies rebound. Democrats cite a spike in cases in Florida, Arizona and Texas as evidence of a virus resurgence. But more testing, especially in vulnerable communities, is naturally turning up more cases. Cases in Texas have increased by about a third in the last two weeks, but so have tests. About a quarter of the new cases are in counties with large prisons and meatpacking plants that were never forced to shut down. Tests have increased by about 37% in Florida in two weeks, but confirmed cases have risen 28%. Cases were rising at a faster clip during the last two weeks of April (47%) when much of the state remained locked down. Now restaurants, malls, barbershops and gyms are open if they follow social-distancing guidelines.

But a quarter of all cases in the state are on Indian reservations, which have especially high-risk populations.

About 80% of Americans who have died of Covid-19 are older than 65, and the median age is 80.

For most people under the age of 65, the study found, the risk of dying from Covid-19 isn’t much higher than from getting in a car accident driving to work. In California and Florida, the fatality risk for the under-65 crowd is about equal to driving 16 to 17 miles per day. While higher in hot spots like New York (668 miles) and New Jersey (572 miles), the death risk is still lower than the public perceives. The risk climbs especially for those over age 80. According to the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity, Americans over 85 are about 2.75 times more likely to die from Covid-19 than those 75 to 84, seven times more likely than those 65 to 74 and 16.8 times more than those 55 to 64. Fatality rate comparisons between Covid-19 and the flu are inapt because they affect populations differently. Children under age 14 are between 6.8 and 17 times less likely to die of Covid-19 than the seasonal flu or pneumonia, assuming 150,000 coronavirus deaths this year. Those 25 to 85 are two to four times more likely to die of Covid while those over 85 are about 1.7 times more likely.  "

With the potential for resurgences of the coronavirus, and some scientists warning about outbreaks of other infectious diseases, hospitals don’t want to be caught flat-footed again. So, more of them are turning to new protocols and new technology to overhaul standard operating procedure, from the time patients show up at an emergency room through admission, treatment and discharge. They are finding ways to triage and check in patients remotely, quarantine the infected in separate facilities and reduce physical contact with caregivers to prevent the spread of disease. And they are improving follow-up with formerly infected patients—and others—to look for red flags of disease. The aim is to be able to isolate and treat infectious patients while continuing to provide other vital services that keep people healthy and bring in the revenue hospitals desperately need to keep their doors open. These changes promise to markedly reduce risk and disease spread—and change the way people experience care even in times when there is no crisis. More aspects of the health-care experience may become more automated and efficient—from check-in through follow-up—but it will also become less hands-on than people have come to expect."

The poll also reveals striking partisan divides in how voters view a pair of unfolding national crises, including the unrest sparked by the killing of Mr. Floyd, the black Minneapolis man who was in police custody, and the coronavirus pandemic, responsible for more than 109,000 fatalities in the U.S. Nearly three-quarters of Democrats, 74%, said it may take the next year or even longer to curb Covid-19 and return to work as normal. By contrast, among President Trump’s strongest supporters within the Republican Party, 32% said the coronavirus is already contained. About half of all Republicans, 48%, said they were more concerned about the protests than the circumstances of Mr. Floyd’s killing, while 81% of Democrats held the opposite opinion. Those crises appear to have had little impact on Mr. Trump’s standing. His job approval rating stood at 45%, down 1 percentage point from April, according to the poll.

While Monday’s announcement by the National Bureau of Economic Research didn’t come as a surprise to economists, the group typically waits until a recession is well under way before declaring it has started. But this time, the severity and breadth of the coronavirus-induced downturn prompted it to break with past practice, “even if it turns out to be briefer than earlier contractions,” the NBER’s Business Cycle Dating Committee said. Investors are betting on that outcome: The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 461 points on Monday, up 1.7% and just 6.7% shy of its February highs. The probable duration of the recession is a matter of debate among economists and policy makers and is likely to influence discussions on the need for additional economic relief. Congress has already provided $3.3 trillion in emergency spending and tax breaks to support the economy, prompting some worries about a ballooning budget deficit. Some policy makers, including Larry Kudlow, director of President Trump’s National Economic Council, have predicted that consumer and business spending will bounce back quickly once social-distancing measures are lifted.

And to ensure the best results, they argue, this new approach should be overseen by clinicians specially trained in treating obesity. To be sure, doctors have long known that combating obesity could involve a combination of approaches. But recent research has deepened the understanding of each strategy and how they work together, so doctors can offer more-effective guidance to patients. The current crisis is heightening the need for better treatment of obesity, but the problem has been growing more serious for years. New federal data show that the obesity rate in the U.S. has hit 42.4%, up from 30.5% in 1999-2000. And many of those affected are in minority groups and underserved populations with little access to care. A growing number of medical groups classify obesity—defined as a body-mass index of 30 or greater—as a chronic disease and are pushing for wider coverage of treatment costs.  "

The proposed suspension could extend into the government’s new fiscal year, beginning Oct. 1, when many new visas are typically issued, these officials said. That could bar any new H-1B holder outside the country from coming to work until the suspension is lifted, though visa holders already in the country are unlikely to be affected. The suspension proposal is one of a series of legal immigration limits that President Trump is considering as part of an executive action he is set to unveil in the coming weeks. The administration has argued that the pandemic requires limits on immigration to prevent sick people from entering the country and to ensure that Americans get jobs first as the economy rebounds. Administration officials said the president hasn’t yet signed off on the plan, adding that it could change as senior aides continue to discuss the matter. “The administration is currently evaluating a wide range of options, formulated by career experts, to protect American workers and job seekers, especially disadvantaged and underserved citizens—but no decisions of any kind have been made,” White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said in a statement.

Now, France’s top law enforcement official has released guidance suggesting that it could adopt an approach to corporate corruption and bribery championed by the country it once criticized. The French Ministry of Justice this month sent a memo to prosecutors outlining how it plans to investigate and prosecute illegal bribes paid by French companies to secure business in foreign countries. The techniques and tools outlined closely resemble the ones used for nearly two decades in the U.S., where prosecutors have tried to encourage companies to detect and voluntarily disclose allegations of bribery, and reward the ones that do with more lenient settlements and discounts on fines. The memo even hints that French prosecutors may do exactly what many in the country found so controversial about the U.S. approach: They could prosecute foreign companies for misconduct in countries outside of France, even if the companies have only tenuous links to France. The U.S.’s practice of prosecuting French companies has long riled members of France’s political and business establishments. In the mid-2000s, the U.S. Department of Justice began actively enforcing the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, an antibribery law that prohibits the payment of bribes by companies with ties to the U.S. Our Morning Risk Report features insights and news on governance, risk and compliance. The enforcement effort wasn’t just focused on American companies. U.S. prosecutors secured hundreds of millions of dollars in fines against a number of French companies, including transportation company            Alstom SA      and oil and gas company            Total SA      . Last year, a member of France’s parliament wrote a report that addressed the issue, arguing that France needed to develop legal tools to protect its companies from laws in other countries that target extraterritorial conduct. Meanwhile, France has taken strides toward strengthening its own anti-corruption regime. The country created a dedicated unit of prosecutors to handle cases of major economic crime. It also passed a new anti-corruption law, known as Sapin II, which requires French companies or subsidiaries of a certain size to maintain compliance programs and internal controls to prevent crimes. But the memo issued June 2, which was signed by French Minister of Justice            Nicole Belloubet,      may be the strongest signal yet that France is looking to start policing its own companies with tools popularized by the U.S. “It’s a very important policy and political signal,” said Nicola Bonucci, a managing director at law firm Paul Hastings LLP in Paris. “The guidance is a way to say to the rest of the world, including to the U.S., ‘From now on the French are going to take care of [misconduct by] French companies.’” Language in the Sapin II law has long indicated that prosecutors could target foreign companies that carry out part of their business locally, as U.S. prosecutors do. How much extraterritorial reach the law gave France has been unclear, according to Mr. Bonucci, who was previously director of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s Working Group on Bribery. But the recent memo by Ms. Belloubet seems to suggest that prosecutors could apply the law broadly, stating that even a company or subsidiary that wasn’t legally incorporated in France could be prosecuted as long as it had some type of office or commercial footprint. The anticorruption law introduced a type of settlement agreement—called “la convention judiciaire d’intérêt public,” or CJIP, in France—that allows companies to pay fines and resolve alleged misconduct without admitting liability, similar to what is known as a deferred prosecution agreement in the U.S. Ms. Belloubet’s memo lays out factors prosecutors should consider when deciding whether to offer a company a CJIP, including whether or not the company had self-disclosed the infraction, and how cooperative it had been. A footnote in the memo even references and adopts the premise of a policy announced in the U.S. by former Deputy Attorney General            Sally Yates,      which called on prosecutors to ensure that the employees of corporations responsible for wrongdoing are also held accountable. Greater alignment between France, the U.S. and other countries such as the U.K., which adopted its own version of deferred prosecution agreements in 2014, could create greater collaboration among prosecutors. That trend has already been playing out in France. Earlier this year, France, the U.S and the U.K. announced a coordinated settlement with            Airbus SE      in which the European plane maker agreed to pay a combined €3.6 billion ($4 billion) to settle allegations of bribery.

The 48-year-old said his company had paid for car service for staff since March but he felt it was time to scope out public transportation. “If you don’t see what it’s like, you will stay afraid,” Mr. Warua said, adding that he planned to report back to his colleagues about the ride. “It’s almost like a mission today.”  "

While food companies and supermarkets say they have reopened plants and resolved supply constraints that contributed to higher prices, they also expect prices to remain elevated because of increased costs for labor and transportation. Companies are buying equipment and reconfiguring factories and stores to keep people safe from the new coronavirus. Some of those changes are adding costs that are trickling down to shoppers. “These are historical price changes we have never seen in a short window,” said Jagtar Nijjar, director of import and commodities at Gordon Food Service Inc., one of the biggest food-service distributors in the U.S. Prices for store-bought food rose a seasonally adjusted 2.6% in April from a month earlier, according to the Labor Department, the biggest monthly increase since 1974. The department is due to release figures for May on Wednesday, and many economic analysts expect it to be a sharper increase than April. Market-research firm Nielsen said food prices rose 5.8% in the 13 weeks from March 1 to May 30 compared with the year-ago period. Mondelez International Inc.  said it is considering smaller packages of some products like its Oreos and other snacks that cost less overall.  Campbell Soup Co.  said it might add more family-size packs that will cost less per ounce.  "

That is when the territory’s economy was ravaged by severe acute respiratory syndrome—another epidemic caused by a coronavirus—and then staged a remarkable comeback in less than a year. The outbreak started early in the year; by May, Hong Kong’s economy was reopening—like today. So speedy was the recovery that eight months after patients first hit hospitals, Hong Kong was hosting a $100 million concert series featuring the Rolling Stones, Prince and Neil Young. But a closer look at SARS shows why this time a sharp recovery is unlikely—in Hong Kong or anywhere else. Despite some similarities to Covid-19, SARS proved much easier to contain, and spread less broadly. The latest disease is more persistent and hard to detect, meaning reopenings will be slower and more tentative. And because the entire globe is infected, economies are less likely to fully revive until their trading, travel and business partners have recovered, as well. At the depth of the SARS downturn during the second quarter of 2003, Hong Kong’s economic growth fell 2.4% from the previous quarter, before rebounding 6.1% in the third quarter. Although SARS pummeled some industries, including aviation, the impact was largely limited to Asia, and the epidemic barely registered in the global economy.  "

The Machesney Park, Ill., company accelerated the development and launch of a telemedicine application and also built a feature to allow Covid-19 patients to check in to their urgent-care appointments. Both tools debuted in March. “We had to respond very quickly for our clients,” said David Stern, Experity’s chief executive. Established to offer quick diagnoses and treatments to walk-in patients, urgent-care clinics have emerged as the first go-to health resource for a growing number of Americans. There are about 10,000 urgent-care clinics nationwide, according to the Urgent Care Association, an industry group that represents about half of the clinics across the country. Over the past several years, many clinics have added more consumer-focused technology services, such as the ability for patients to check in and manage their care via mobile app, according to the association. Earlier this year, infection concerns forced clinics to shift their focus from in-person care toward telemedicine. Experity, which provides software for managing patient records, electronic prescriptions, insurance payments and billing to about 5,700 clinics, worked with an undisclosed vendor to develop a telemedicine application in two weeks. The Morning Download delivers daily insights and news on business technology from the CIO Journal team. The idea for a telemedicine app had already been in the works prior to the pandemic but the company initially aimed to launch it at the end of the year, Dr. Stern said. Instead, the company offered it to customers in March. Other companies such as            Teladoc Health Inc.      and Doctor on Demand Inc. have raced to add doctors and bandwidth for telemedicine services during the outbreak amid increased demand for the technology, which struggled to take hold before the pandemic. In late May, about 85% of roughly 1,100 urgent-care clinics were providing telemedicine services, up from 29% in 2019, according to surveys and reports by the Urgent Care Association. Urgent-care clinics have used Experity and other software vendors to provide those telemedicine services. To date, about 120,000 patients have been seen via Experity’s telemedicine app, Dr. Stern said. The company also launched a Covid-19 app for patients in March, which was built in three days. The app allows patients to answer questions about their symptoms and register for an appointment remotely without having to sit in the waiting room and potentially expose others to the virus. “We reverted to startup mode and that allowed us to really rapidly develop it,” Dr. Stern said. Experity’s 40-person product team worked with its dozens of software engineers to build both products while working remotely. Working remotely has been relatively easy for the team, he said. Productivity, measured by the amount of projects that each team builds and executes, has increased by about 8% over the past three months, he said. Dr. Stern said Experity’s competitive advantage is that its software is purpose-built for urgent-care clinics. Patient data can be easily viewed in the software through charts and other visuals that physicians can use to quickly look up patient histories and treat them, he said. Templates also allow physicians to quickly process and document a patient visit, he said. Experity was formed from the 2019 merger of DocuTAP and Practice Velocity. The company has 600 employees. Because urgent-care clinics provide on-demand care, they have unique needs when it comes to software, said Laurel Stoimenoff, chief executive of the Urgent Care Association. For example, they need to be able to quickly triage patients based on the severity of their medical conditions. They also need to make quick diagnoses, and software that’s easy to use and intuitive allows them to expedite that process. “Software that helps prompt a clinical decision is helpful because…the physician doesn’t know your long [medical] history,” Ms. Stoimenoff said. Software and technology for urgent-care clinics have drastically improved over the past decade, she said. When she first joined the association in 2004, the majority of patient records were still paper-based and health-care workers would sometimes have to pull them from storage units. X-ray records were stored on film instead of in digital formats, which were fire hazards, she said. Now, 86% of about 1,000 urgent-care clinics have a mobile app that patients can use to manage their care, according to an Urgent Care Association survey. That’s up from about 54% that indicated they had an online check-in system, either via website or mobile app, about five years ago, Ms. Stoimenoff said.

Someone needs to rein in the ICC and it might as well be Washington. The order allows the Justice, State and Treasury departments to impose financial sanctions or travel bans on any ICC officials who attempt to prosecute Americans. It expands on a previous round of travel restrictions on some ICC officials introduced last year. The immediate goal is to block an investigation the ICC started in 2017 into supposed war crimes in Afghanistan. That investigation is both vexatious and silly. U.S. officials accused of crimes already are subject to American law, while the ICC somehow thinks the Taliban will care if officials in the Hague prosecute the terrorists for genocide. The bigger aim of Thursday’s sanctions is to defend American sovereignty, and that of allies such as Israel that are also targeted by the court. The U.S. is not a party to the ICC, and both Republican and Democratic administrations have long worried the court would expose American officials to politicized lawfare investigations. Sure enough, Attorney General William Barr said Thursday the Administration believes Russia may be exerting undue influence on the court to tie down American officials in a long, costly and pointless Afghanistan prosecution. Mr. Barr also said he’s seen evidence of financial improprieties by court officials. If that’s true, the lack of effective accountability counts as another strike against the court’s legitimacy. The Trump Administration would perform a public service by releasing whatever evidence it has of alleged wrongdoing at the court. Meanwhile, Mr. Trump’s order is a vital defense of the constitutional rights of American citizens to have criminal complaints against them adjudicated in impartial, democratically legitimate courts.

But for many big players, including department-store chains and fast-fashion retailers, the pandemic only punctuated a yearslong reckoning brought about by a boom in online shopping. Inditex, a family-controlled chain that many analysts and investors see as having entered the crisis on a stronger footing, is one of the first big retailers to outline how it sees the industry’s future amid a tentative reopening. The answer: fewer stores and a more concerted push online. The closures will take place this year and next and affect as many as 100 of Inditex’s Zara, Massimo Dutti, Pull&Bear and other stores in the Americas. The affected outlets currently account for between 5% and 6% in sales. Asian and European outlets will take the biggest hit. Inditex said it would target small stores and ones where sales can be shifted to nearby stores, or to online. It expects to eventually recoup lost profit from the closed stores.  "

Thousands of volunteers have banded together on several continents to help in the face of the pandemic crisis. Since March, some 8,000 members of a British design group called 3D Crowd UK have printed parts for more than 170,000 face shields using 3-D printers in their homes. The group also arranges for the face shields’ assembly and distribution to hospitals and other health organizations in Britain. “We touched a chord with a whole community who had 3-D printers at home being used to print novelty items like Dungeons & Dragons pieces,” says Andrew Boucher, a 3-D-printing hobbyist and movie producer who is also the design group’s administrative chief executive. “They jumped at the chance to help save lives.” The group is just one of a growing number of supply chains to spring up in Britain, the U.S. and Canada, staffed by 3-D-printing hobbyists and entrepreneurs helping to make PPE for health-care and other front-line workers. The groups illustrate the potential for harnessing the power of distributed manufacturing to deliver products on a large scale. Such community-driven approaches are “incredibly agile and well-suited to respond quickly to local needs. In many countries, they have been supplying PPE to care homes, hospices and other institutions that aren’t on the radar of larger suppliers,” says Dr. Jenny Molloy, Dr. Molloy is a research fellow in the department of chemical engineering and biotechnology at the University of Cambridge and co-author of a paper in the peer-reviewed journal PLOS Biology about leveraging open-source hardware in the fight against Covid-19.

It’s not common to contract Covid-19 from a contaminated surface, scientists say. And fleeting encounters with people outdoors are unlikely to spread the coronavirus. Instead, the major culprit is close-up, person-to-person interactions for extended periods. Crowded events, poorly ventilated areas and places where people are talking loudly—or singing, in one famous case—maximize the risk. These emerging findings are helping businesses and governments devise reopening strategies to protect public health while getting economies going again. That includes tactics like installing plexiglass barriers, requiring people to wear masks in stores and other venues, using good ventilation systems and keeping windows open when possible. Two recent large studies showed that wide-scale lockdowns—stay-at-home orders, bans on large gatherings and business closures—prevented millions of infections and deaths around the world. Now, with more knowledge in hand, cities and states can deploy targeted interventions to keep the virus from taking off again, scientists and public-health experts said."

An additional 8,500 Minnesota protesters have been tested through their health-care providers or at other sites, with a positivity rate of 0.99% so far, according to the department. “We’re delighted that we are not seeing a huge increase in cases,” Kris Ehresmann, the infectious disease division director at the Minnesota Department of Health, said at a media briefing on Wednesday. New York City, where thousands have attended protests, made Covid-19 diagnostic testing available to anyone, and government officials have encouraged those who attended protests to get tested.

Such panic is overblown. Thanks to the leadership of President Trump and the courage and compassion of the American people, our public health system is far stronger than it was four months ago, and we are winning the fight against the invisible enemy. While talk of an increase in cases dominates cable news coverage, more than half of states are actually seeing cases decline or remain stable. Every state, territory and major metropolitan area, with the exception of three, have positive test rates under 10%. And in the six states that have reached more than 1,000 new cases a day, increased testing has allowed public health officials to identify most of the outbreaks in particular settings—prisons, nursing homes and meatpacking facilities—and contain them. Lost in the coverage is the fact that today less than 6% of Americans tested each week are found to have the virus. Cases have stabilized over the past two weeks, with the daily average case rate across the U.S. dropping to 20,000—down from 30,000 in April and 25,000 in May. And in the past five days, deaths are down to fewer than 750 a day, a dramatic decline from 2,500 a day a few weeks ago—and a far cry from the 5,000 a day that some were predicting. The truth is that we’ve made great progress over the past four months, and it’s a testament to the leadership of President Trump. When the president asked me to chair the White House Coronavirus Task Force at the end of February, he directed us to pursue not only a whole-of-government approach but a whole-of-America approach. The president brought together major commercial labs to expand our testing capacity, manufacturers to produce much-needed medical equipment, and major pharmaceutical companies to begin research on new medicines and vaccines. He rallied the American people to embrace social-distancing guidelines. And the progress we’ve made is remarkable. We’ve expanded testing across the board. At the end of February, between Centers for Disease Control and Prevention labs and state public health facilities, the U.S. had performed only about 8,000 coronavirus tests. As of this week, we are performing roughly 500,000 tests a day, and more than 23 million tests have been performed in total.  "

The market, a sprawling complex of warehouses and trading halls known as Xinfadi, supplies 80% of Beijing’s fruits and vegetables. Since Thursday, health authorities have traced 79 new coronavirus infections to the facility, which ships food to other markets and restaurants all over the city of more than 21 million people. Before the discovery of the first case in the market on Thursday, Beijing had gone eight weeks without registering a new locally transmitted Covid-19 case. The sudden return of the virus has rattled residents, who had been easing back into the rhythms of regular life after a period of strict pandemic controls. While movie theaters remained closed, many restaurants and shops had reopened, and traffic had returned to clog the city’s notoriously crowded streets.  "

Without testing, or weak testing, we would be showing almost no cases,” Mr. Trump tweeted Monday. While more testing does result in more cases, Dr. Fauci said, higher percentages of positive tests in many states “cannot be explained by increased testing.” With coronavirus infections increasing rapidly in a number of states, Dr. Fauci said a relaxed approach to public-health measures that reduce risk and spread poses significant hurdles to state and federal efforts. Throngs of people have gathered in many parts of the country, often without social distancing or mask wearing, prompting new warnings from state leaders of a return to shutdowns or possible punitive actions.

The University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation has issued a new forecast that Covid-19 fatalities would spike over the summer in states that have moved faster to reopen. Cue the media drumbeat for another lockdown. Maybe someone should first explain why the models were wrong about so much the last time. Take New York, where Gov. Andrew Cuomo locked down the state in mid-March based on dire warnings. His public health experts projected the state would need as many as 140,000 hospital beds and 40,000 intensive care units—two to three times more regular hospital beds and 10 times more ICU beds than were available. The UW model forecast that 49,000 regular beds and 8,000 ICU beds would be needed at the peak. New York was hit hard, but Covid-19 hospital bed utilization in New York peaked at 18,825 and 5,225 for ICUs in mid-April. Even in New York City, hospital utilization never exceeded 85% of capacity and 89% for ICUs. Government-run hospitals in low-income neighborhoods with the most cases were unprepared, but they were ill-managed before the pandemic. New York was the country’s frontline in the coronavirus attack, and caution was needed in the early days because so little was known about the virus. The original UW model, which was based on the experiences in Italy and Wuhan, assumed that strict lockdowns would curb infections, reduce hospitalizations and lower deaths faster than they actually did in the Northeast. Asked last month about when fatalities and hospitalizations would meet state thresholds for reopening, Mr. Cuomo responded: “All the early national experts, ‘Here’s my projection model.’ . . . They were all wrong. They were all wrong. . . . There are a lot of variables. I understand that. We didn’t know what the social distancing would actually amount to. I get it, but we were all wrong.”  "

Hinton, the FDA’s chief scientist said in a Monday letter. Nor is it reasonable, she added, to believe that “known and potential benefits of these products outweigh their known and potential risks.” The two drugs were widely touted by President Trump as useful to help patients afflicted by Covid-19, which some say contributed to panic-buying and shortages. Mr. Trump disclosed last month, that he himself had taken hydroxychloroquine, to ward off possible Covid-19 disease. In one tweet, he had claimed that hydroxychloroquine combined with the antibiotic azithromycin, “have a real chance to be one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine.” The FDA had issued the authorization for emergency use in treatment of Covid-19 in March, after the medicines had fallen in short supply.

The answer is yes,” said Bill Maris, the founder of Google Ventures, in 2015. Three years later, biomedical researcher Aubrey de Grey estimated that “people in middle age now have a fair chance” of never dying. Eternal life through advanced technology seems like a pipe dream for a society that, until recently, had trouble manufacturing enough masks to save doctors’ and nurses’ lives. Yet Covid-19 may turn out to be just the kind of crisis needed to turbocharge efforts to create what its advocates call a “transhuman” future. With our biological fragility more obvious than ever, many people will be ready to embrace the message of the Transhumanist Declaration, an eight-point program first issued in 1998: “We envision the possibility of broadening human potential by overcoming aging, cognitive shortcomings, involuntary suffering and our confinement to planet Earth.” Transhumanists, many of them associated with nonprofits and think tanks like Humanity Plus and the Extropy Institute, have long been driven by the fear that our entire species could be wiped out by nuclear war, asteroid collision, technological accident—or a pandemic. In March, as the coronavirus was spreading around the world, the science writer Tom Chivers observed that it proves the need for technological protection against such existential threats: “Humans could be around for a billion years, or more, if we don’t screw it up. Coronavirus won’t be the thing that kills us all, but it’s a bloody good illustration of how something could,” he wrote in the online magazine UnHerd. People have always feared death and dreamed of escaping it. But until now, that hope has been formulated in religious terms. Transhumanism promises that death can be conquered physically, not just spiritually; and the movement has the support of people with the financial resources to make it happen, if anyone can. Jeff Bezos, Peter Thiel and Elon Musk are among the Silicon Valley moguls who have invested in life-extension research. In 2013, Google entered the field by launching the biotech firm Calico, short for California Life Company. Transhumanists envision several possible avenues to immortality. Nanorobots could live inside our cells and constantly repair damage, halting aging in its tracks. Genetic engineering could eliminate the mechanisms that cause us to age in the first place. Such technologies are still out of reach, but transhumanists believe we will be able to master them sooner than most people think, with the help of superpowered artificial intelligence.  "

In Washington, Republicans and Democrats alike back new “Buy American” requirements for government health spending. From semiconductor makers to surgical-gown producers, companies are reassessing far-flung, multinational production networks that have proven vulnerable to disruption. “What the pandemic has done is highlight some of the ways that globalization may have gone a bit too far,” said Peter Anderson, vice president of supply chain and manufacturing for Indiana-based engine maker  Cummins Inc.,  which has 125 factories in 27 countries. A decade of disease, natural disasters and trade wars has shown how companies have been “putting a huge amount of risk in global supply chains,” he said. Those disruptions, he said, are prompting Cummins to accelerate plans to make its production systems less global and to concentrate manufacturing closer to where the final goods get sold.  "

Now Mr. Anton’s company, called X-Mode Social Inc., is one of a number of little-known location-tracking companies that are being deployed in the effort to reopen the country. State and local authorities wielding the power to decide when and how to reopen are leaning on these vendors for the data to underpin those critical judgment calls. In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office used data from Foursquare Labs Inc. to figure out if beaches were getting too crowded; when the state discovered they were, it tightened its rules. In Denver, the Tri-County Health Department is monitoring counties where the population on average tends to stray more than 330 feet from home, using data from Cuebiq Inc. Researchers at the University of Texas in San Antonio are using movement data from a variety of companies, including the geolocation firm SafeGraph, to guide city officials there on the best strategies for getting residents back to work. Many of the location-tracking firms, data brokers and other middlemen are part of the ad-tech industry, which has come under increasing fire in recent years for building what critics call a surveillance economy. Data for targeting ads at individuals, including location information, can also end up in the hands of law-enforcement agencies or political groups, often with limited disclosure to users. Privacy laws are cropping up in states including California, along with calls for federal privacy legislation like that in the European Union."

Some point to research that has found an array of benefits of positive peer relationships: Children who have them are more likely to later develop healthy romantic relationships and be more effective at work. Good relationships with peers during the teen years are linked to better health during adulthood. “There’s a key connection between having good peer interactions and social emotional well-being,” says Rebecca Rialon Berry, clinical associate professor of child and adolescent psychiatry at NYU Langone Health in New York. “In certain populations, we’re seeing that our depression and anxiety are heightening with continued quarantining” and other aspects of the pandemic. “We have to start talking about the calculated risk and taking some more.” There’s already evidence that social isolation may lead to mental health issues. About 23% of elementary school students in Hubei province in China had symptoms of depression and 19% had anxiety symptoms after two or more months of home confinement earlier this year during the region’s coronavirus outbreak, according to a survey of 1,784 children published in April in JAMA Pediatrics.

The  New York Times  and the Washington Post recently cited that study as evidence that the use of strict lockdowns to control the virus’s spread has been justified, and that current efforts to “open up” social and economic activity around the U.S. are dangerous and irresponsible. That is seriously misleading; the Chicago study is already out of date. More recent research supports the idea that the lockdowns should end. The Chicago study came out in early March and was the first truly rigorous economic analysis of the pandemic. It estimated that a three- to-four-month regime of mitigation, “combining home isolation of suspect cases, home quarantine of those living in the same household as suspect cases, and social distancing of the elderly and others at most risk of severe disease,” would save 1.76 million lives between March 1 and Oct. 1, resulting in benefits of $7.9 trillion, a number that far exceeds any conceivable cost of the mitigation strategy. They reached the $7.9 trillion figure by assuming that each life saved was worth $4.5 million on average. That number is an example of what economists call the value of a statistical life, or VSL. Used often by government agencies to evaluate proposals and projects, VSL is estimated by observing how much extra pay workers require to accept dangerous jobs. But as the Chicago team carefully noted in their paper, “the particular benefits estimates are only as reliable . . . as projections on Covid-19’s spread and health risks.” Unfortunately, their analysis relied on projections for Covid-19 from Imperial College of London that by now have been shown to be full of analytical and even coding errors, and its estimates of Covid-19’s impact were too high—by more than an order of magnitude. Inevitably, this meant that the Chicago estimates were also way off. Fortunately, economists no longer have to rely on inherently flawed projections. We can use real data. In what might turn out to be the best paper on the economics of Covid-19, a team of economists from the University of California, Berkeley carefully evaluated empirical data on social distancing, shelter-in-place orders, and lives saved. To measure the impact of social distancing, they gathered data from cellphones on travel patterns, foot traffic in nonessential businesses, and personal interactions.  "

The coronavirus is challenging the assumption that Americans must stay physically tethered to traditionally hot job markets—and the high costs and small spaces that often come with them—to access the best work opportunities. Three months into the pandemic, many workers find themselves in jobs that, at least for now, will let them work anywhere, creating a wave of movement across the country. Recessions tend to damp migration. Americans typically move with a new job already in hand, and hiring plummets during downturns. The 2008 financial crisis limited Americans’ mobility because millions of homeowners found themselves underwater on their homes, unable to sell without taking a loss.  "

White job applicants sought and received $138,000 and $144,000, respectively, while the figures for Asian candidates were $140,000 and $145,000. The wage gaps are emblematic of broader power imbalances within corporate offices and U.S. culture that have come under closer scrutiny since the killing of            George Floyd      in police custody in Minneapolis last month, said Peter Beasley, executive director for Blacks in Technology, a professional organization. “You know to ask for less, because that’s your only option,” Mr. Beasley said. “It’s learned. It’s been taught.” Mr. Beasley expressed cautious optimism that more aggressive recruitment and career development programs could help narrow such gaps over time. Average salaries offered to black tech workers surveyed by Hired increased by $10,000 since last year. Job seekers who identified as Hispanic saw similar gains, the survey found, with average salary offers growing to $141,000 this year from $128,000 in 2019. But the number of people who identify as black or Hispanic in many roles still lags behind Census Bureau estimates of the population, according to 2019 data analyzed by the Computing Technology Industry Association. African-Americans, which make up a 13.4% slice of U.S. residents, hold 7.8% of information technology roles, according to the trade group. Despite 18.3% of the population identifying as Hispanic, people from the demographic group hold 7.3% of information-technology jobs.  Ron Gonzales, president and chief executive of the Hispanic Foundation of Silicon Valley, said that current efforts to seek out diverse candidates, and to retain employees from underrepresented groups and elevate them into higher roles hasn’t matched many companies’ highflying public statements. “Based on the current pace of change, it literally would take decades to get this issue corrected,” said Mr. Gonzales, whose nonprofit provides education and scholarships for students seeking degrees in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Improving salary transparency would be a key first step for companies to address pay gaps, said Chloé Rice, co-founder of We Build Black, a nonprofit organization focusing on empowering black technologists. Deep-pocketed firms that often point to the difficulty of finding diverse talent also should invest in creating it, she said. “If these companies really want to fix their pipeline problem, they need to start by creating that pipeline and really putting their money where their mouth is,” Ms. Rice said.

Ophthalmologist Craig Sklar is selling his stocks anyway. When the pandemic hit, the value of Dr. Sklar’s investments tumbled. So did the income he earned from his private practice in Connecticut, which was forced to furlough staff and dip into emergency loans to try to keep its doors open. At 62 years old, Dr. Sklar, who had been hoping to retire in a few years, decided he couldn’t risk seeing his portfolio take a bigger hit. He sold much of his stockholdings at a loss between January and early March. “I don’t have 10 to 15 years left to recover my losses,” said Dr. Sklar, who still owns some stocks but now has more cash as a percentage of his portfolio than he has in decades. “At some point, I’ll need my cash to live on.” The coronavirus pandemic has created a crisis that some economists believe could take the country nearly a decade to recover from. Individuals like Dr. Sklar now face perhaps one of the most difficult investing decisions they will make in their lifetimes: whether to wait out a potentially long rebound or exit the market altogether.

In an interview on Wednesday in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump mounted a broad defense of his handling of the dual crises affecting the country in the year of his re-election bid: the coronavirus pandemic and the wave of protests following the killing of George Floyd, a black man, in Minneapolis police custody. Mr. Trump expressed interest in rooting out racism in America and said his plan to heal the country’s racial wounds exposed by the killing of Mr. Floyd and other high-profile cases of alleged police brutality was to build a strong economy. He expressed cautious optimism that any structural racism that exists in America’s economic and criminal-justice systems is getting better. “I’d like to think there is not” systemic racism, Mr. Trump said, “but unfortunately, there probably is some. I would also say it’s very substantially less than it used to be.” He said that the country was nearing the end of the coronavirus pandemic and that he believed China might have encouraged the international spread of coronavirus as a way to destabilize competing economies.

The first is that the Chinese economy would be changed irreversibly by the rising prosperity caused by market-oriented policies, greater foreign investment, ever-deeper interconnections with global markets and broader acceptance of international economic norms. Bringing China into the World Trade Organization in 2001 was the apotheosis of this assessment. The second proposition is that, as China’s national wealth increased, so too, inevitably, would its political openness. As China became more democratic, it would avoid competition for regional or global hegemony, and the risk of international conflict—hot or cold—would recede. Both propositions were fundamentally incorrect. After joining the WTO, China did exactly the opposite of what was predicted. China gamed the organization, pursuing a mercantilist policy in a supposedly free-trade body. China stole intellectual property, forced technology transfers from foreign businesses and continued managing its economy in authoritarian ways. Politically, China moved away from democracy, not toward it. In Xi Jinping, China now has its most powerful leader and its most centralized government since Mao Zedong. Ethnic and religious persecution on a massive scale continues. Meanwhile, China has created a formidable offensive cyberwarfare program, built a blue-water navy for the first time in 500 years, increased its arsenal of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, and more. I saw these developments as a threat to U.S. strategic interests and to our friends and allies. The Obama administration basically sat back and watched it happen.  "

Mr. Trump in April suspended immigration for 60 days to “protect already disadvantaged and unemployed Americans from the threat of competition for scarce jobs.” The order lapses this weekend, but Mr. Trump may extend the rules to permanently limit high-skilled and seasonal work visas. Restrictionists think this will spur conservative turnout and drive a wedge between Joe Biden and low-income voters. That’s also what they said before the rout of 2018. Reducing foreign workers will badly hurt seasonal employers and deny the U.S. the talent to create new businesses and compete with China. Start with H-2B visas for temporary workers, which are capped at 66,000 per year. Last year 44% of H-2B workers were employed in landscaping, 10.2% in recreation, hospitality and food services, 6.6% in housekeeping and 5.6% in meat and poultry with the remainder distributed across various industries. Before the pandemic, seasonal businesses from summer resorts to Gulf Coast shrimpers—three seafood companies were among the top H-2B visa employers—complained about a severe worker shortage. While many lower-skilled Americans have lost jobs during the pandemic, many businesses have still struggled to find U.S. workers to do grueling jobs like picking and processing crab.  "

It’s different this time. Younger people are getting sick with Covid-19. States that had brief coronavirus lockdowns are struggling to encourage social distancing and mask-wearing. Many people appear to have embraced their usual summer rituals. Health officials are sounding alarms about a surge in cases racing not through nursing homes, but bars and house parties. Hospitals are filling with medically-vulnerable elderly—but also 20-somethings and patients in their 30s and 40s. Some took the end of stay-home orders as permission to live their lives again, unimpeded. Phoenix entrepreneur Jimmy Flores, 30, spent the night of June 6 at a nightclub with friends, sharing drinks. Two days later, he felt sick. The next week, he was on a hospital oxygen tube after testing positive for Covid-19. “I’m a young, active, healthy person with no previous conditions,” he said. “I didn’t take it seriously for myself. I was not practicing the social-distancing guidelines. I didn’t wear a mask. I thought I was invincible.” Mr. Flores said he went from not knowing anyone with Covid-19 to knowing 15 victims. After eight days’ hospitalization, he is recovering at home. The U.S. has confirmed more than 2.4 million Covid-19 cases, and more than 124,000 have died, according to Johns Hopkins University data as of Friday morning. New cases have climbed to more than 30,000 a day—back to their April peak—after dropping to around 20,000 a day in May. Nearly 40,000 new cases were reported on Thursday, a record; Florida, Texas, California and Arizona accounted for nearly half of the new cases.  "

So it’s worth pointing out that states that didn’t lock down this spring kept the virus under control and experienced fewer deaths than most that did. A new analysis by The Sentinel, a Kansas nonprofit, compares the 42 states that shut down most of their economies with the eight that did not. The latter group includes mostly rural states with some small metropolitan areas: North and South Dakota, Nebraska, Iowa, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Wyoming and Utah. Private employment on average fell by 7.8% between May 2019 and May 2020 in these states while plunging 13.2% in the others. Rural state economies generally rely more on “essential” services like agriculture and food production, and some industries like energy and hospitality would have shed jobs regardless of the lockdowns. Still, private job losses were higher in states that locked down like Colorado (9.5%) compared to economically similar ones that didn’t like Utah (4.6%). Yet per-capita Covid fatalities in states that stayed open were on average about 75% lower than those that locked down. One reason is that deaths in most states, regardless of whether they locked down, have been concentrated in nursing home facilities and minority communities that have higher rates of underlying health conditions and multigenerational housing. This is a main reason hospitalizations and deaths continued to surge in states like New York, New Jersey, Illinois and Massachusetts long after lockdowns took effect. About half of deaths in New Jersey and Illinois have been in nursing homes, and most others have been in dense low-income minority neighborhoods where social distancing is difficult.  "

The White House and Mr. Philipson, 58 years old, said Wednesday that he would be departing the administration next week to return to his faculty position at the University of Chicago. He told the Journal Friday his illness caused him to accelerate his plan to leave the administration. Two people familiar with the matter said Mr. Philipson had been forced out. Mr. Philipson didn’t say when he was diagnosed or whether he had returned to work before his departure announcement earlier this week. The economist, whose academic specialty is health economics, stood behind Mr. Trump on June 5 at a Rose Garden event in which Mr. Trump touted an unexpected gain in U.S. jobs in May. A White House official said Mr. Trump spent little time with Mr. Philipson and wasn’t exposed. Mr. Philipson’s departure wasn’t related to his diagnosis, the official said.  "

Workers not on the coronavirus front lines haven’t faced the same health risks as those in crisis-critical jobs. But many people who are crafting marketing plans, processing invoices and otherwise toiling from home are confronting existential questions about the meaning of their work amid a world in turmoil. The professional network Blind conducted a survey for The Wall Street Journal in May, and found that 26.7% of nearly 2,000 respondents agreed with the statement, “I’m not considered essential or don’t think I am, but I’m still working. My work doesn’t feel particularly important or meaningful.” In April, roughly one-quarter of American workers felt that Covid-19 had threatened their job security and opportunities, according to a survey of 1,099 workers from the Society for Human Resource Management. As businesses begin to reopen and call back workers, some may now be feeling better. Employers added 2.5 million jobs in May, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, though 21 million people remain unemployed. The pandemic has led some workers to question positions that gave them a sense of purpose just months before. For Luke Sanders, who leads a production line at  Tesla Inc.’s  plant in Fremont, Calif., some discomfort set in while riding out a two-month furlough at his father’s house in Jupiter, Fla., after the factory temporarily closed in late March.

Costs for protective gear, cleaning supplies and labor for employees to take students’ temperatures and conduct hourly wipe-downs of doorknobs are already running into the millions of dollars. The added expenses come as many schools face severe budget crunches due to lower enrollment and tuition revenue, refunded housing fees from the spring and costs tied to shifting online. Even well-resourced schools are trying to fundraise to stock up on supplies. Reopening college campuses is contingent on approval from local health officials, who in some states haven’t yet signed off on campus-based instruction. Still, many schools remain hopeful and are pushing ahead with planning, with some already bringing student-athletes back for voluntary workouts. In Florida, one of the first states to reopen for business during the coronavirus pandemic, the University of Central Florida in Orlando will issue one reusable, washable face covering each to all students, faculty and staff—about 100,000 items. The school ordered another 250,000 disposable masks for visitors and those who forget their face coverings. The bill for masks was $309,000.  "

Fitness facilities in the Nordic country reopened June 15.

Stocks, commodities and bond prices careened in March as what experts had described as a mysterious illness circulating around central China morphed into a global pandemic. The longest-ever bull market for stocks came to an abrupt end, its demise caused not by a central bank misstep or a global trade war but by the economic fallout from Covid-19. At one point, it appeared the financial system itself was on the brink of collapse. Then something unbelievable happened on March 23: Stocks bottomed out. As the death count from Covid-19 soared and the U.S. unemployment rate jumped to the highest level since the Great Depression, investors waded back in. Markets slumped this week, pressured by fears that a surge in coronavirus cases around the country will force many states to reimpose curbs on business activity. It may still be too early to call a definitive market comeback. The S&P 500, which at its low point had been down as much as 31% for the year, is now just 6.9% from where it started 2020. “We’ve never seen anything like this before,” said Nancy Tengler, chief investment officer at Laffer Tengler Investments, who remembers working through the Black Monday crash of 1987, the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s and early 2000s and the financial crisis of 2007-08."

She made Paris her home nearly a decade ago but is now searching for a new home some 30 to 150 miles southwest of Paris. “Right now it’s a question of how and where do we survive this best.” In recent months, thousands of city dwellers have fled metropolises such as New York, Paris and London, moving in with family or into rentals to avoid crowds, be closer to nature or spend coronavirus lockdowns in more spacious quarters. While many have begun to return as restrictions have eased, others, like Ms. Gambey and her husband, Charles, are considering a permanent move."

Steve Olsen, that company’s co-owner and president, said he has had to lay off the majority of his 33 employees since the start of the coronavirus pandemic that has driven the county’s unemployment rate to 29.3% from 3.8% before the crisis hit in March. He figures it will be at least a year until the family-owned business is back to that level of staffing. “It’s been pretty devastating,” said Mr. Olsen, whose company supplies the automotive and aerospace industries, like many others in the area. The impact of both the pandemic and the economic downturn that followed lockdowns is widespread in Michigan, a Wall Street Journal analysis of unemployment and death data in more than 3,100 U.S. counties shows. Almost a quarter of Michigan’s counties are among the top 20% nationally for both increase in unemployment from a year earlier and deaths per 1,000 residents linked to Covid-19. Only Massachusetts and New Jersey saw a greater proportion of counties in both categories. Muskegon County: Ranked 27th for increase in unemployment and 560th for deaths per 1,000 residents.

Unemployment levels from the same month a year prior were used to counteract any seasonal differences. Rhode Island Covid-19 deaths are not reported at the county level. Larger-population Utah counties are reporting deaths at the county level, but some smaller ones are banded together into groups. In select other states, there also were a small number of deaths where county information wasn’t available. Deaths not assigned to a specific county accounted for 1.2% of the national total.   Deaths for New York City’s five boroughs are reported collectively, so they were treated as one geographic area with a combined unemployment rate. Sources:  WSJ analysis of data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and Johns Hopkins University Economic fallout from the pandemic makes for a volatile political situation in Michigan, a key battleground that President Trump won in 2016 by less than 11,000 votes, or 0.22 percentage point, the narrowest outcome in the nation. Muskegon was among the counties in the state decided by less than 2 percentage points, with Democrat            Hillary Clinton      narrowly winning it in 2016. The RealClearPolitics average of state polls has the presumptive Democratic nominee, former Vice President      Joe Biden,            leading Mr. Trump by 8 percentage points in Michigan. With less than five months before the election and economists predicting a prolonged downturn, voters by November may turn to whichever candidate they believe can best pull the economy out of decline while addressing concerns about the spread of the virus. Michigan had the nation’s third highest unemployment rate in May—21.2%—behind only Nevada and Hawaii, two states where the tourism industry has been crushed by the pandemic. Among the nation’s top 50 counties for unemployment in April—the most recent data available at the local level—32 are in Michigan. The state also has recorded the eighth-highest rate of deaths per 1,000 residents tied to Covid-19, with more than 6,000 fatalities so far. In response, Democratic            Gov. Gretchen Whitmer      imposed some of the most stringent social distancing requirements in the country. “It’s Depression-level unemployment,” said            Patrick Anderson,      chief executive of Anderson Economic Group, a consulting firm based in East Lansing, Mich. “The economy is going to get better, but we are talking about a very deep hole.” Factors contributing to the widespread devastation in Michigan include demographics, ties to international travel, social distancing restrictions and their duration, and the composition of the state’s economy, Mr. Anderson said. Other states with the largest proportions of counties ranked in the top 20% for both unemployment and Covid-19-related death rates include Indiana, Ohio, New Hampshire, Alabama, Mississippi, Pennsylvania and New York. There are 160 U.S. counties that met both thresholds, roughly 5% of the nation’s total. Muskegon County, with a population of more than 173,000 people, recorded 43 Covid-19-related deaths as of June 17. Stephen Gawron, mayor of the county seat of Muskegon, said his city typically welcomes 800,000 to 1 million people to its downtown from May through mid-September, but local businesses won’t benefit from those crowds this summer, because downtown festivals and lake cruises have been canceled. Mr. Gawron, who has spent most of his life in the city, said he remains optimistic because he has watched his community get through hard economic times in the past. “We will move beyond this because historically that is what we have done,” he said. The flurry of bad economic news in the county has been documented in mass layoff notices filed with the state.            Howmet Aerospace,      the county’s second-largest employer, cited the pandemic in its notice to the state about laying off more than 600 workers. It said some of the layoffs were voluntary and permitted through a collective bargaining agreement. Jim Edmonson, chief executive of an economic development organization in the Muskegon area, said it may take a year for the area’s manufacturing jobs to come back. He expects the unemployment rate could drop quickly after some state restrictions for sit-down restaurants, hotels and other businesses were lifted on June 8. “The 29% unemployment rate will come down quite a bit, but it is going to take longer in the manufacturing sector,” he said. “It might run 12% to 15%, depending on how quickly airline operations pick up and related aerospace manufacturing improves, and that might be the new normal.” How do you think the response to the coronavirus might affect the general election? Join the conversation below. Kellie and Patrick Lemke have both lost their jobs. Before mid-March, she was working in a medical office as part of a training program and he was a temporary worker at a manufacturing plant. “It’s been an emotional roller coaster,” said Ms. Lemke, a mother of five in her late 20s. “It’s going to take a while for us to get back on our feet. We don’t know what the future holds.” The family is getting by with unemployment assistance, food stamps and the extra $600-a-week benefit for unemployed workers, a benefit that is set to expire at the end of July. An extension of the benefit is being debated as Congress considers a new stimulus package. Republicans worry it gives some workers more money than they were making and will discourage their return to work, while Democrats say an extension is needed to keep millions of Americans afloat. To save money, Ms. Lemke said her family plans to move out of their $875-a-month rental property at the end of September and in with family members. Dan Kosheba, regional representative with the United Auto Workers union, said the area’s high unemployment isn’t being fully felt because of the $600-a-week benefit. “That pain will come more down the road,” he said. Rocky Smith Jr., a UAW worker in the county who was laid off in early April, said he normally makes $18.92 an hour cutting metal parts down to size after they come out of a furnace. “It’s very frustrating,” said Mr. Smith, 39, who is the sole earner for his family of four. “It’s not like we’re in a situation where I can go out and get another job, because there really aren’t any.” To save money, Mr. Smith said his family is skipping meals out, looking for other places to cut expenses and dipping into savings. “It’s not like anyone could be prepared for something like this,” he said.

Thirty-three states, from Oklahoma to South Carolina and Washington, had a seven-day average of new cases on Tuesday that was higher than their average during the past two weeks, according to a Journal analysis of Johns Hopkins University data. That was the situation in 21 states at the start of the month, so the data reflect recent increases in new cases. The seven-day average of new cases nationwide has been growing faster than the 14-day average since June 13, after lagging behind it since late April. Comparing the one- and two-week averages of new cases helps smooth out anomalies in the data, such as states not reporting cases during a weekend. New York and nearby states such as New Jersey were early pandemic hot spots, but cases and deaths in those states continue to fall. Now, public health officials are expressing concern about rising case counts, the positive percentage of tests, and hospitalizations in Southern and Western states. The recent case increases have already started to delay some plans to reopen economies. Oregon Gov. Kate Brown earlier this month paused the relaxation of coronavirus restrictions as cases in the state rose. In Louisiana, Gov. John Bel Edwards on Monday postponed moving the state into Phase 3 of its reopening for an additional 28 days amid a surge in cases and hospitalizations there.  "

The causes of the flare-ups are varied. Some may spread among young people ignoring social-distancing advice. Border counties in Texas have been especially hard hit, perhaps from cross-border migration from hard-hit Mexico. Houston had 60,000 people at the George Floyd funeral and demonstration three weeks ago, and masks weren’t ubiquitous. The outbreaks are worrying, but the reopening was always going to require trial and error. Opening up bars to regular business may have been a mistake, and now Florida and Texas are shutting them down or limiting the number of patrons. The flare-ups should cause people to be more cautious, but they don’t justify the economic and public-health damage of strict new state-wide lockdowns. As for chutzpah, the prize goes to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who reveled in the misery of others on Friday: “Oh, I say to them all, look at the numbers. You played politics with this virus and you lost. You told the people of your state and you told the people of this country, White House, ‘Don’t worry about it. Just open up, go about your business, this is all Democratic hyperbole.’ Oh, really? Now you see 27 states with the numbers going up. You see the death projections going up.” To reinforce his thumb in the eye, Mr. Cuomo declared that travelers to New York from Utah, Arizona, Texas, Arkansas, Alabama, North Carolina, South Carolina and Florida will need to quarantine for 14 days. The order applies to states either with a positive-test rate over 10% or more than 10 in 100,000 residents testing positive per day over the last seven days. This will be difficult to enforce, but Mr. Cuomo said New York police may pull over cars with out-of-state licenses.  "

On Wednesday the state Senate voted for a constitutional amendment, ACA 5, that would reintroduce racial preferences for who gets a state job or contract, or who is admitted to a state university. The state Assembly previously passed the measure, which means the amendment will be on the November ballot. It would repeal Proposition 209, which voters approved in 1996 and outlawed racial bias in state policy. The repeal effort received a boost from the killing of George Floyd, no matter the irony of voting for discrimination by race in the name of eliminating discrimination by race. Ward Connerly, a former University of California Regent who led the 1996 campaign for Prop 209, says this thinking has it backward. “I am delighted to hear a long list of Democrats say that the murder of George Floyd shd inspire us to treat everyone ‘equally,’” he tweeted. “They shd share this belief with members of the CA Legislature who are supporting ACA 5.” In other words, if the problem is police singling out African-American young men without cause, how is the answer to sort people by race in other areas of life, sowing resentment and pitting American against American? Today the effort to keep racial discrimination out of California is led by Asian-Americans. They realize that their children are likely to be the victims of disparate treatment if ACA 5 goes through, especially in college admissions. In 2014 the Legislature dropped an effort to repeal Prop 209 because of Asian-American opposition, but this time opponents were crushed.  "

New Delhi, a sprawling metropolis of some 30 million people, has rocketed to the top of the country’s regional coronavirus sick list as cases have rapidly multiplied in recent weeks. The central government took control of the local health-care response earlier this month—with the country’s powerful home minister overseeing it personally—in the midst of government warnings that some 80,000 hospital beds will be needed by the end of next month. That vastly exceeds the nearly 13,200 beds available across state-run and private hospitals in the city. Almost half of those are currently occupied, according to a government mobile app tracker. The capital expects coronavirus infections to soar to 550,000 by the end of July, up from the 70,390 cases reported through June 24. Well over 3,000 new cases have appeared every day so far this week, vaulting Delhi past India’s second-largest metropolis and other major hot spot, Mumbai, where a population of some 25 million has recorded 68,481 cases as of June 24. So far, 2,365 people have died of the disease in Delhi. “The capacity of the health-care system is being tested,” said Lalit Kant, an infectious-disease specialist and consultant who has worked in government public-health agencies for decades. “It is now on the verge of crumbling apart.”  "

Greg Abbott Thursday. The governor stopped short of a statewide shutdown, as Texas and other states previously ordered when the pandemic first hit. Hospitals nationwide emptied out in late March under the state orders, which governors began to roll back in late April as economies tentatively reopened. The order also allows surgeries that wouldn’t deplete hospital capacity. “As Texas faces a rise in Covid-19 cases, we are focused on both slowing the spread of this virus and maintaining sufficient hospital capacity for Covid-19 patients,” Mr. Abbott said in a written statement. The governor also announced a pause to the next steps to reopen Texas. But he said he wouldn’t clamp down where the state already relaxed restrictions. Texas has allowed most businesses to reopen with at least 50% capacity. “The last thing we want to do as a state is go backwards and close down businesses,” he said in announcing the decision.  "

In recent weeks, the number of new cases of Covid-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, has risen to around 1,500 per day nationwide from a low of fewer than 50 a day about two months ago. The surge followed outbreaks in schools that by Monday had infected at least 1,335 students and 691 staff since the schools reopened in early May, according to the education ministry. Epidemiological surveys by Israel’s health ministry showed that after Israel opened its entire school system without restrictions on May 17, a spike in infections occurred among the country’s youth that later spread to the general population. Government figures also showed that in the month of June schools were the second-highest known place of infection outside people’s own communities. Now, event halls and bars across the country have also been ordered closed again, and the government has warned additional restrictions could be necessary.  "

In Florida, hospital giant  HCA Healthcare Inc.  isn’t accepting patients transferred from other overflowing hospitals. In Houston, the daily hunt for empty beds has left critically ill patients to wait hours or days in emergency rooms for vacancies.

The sustained surge in hospitalizations there and in other cities like Phoenix and Miami is straining the response effort, as the need for beds is running up against shortages of staff—and in some cases space. Hospitalizations elsewhere in the U.S. have intensified demand for health-care workers, he said.

Unfortunately, many of the new cases they reported were already several days behind the speeding pathogen’s actual reach. The latest rash of outbreaks in Florida, Nevada, Georgia, Texas and beyond has resurrected one of the early problems that bogged down this country’s initial response to the pandemic in the spring: Many people in coronavirus hot spots are now waiting more than a week, and in some cases several weeks, for test results. Testing-supply shortages and delays can hamstring contact-tracing efforts, complicate decisions on whether to open or close businesses and cloud statistics used to track the virus’s spread. It also means some individuals are likely continuing to spread the virus because they either don’t yet have a result, were unable to get tested or haven’t yet been told that they have been exposed to an infected person. “You have no idea how many infections you have today,” said Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and head epidemiologist for the university’s Covid-19 Testing Insights Initiative, which tracks testing trends. “But it also just puts you behind the eight ball. It delays your ability to intervene, and that’s the whole point,” Dr. Nuzzo added. “What’s the point of doing a test if someone doesn’t get a test result for two weeks?”  "

The added capacity won’t exceed domestic N95 demand until this winter, the Federal Emergency Management Agency estimates, when the U.S. will be producing 180 million N95 masks a month, up from around 45 million in January.

In the past couple of months, Ms. Lucasti, who lives in Longport, N.J., has given more freedom to her teenage daughter and 12-year-old son. It’s partly because the kids are restless without their usual scheduled activities, and also because she needs space to handle her own tasks. “I have never left my kids alone in the house so much,” she says. Gone are the days of helicopter parenting: “I have let the helicopter down,” she jokes. Doctors see benefits in giving kids greater independence and freedom to make decisions. It would mark a departure from the hypervigilant approach adopted by many parents since the 1990s, which critics said harmed kids’ ability to develop problem-solving skills, navigate conflict on their own, and create an identity separate from their parents.  But with a less hands-on style come other concerns: Unrestricted screen time, which doctors worry can lead to inactivity, sleep disruption and anxiety. And the pandemic has brought myriad other stresses into family life—a lack of routine, schooling and socialization among them—whose long-term consequences remain to be seen."

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 30 children under age 15 have died from Covid-19. In a typical year 190 children die of the flu, 436 from suicide, 625 from homicide, and 4,114 from unintentional deaths such as drowning. Only two children under age 18 have died in Chicago—fewer than were killed in shootings in a recent weekend. In New York City, 0.03% of children under age 18 have been hospitalized for Covid and 7.5 in one million have died. The death rate for those over 75 is more than 2,200-times higher than for those under 18. Children so far have been shielded from the virus compared to working adults. But even pediatric cancer patients at New York’s Memorial Sloan Kettering were about a third less likely to test positive than their adult care-givers, and only one of 20 who tested positive required noncritical hospital care. In Sweden, which kept schools open, only 20 children under age 19—0.6% of confirmed cases—have been admitted to the ICU and only one has died.  "

Theresa Gilbert,      a 61-year-old in-home care giver waiting in line on a recent scorching-hot day, said money has been tight since March, when she caught a cold on the job and the agency she works for sent her home. She hasn’t worked since, and the food she gets here helps make ends meet. “Whatever I have, I make it do,” Ms. Gilbert said. Demand for the free vegetables, milk and canned goods on offer here has surged since the coronavirus pandemic torpedoed the U.S. economy, closing businesses and thrusting millions out of work. Social-services provider Camba Inc., which runs the pantry, said it served more than 18,000 people last month, nearly five times as many as in February, before the virus took hold in the U.S. The scene is being repeated across the country as the growing need hits food banks and pantries, leading to long lines of people seeking food and straining providers coping with shortages of high-demand products like canned goods even as they handle a crush of produce from sidelined food-service operations. Food-relief organizations are retooling their operations for the Covid-19 era, testing out new distribution tactics, bringing on temporary labor and scrambling to secure storage space to meet a level of need that some say could stretch into next year and beyond. Hunger-relief organization Feeding America, a nationwide network of 200 food banks and 60,000 food pantries and meal programs, estimates the pandemic could push an additional 17 million people into what it calls food insecurity this year. More than 82% of U.S. food banks are serving more people than they were last year, with an average increase of 50%, according to a June survey by the group. “The pandemic is putting pressure on a system that was already struggling to make sure all the food we are producing finds its way to people,” said            Emily Broad Leib,      director of the Harvard Law School Food Law and Policy Clinic. Food banks act as the logistics arm for a swath of hunger-relief programs, overseeing supply chains that connect donations to those in need. They recover surplus food from supermarkets, manufacturers, farmers and government agencies and then ship, store and distribute that food to smaller agencies such as food pantries and meal programs. When the pandemic first hit, consumer stockpiling decimated the supply of shelf-stable products that are the backbone of food-relief efforts. Donations of items like rice and soup dried up, forcing many food banks to buy the goods instead and compete with retailers and other food banks. The products remain in high demand as coronavirus caseloads soar in many U.S. states. “There is almost a bidding war for some of this product,” said            Kristopher Tazelaar,      a spokesman for Second Harvest Foodbank of Southern Wisconsin. One manufacturer told the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank it would only honor 50% of the organization’s outstanding purchase orders. “We had over 80 tractor-trailer loads delayed, shorted or canceled,” said Chief Executive            Lisa Scales. Earlier in the pandemic, Ms. Scales said, the group was hearing from vendors who told them things like: “If the shipping container gets loaded, and if the ship isn’t abandoned at sea, and if they let it dock, and if it clears customs without being seized by [federal authorities], and if we can find trucking, we’ll have your rice there in six weeks.” Those delayed loads are coming in now, she said, and the volumes are straining the group’s warehouse operations and capacity. The food bank leased space in a nearby convention center in May and June before that site was set to reopen for events. Like other food banks, it is leasing outside storage space at higher-than-normal levels and has brought on more workers to handle the goods, adding to growing costs. Top news and in-depth analysis on the world of logistics, from supply chain to transport and technology. Earlier this year, the Greater Chicago Food Depository was using the United Center, the home arena for the National Basketball Association’s Chicago Bulls and the National Hockey League’s Chicago Blackhawks, as a logistics hub. The organization sent almost 920,000 pounds of food to the arena between late March and late May, when faster distribution of the food boxes reduced its need for extra storage. Volumes at the Houston Food Bank, the largest in Feeding America’s network, have more than doubled since the pandemic. The group distributed on average 25 trailer loads of food a day in May and June compared with 10 during the same period last year. “We’ve been spending a fortune on trucking,” Chief Executive            Brian Greene      said. The group has rented a second warehouse and is securing a third, with more space to accommodate volunteers working under social-distancing requirements. That facility also will have refrigerated storage to accommodate a more than 10 percentage-point jump in donated produce since the pandemic shut down much of the U.S. restaurant and food-service industries. “The building doesn’t just grow,” said Mr. Tazelaar of Second Harvest Foodbank of Southern Wisconsin, which is trying to secure more cooler and freezer space. “Our partner agencies, a lot of them are doing it with the freezer you might have down in your basement.” Once goods reach pantries, social-distancing requirements are complicating distribution. Some groups are switching from their usual supermarket-type setups, where people pick out the goods they want, to drive-up operations, in which workers assemble boxes ahead of time and place them in people’s trunks. Organizations seeking to reach seniors and people in home quarantine are sometimes working with big digital operators focused on residential delivery.            Amazon.com Inc.      is donating delivery services to food banks across the U.S. through its network of Amazon Flex drivers. DoorDash Inc., known for its restaurant deliveries, adapted its software to accommodate bulk food orders and batched delivery routes through partnerships with government agencies, restaurants and nonprofits. New York City-based Camba, which relies on a mix of donations and purchased goods, said earlier shortfalls of basic items like milk are easing. Recently, the group received funding from a state program aimed at rerouting surplus agricultural products from New York dairy farmers and growers to food banks. Much of the milk, yogurt and produce the group gets now is given out the day it is delivered, said            Janet Miller,      Camba’s senior vice president. “Everything is kind of just-in-time.” Write to Jennifer Smith at jennifer.smith@wsj.com Copyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Studies have shown simulated sunlight can inactivate the virus on surfaces and in the air, and one study found the virus deteriorates much more quickly in warmer temperatures than in cool temperatures. Some of the other coronaviruses that have long circulated in the population tend to peak in colder months and wane in the summer months, and some thought that summer heat and humidity could work to slow the spread of Covid-19. Yet case counts of the novel coronavirus are surging in the U.S., recently hitting another single-day record of new infections. There are three likely reasons, public-health and infectious-disease experts said. They have to do with the current levels of immunity in the population, how the virus is transmitted and how people behave. Immunity to Covid-19 in the population is still low, the experts said, giving the virus lots of opportunities to spread. In one study published in the journal Science in May, researchers developed a model to see how seasonal changes in climate might affect the way Covid-19 spreads in cities in the U.S. and around the world.

The researchers say they have designed Covid-19 vaccines in ways that aim to make sure they fight off infections, rather than worsen them. The large, final-stage trials starting to get under way will look for signs of rare side effects like the ones that arose for vaccines for dengue and other respiratory conditions, including other coronaviruses. The rare complication, known as disease enhancement because it worsens the disease the vaccine is supposed to protect against, is a concern for vaccine research generally. “I think it’s important that we do rapid vaccine development, but I also think it’s important we do it safely,” said Dr. Barney Graham, deputy director of the vaccine research center at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease. He said he hasn’t seen any areas of concern in testing to date for the coronavirus vaccines.  "

Her son, a rising sophomore, had received no remote-learning materials from his school and didn’t hear from most of his teachers. Ms. Bunton’s method included collecting Amarrius’s cellphone and handing him the day’s work: a packet of practice college-prep questions she printed from the internet. “I’m educating him the best way I can,” said Ms. Bunton, a 41-year-old single mother. “I don’t want him to be behind.” With the next academic year quickly approaching, school districts and parents everywhere are racing to figure out how to resume learning during the coronavirus pandemic—with the interruption that upended the last school year beginning to look like a longer-term disruption. Los Angeles’s school system said Monday it will start the year online, while New York City recently announced a plan to bring students back to classrooms part time. Districts have to weigh the potential public-health risks of bringing students into classrooms against the shortcomings of remote-learning programs, which schools hastily rolled out in the spring with generally dismal results. The problems were amplified for children in the nation’s worst-performing schools, including at Jackson Public Schools, where 95% of the students are Black and just as many are considered low income. District parents say if education is the great equalizer, their children are at a growing disadvantage."

Latinos are 39% of California’s population, but 55% of all people infected with Covid-19, according to the department of public health. Every other racial and ethnic group in the hard-hit state, where more than 100,000 of a total 304,297 cases have been reported in just the past 14 days, accounts for a smaller or equal percentage of cases as their share of the population.

Along with East Los Angeles, communities like Lynwood, Boyle Heights and South Gate have some of the highest number of infections in the Los Angeles area. Local activists and medical experts said residents frequently don’t have health insurance, live in crowded apartments, and can’t afford to not work. Employment in service and manufacturing jobs where social interaction is unavoidable, including nearby warehouses and manufacturing plants, is common, as is the use of public transportation. “When all of this started…the buses were still full of brown and Black people going to work,” said Pedro Trujillo, an organizer with the aid group Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles, or CHIRLA. “People still need to work and they are exposing themselves to the virus.”  "

It came as officials at the White House and the Department of Homeland Security were considering scaling back the new rules, according to people familiar with the matter.

School officials nationwide are scrambling to figure out how to reopen schools as Covid-19 infection rates rise across the country. Two of the nation’s largest school districts—New York City and Fairfax, Va.—have said they will offer a mix of in-person and virtual learning in the fall, while the Los Angeles school district announced Monday it will have no in-person learning when school resumes next month. Many parents and teachers are concerned about the risks and restrictions associated with a return to in-school learning. Health experts advise parents to look for certain safety measures, based on the most current understanding of how the virus spreads—primarily person-to-person, with higher risks in crowds and indoors. Among the most important: Children should wear masks, be grouped into small “pods” that don’t mix with others, and maintain physical distance. Schools should also beef up hygiene practices and cleaning. Other recommendations include outdoor instruction when possible, lunch in the classroom, and improving air ventilation and filtration in schools. Choir singing and wind instruments are more risky, they say. Recess and outdoor gym less so. “It’s absolutely critical that we get kids back to school,” says            Joseph Allen,      director of the Healthy Buildings Program at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, who adds that there are costs to children’s physical and social well-being with ongoing remote learning from home. Dr. Allen and his colleagues recently issued a 60-page report on risk-reduction strategies for schools. Particularly important, he says, is minimizing the potential for airborne transmission of the virus by improved air filtration and ventilation in schools. This can be done by increasing the amount of outdoor air coming into classrooms through something as simple as opening the windows and using fans. Schools with mechanical ventilation systems should use higher efficiency filters and ensure the system is using the maximum amount of outdoor air rather than just recirculating indoor air. Portable air purifiers in classrooms also help. The American Academy of Pediatrics issued recommendations last month for school reopening. Their guidelines say physical distancing between students can be 3 feet—rather than the standard 6-feet recommendation—particularly when face coverings are worn. Nathaniel Beers,      a pediatrician at Children’s National Hospital in Washington, D.C., and a member of the committee that developed the guidelines, says the new distance recommendation was based largely on a June 1 Lancet study that suggests 3 feet between people is adequate. “If you’re saying 6 feet, there’s no way most school districts can meet that criteria and have more than 50% of their kids in a classroom,” says Dr. Beers. The group recommends middle- and high-school students wear face coverings as much as possible. Dr. Beers said with younger children who touch their faces, and likely masks, more frequently, the value of wearing one may be diminished. But other experts say universal mask-wearing is key to any school reopenings. Dr. Allen says building in mask breaks may be helpful. “Mask fatigue is real,” he says. Good times for mask breaks could be during “quiet time” or reading time, when people aren’t talking—which can emit virus aerosols into the air. Face shields are also a good alternative for children who won’t wear masks, experts say. Creating pods or distinct classes of children that stick together and don’t mix with the rest of the school population is another effective strategy, experts say, particularly in elementary schools. When a student tests positive for Covid-19, for example, only those in their classroom would need to get tested or quarantine. “It makes control a lot easier,” says            Ashleigh Tuite,      an assistant professor of epidemiology at Dalla Lana School of Public Health at the University of Toronto. “If you do have a case in a pod you can isolate students. You know who has been exposed.” Protecting teachers and staff is also critical. Staff should socially distance from one another, says            Alyssa Bilinski,      a doctoral student in health policy at Harvard’s graduate school of arts and sciences, who is working on a study modeling Covid-19 outbreaks in schools. Meetings should be held remotely and lunch eaten separately to lower risk of any virus spread. Experts say teachers should return to teaching in front of the classroom to create a buffer between them and students—as large as 15 to 20 feet. They should always wear masks or face shields when they need students to see their facial expressions. Most experts acknowledge the infrastructure isn’t there for regular, widespread testing of students. That likely won’t happen until there are affordable, rapid, saliva tests. But once available, regular testing of students and teachers is a good strategy, experts say. Countries in Asia and Europe have opened largely with avoiding large outbreaks, but experts note in most other countries community transmission rates of Covid-19 were low when schools reopened, in contrast to many U.S. states now. The consensus is younger children are less likely to get Covid-19, and while there is also some evidence that they may pose a lower risk of transmission to adults, it isn’t conclusive. Some experts say, however, that plans for school reopening should account for growing evidence that older students—largely teenagers—appear to have a greater risk of both developing Covid-19 and transmitting the virus. What precautions need to be in place in order for you to feel comfortable sending your children to school this fall? Join the conversation below. “By the time you reach high school the risk of infection is pretty indistinguishable from young adults,” says Ms. Bilinski. Some parents aren’t willing to wait to see what happens come fall.            Samantha Esposito      has already decided to home-school her children. “I am way more comfortable planning out a curriculum at home and giving them a consistent and safe year of learning, than the unknown of what school will be like next year,” says Ms. Esposito, a 34-year-old stay-at-home mother in            Rocky Hill,      Conn., with sons entering third-grade, kindergarten, and pre-K for 3-year-olds. She also has an infant girl born in March. “I know my kids well, and masks and barriers would be scary and stressful for them,” she says. “Additionally, if school got canceled midyear again, it would be disruptive and confusing.” She’s also worried about her sons bringing the virus home to her husband, who has Type-1 diabetes, and to her infant daughter. As a former third-grade teacher she says there’s no way to social distance children that age. “There’s no way to keep them apart,” she says. “If you are trying to keep them apart they are going to be miserable and so is the teacher.” Write to Sumathi Reddy at sumathi.reddy@wsj.com  Copyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

During the pandemic, their numbers have grown, and they are spending endless hours tracking down ancestors, scanning photos, building family trees online—and attempting to share it all with everyone else. Pamela Haltmeyer, 77, has been trying to interest her husband in her findings as they shelter at home in Garland, Texas. Mrs. Haltmeyer, a retired language therapist, has been working on her family tree, trying to identify other descendants of her great-great-grandfather, John W. Noble. She may have found one and plans to send the woman a DNA kit as a gift, along with some cookies, just to be sure. Her husband, Norman Haltmeyer, isn’t enthused. “It seems like Norman would be fascinated by the tidbits that I share with him,” she says. “It’s history. I don’t know why he isn’t fascinated.”"

The Trump administration has said that the array of travel and visa restrictions enacted since January were intended to slow the spread of the virus and block classes of foreign workers to open jobs for unemployed Americans. The restrictions affected China, Europe and Brazil, and people holding a range of visas, including the prized H-1B for high-skilled workers. According to the memo, students in European countries who already have visas to study in the U.S., but were blocked by the March travel ban, will be able to come to the U.S. for classes in the fall. Students who can get a visa can also come. “Granting [this exemption] will assist with the economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic and bolster key components of our trans-Atlantic relationship,” a State Department spokesman said in a statement in response to earlier questions about student visas. “We appreciate the transparency and concerted efforts of our European partners and allies to combat this pandemic and welcome the EU’s reciprocal action to allow key categories of essential travel to continue.” The blanket exemption for these students provides certainty for tens of thousands of students from the U.K. to Italy and Kosovo who returned to their home countries when universities shut in the spring. These students were uncertain whether they could return in time for the fall semester if travel bans weren’t lifted. The exemption doesn’t extend to students in China and Brazil, who face similar travel restrictions. It also doesn’t affect new students awaiting interviews at U.S. consulates for their visas. Many of these people can’t make appointments until the fall, after their semesters have already begun. The State Department separately said on Twitter that some routine visa processing that had been suspended due to the pandemic restarted this week, though not at every consulate. Students in banned countries using J-1 visas—typically people conducting research or working as medical residents—can be exempted on a case-by-case basis, the memo said. The State Department also disclosed in its memo to Congress a series of exemptions to President Trump’s June ban on several visa categories, which included au pairs. Rebecca Morgan, a spokeswoman for NAFSA: Association of International Educators, a nonprofit dedicated to international education, said that the State Department’s decision was heartening and that the organization looks forward to when all international students are welcomed to the U.S. “We urge the administration to follow a science-based decision making approach to ensure a safe and expedient restoration of travel for all including international students,” she said. The administration came under fire last month from families who say they rely on au pairs to take care of their children so they are able to work themselves. Approximately 20,000 young people, primarily women, work in the U.S. each year as au pairs, according to the State Department, which regulates the program. The memo provided several carve-outs for parents who are medical providers or researchers working on Covid-19 and families who have children with certain medical conditions. Some families on U.S. visas had also been separated as a result of the June visa ban, typically because a family member traveled abroad. The new State Department guidelines say that if the primary visa holder is already present in the U.S., such as an H-1B holder, his or her family members are welcome to return and join them. That exemption partially resolves a lawsuit filed by separated spouses on Tuesday. Get a coronavirus briefing six days a week, and a weekly Health newsletter once the crisis abates: Sign up here.

The result has been to discourage research on such topics and limit the writers’ careers, some people in the field say. That, in circular fashion, limits the diversity of thought at the major journals, whose editors serve as gatekeepers for the profession and whose publications influence national economic policy making. “These journals are supposed to be trendsetters, they’re supposed to serve as the beacon for where the discipline is going,” said Rodney Andrews, associate professor of economics at the University of Texas, Dallas. “So if you notice a lack of papers in those journals that address [race-related issues], then one could infer that maybe those issues are not as important,” he said. Some editors at the top economics journals defend their track records, but others agree they need to do more to diversify their ranks and think differently about race-related work. The discussions come as the recent killing of George Floyd while in police custody has cast a spotlight on issues of racial inequality. The American Economic Association, meanwhile, has said it wants to improve the profession’s climate, after a survey released last year and other developments revealed concerns about racial and gender discrimination in the field.

Well, flare-ups are now occurring in several countries that recently eased their lockdowns and travel restrictions. Victory declarations anywhere are premature. New cases doubled in Spain over the weekend and are up six-fold in a month. Government officials have tied cases to migrant farm workers, tourists, family gatherings and young people partying. Catalonia, a tourist region known for vineyards and beaches, this weekend ordered the closure of night clubs and late-night bars. “Certain generations haven’t remained vigilant,” Spain Ministry of Health emergency director Fernando Simón said. Governors Doug Ducey of Arizona and Greg Abbott of Texas can sympathize. The United Kingdom has imposed a quarantine on travelers returning from Spain, which could be a blow to its tourism industry and economy that are trying to revive. But as Spanish officials point out, flare-ups have occurred across Europe since countries reopened their borders and economies a month ago. Germany recently reported an outbreak in Bavaria tied to migrant farm workers from Romania. Last week France’s Directorate General of Health warned “the circulation of the virus is increasing” after the country recorded more than 200 outbreaks. France is recording twice as many new cases per day as two weeks ago and last week mandated masks in public spaces. Australia’s new daily cases have increased 11-fold in the last month. Cases have increased though Australia’s government locked down Melbourne. Civil disobedience is rife. Nearly 90% of the infected didn’t isolate between the time they started showing symptoms and were tested, Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews recently noted. More than half of those infected didn’t isolate after being tested and when they got their results.  "

The news followed announcements by the University of Missouri’s Trulaske College of Business and the University of St. Thomas’s Opus College of Business in Minnesota, both of which said they wouldn’t admit a new M.B.A. class this fall. The pandemic accelerated Purdue’s decision to shut down its traditional M.B.A. and focus on other graduate and undergraduate degrees, said Tim Newton, a spokesman for the Krannert school. “I don’t think we’ll be the last school to pause our M.B.A. program,” he said. “Within the next five or 10 years, there will only be a pretty select group of residential M.B.A. programs left. A lot of schools outside of the top 20 or 30 will struggle to keep afloat.”  "

The spread of a deadly virus across the globe shifted the focus of the tiny Champaign, Ill., startup to another ultraviolet light application that it had not planned to introduce for at least two years. This one would disinfect crowded spaces.Within weeks, the 10-person company began shipping prototypes. Eden Park has since delivered more than 1,000 of the lights and added a dozen workers, including a head of manufacturing. “We have pivoted and put all our attention on this,” said Eden Park Chief Executive John Yerger, who joined the company in February to help commercialize technology developed at the University of Illinois. “We are now profitable. We are about 10 times bigger in terms of sales.” The coronavirus pandemic is creating new opportunities for some small businesses even as it raises costs and devastates sales for others. It is prompting many to re-examine their strategies and make tough decisions about how to adapt. One seller of professional and college team sports apparel stuck to what it did best, gambling that gear with logos would still sell during a sports drought. A decades-old furniture maker ramped up efforts to sell online instead of largely relying on its showrooms. A restaurant supplier boosted production of tamper-evident labels for home deliveries. An insurance brokerage sold smaller policies that are less profitable, but easier to get done. “Firms that are changing now are making changes to survive,” said Jacqueline Kirtley, an assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School. What they do after the pandemic ends, she said, “will tell us whether they pivoted or just fought the fire and survived.”"

Walmart Inc.,  Safeway Inc.,  Tyson Foods Inc.  and some health-care facilities have been sued for gross negligence or wrongful death since the coronavirus pandemic began unfolding in March. Employees’ loved ones contend the companies failed to protect workers from the deadly virus and should compensate their family members as a result. Workers who survived the virus also are suing to have medical bills, future earnings and other damages paid out. In responding to the lawsuits, employers have said they took steps to combat the virus, including screening workers for signs of illness, requiring they wear masks, sanitizing workspaces and limiting the number of customers inside stores. Some point out that it is impossible to know where or how their workers contracted Covid-19, particularly as it spreads more widely across the country. The new coronavirus has created a global health and economic crisis, responsible for the death of more than 150,000 people in the U.S. while straining resources and institutions.

Chief Executive Albert Bourla criticized executive orders signed last week by President Trump aimed at reducing U.S. drug prices, saying such policies risk detracting from the effort to develop Covid-19 medications at a critical time. “They pose enormous distraction at a time when the industry needs to be completely focused on developing potential Covid vaccines or treatment,” Mr. Bourla said on a conference call after Pfizer reported second-quarter financial results.

That’s because physicians, scientists and public-health experts still don’t know how long immunity to the disease lasts. Studies have shown declining or undetectable antibodies in Covid-19 patients two or three months after they were sick. That has led some experts to question whether patients could be reinfected at that point. A key question is whether the antibodies drop to a level that doesn’t protect a person from infection, said Stuart Neil, head of the infectious-diseases department at King’s College London. He added that it is possible that a potential vaccine will require a booster later. With the understanding of immunity still developing, people who have recovered from the virus shouldn’t assume they can’t get sick again.

Only a handful of vaccines generate lifetime immunity for most people, such as the ones for measles, a viral infection that naturally produces lifelong immunity. Experts caution against expectations of such longevity for Covid-19, citing experience with other respiratory viruses plus emerging data on the longevity of the antibodies that can prevent the virus from entering human cells and replicating. To fill in knowledge gaps on vaccine duration, researchers and vaccine developers are looking closely at emerging science of immune responses in recovered patients, and how that science can be applied to vaccine development. They are also looking at previous coronaviruses and harnessing vaccine technologies that have worked against other viruses. “Unfortunately, the questions of duration and immunity do take time to uncover,” said Philip Dormitzer, viral vaccine R&D chief for  Pfizer Inc.,  which is developing a vaccine candidate with partner  BioNTech SE . Vaccine-makers usually learn how long a shot protects during a second-phase study in hundreds of patients that may require months or years to complete. However, to save time for Covid-19 vaccines, trial phases are being compressed or combined, so less is known about durability near the end of the testing process than normal.  "

It’s a question scientists are still working on, and the answer has significant implications for vaccine development and public-health guidelines. For now, physicians are cautioning patients to continue following social-distancing and mask recommendations even after they have recovered from Covid-19 or even if they have tested positive for antibodies. “I don’t think people should let their guard down,” said Daniel Griffin, chief of infectious diseases for ProHealth Care New York, a physician practice. “We still need to treat this virus with respect.” He and others noted that it is fairly common to lose immunity to some viruses after a certain amount of time, pointing to the coronaviruses that cause the common cold. One recently published study of 191 people in New York City found that being infected once by one of two cold-causing coronaviruses didn’t make a person less likely to be infected by the same virus a second time after 34 weeks. When a person is infected with the new coronavirus or another pathogen, the body mounts an immune response that includes producing antibodies, proteins that bind to the virus and trigger an immune cascade to neutralize it. Antibodies are produced by white blood cells called B cells and are part of the so-called adaptive arm of the immune response—the part of the immune system that learns to recognize and neutralize specific pathogens. It allows the body to mount a stronger, faster neutralizing response the next time the body is hit by the same pathogen.  "

They’ll make breakfast on the island in their big kitchen and sit on their heated balcony. They’ll walk out of their private entrance and use an elevator that serves only three other units. They’ll work out in a series of small exercise rooms and gather with friends at a restaurant in a glass atrium. Hopefully, Covid-19 will be a distant memory. But every aspect of these homes will have been shaped by the pandemic. Mr. Covin tore up his original plan for a part-hotel, part-condo project with small kitchens, few balconies and large amenity spaces, and began redrawing the concept in March. “For sure, there are going to be long-term changes in behavior because of this,” said Mr. Covin, who still aims to break ground this year. One of the trickiest parts of a luxury real-estate developer’s job is divining what buyers and renters will value—and pay top dollar for—in the three, four or even five years it takes to go from design to completion. Covid-19 has made that more complex, as developers try to tease out which parts of the pandemic experience will fade away and which will remain as part of the culture. Some costs can be passed on to the renters or buyers who want the changes enough to pay more for them. Mr. Covin, for example, was originally planning units in the $300,000 to $500,000 range, but now thinks buyers will pay $350,000 to $750,000 for larger units that can be used as second homes."

The several hundred producers, set designers, painters and carpenters working to get productions ready undergo tests for Covid-19 weekly, and sometimes more often. An app tracks workers’ symptoms between tests, and a badge system prevents anyone without a negative test result from opening doors on the lot. The regime of testing will cost more than $1.5 million a month once cameras are rolling and several thousand workers are on set, said the studio’s chief executive, Frank Patterson, noting that is what is needed to stay in business.

Evidence is building that the recovery will be halting and slow rather than the V-shaped rebound that some economists had earlier projected. A day after reporting the sharpest quarterly economic contraction on record, the government said Friday households boosted spending a healthy 5.6% in June. The increase—reflecting higher purchases of products and services such as medical care, restaurant meals, travel and clothing—followed an 8.5% increase in May after household spending crashed earlier in the spring. The ability and willingness of Americans to return to the marketplace will be the key ingredient of any recovery, and economists still expect a third-quarter economic bounce back. Whether it will be sustained is unclear. Credit-card spending data, for instance, shows households have moderated spending in recent weeks as the country faces a surge in infections. A University of Michigan report Friday showed consumer confidence fell in July. The expiration this week of a $600 weekly unemployment benefit amid congressional gridlock could further slow the recovery. Federal and state unemployment benefits have propped up household income during the pandemic, with payouts totaling $1.4 trillion in June, up from pre-pandemic levels of around $28 billion, a Commerce Department report said. “The more Covid cases there are, the more fear there is from consumers and that impacts their spending in a negative way,” said Lara Koslow, managing director and senior partner at Boston Consulting Group. The company conducted surveys in July showing new peaks in the number of consumers who say they are concerned about going outside their homes for fear of catching the virus. Such consumers are less likely to spend, Ms. Koslow said.  "

They are also by far our best hope to stop the Covid-19 pandemic. Our other choices for stopping the disease are staying apart, which hammers our economy and society, or building “herd immunity” through natural infection, which would mean more than a million deaths in the U.S. and 10 million or more deaths world-wide. But the push for a Covid-19 vaccine faces three key hurdles. First, will it work? Preliminary studies indicate that several types of vaccine now in development produce a strong immune response. This is good news, but it doesn’t mean that the vaccine will protect people against infection or disease. We don’t know whether the immune response is protective, and if it is, how extensive that protection will be. (Protection ranges from 0% to 60% for influenza vaccines to 95% or higher for some other vaccines.) Even if a vaccine protects against disease, it may not prevent people from becoming infected and spreading the virus to others. Nor do we know whether all people will be protected by a new vaccine—particularly older people, who are at a markedly higher risk from Covid-19 and may be less likely to have a strong immune response. We also don’t know how long any protection will last. We don’t even know how protective natural Covid-19 infection is; for many vaccines, the extent of immunity to natural infection is the ceiling of their potential efficacy. “        We don’t know whether all people will be protected by a new vaccine.        ” Still, we have ample reason to be guardedly optimistic that some vaccines will provide some level of protection, and that this will be demonstrated before the end of 2020. Some vaccine candidates may be duds, and others’ efficacy may wane within just a few months—something that will, of course, take many months to know. Different vaccines may be more or less effective, and some vaccines may work less well for some groups. And most vaccines never make it to approval; many of today’s promising candidates may fail. We simply don’t know. That’s what studies are for. Second, will it be safe? What could go wrong with new vaccines? A lot. Several candidate vaccines use a harmless virus as a “vector” to deliver the antigen. This technology is promising, but we have limited experience using it. And we’ve never used DNA or RNA vaccines—the technology used for several Covid-19 vaccines in development—in humans. We now know that a small proportion of children who contract Covid-19 get a potentially life-threatening inflammatory condition as their immune system reacts to the coronavirus. A vaccine could, in rare instances, create a similar immune storm that causes severe illness, particularly in children, either from the vaccine itself or from subsequent exposure to the virus. There is no particular reason to believe that Covid-19 vaccines will cause this type of overreaction, but it is a risk and must be studied, both before and after approval. Polio vaccination provides a cautionary tale. Soon after the vaccine was invented, one manufacturer contaminated a batch of vaccine, and many children became paralyzed. In 1976, when an outbreak of H1N1 influenza at Fort Dix, N.J., sparked concern about a pandemic, President            Gerald Ford      led the effort to vaccinate tens of millions of Americans. But the feared pandemic never materialized, and the vaccine paralyzed more than 500 people, some of whom had lifelong problems as a result. Despite these rare and unfortunate episodes, vaccines are still strikingly safe: Billions of doses are given to people world-wide each year, with very few problems. Yet adverse events from vaccination may not be apparent until hundreds of thousands or millions of people have been vaccinated, so there can be no shortcuts on safety. Humility is in order. Third, can we get it to people? Even if we can develop an effective vaccine with a reassuring initial safety record, will we be able to get it to people? Vaccine manufacturing isn’t simple. Failures or contamination can happen, even with experienced pharmaceutical companies—and not all the companies making the new vaccines are experienced. And even if an effective, apparently safe vaccine is produced in large quantities, it will be difficult to distribute it quickly and equitably, to store and ship it at the right temperature, to educate physicians and inform communities and to monitor uptake and possible harmful aftereffects. The protection provided by even a highly effective vaccine is only as good as our delivery systems. The measles vaccine is more than 90% effective, but the World Health Organization reports that more than 140,000 children died of the disease world-wide last year—most of them in communities with low vaccination rates. “        Particularly in this election season, the process of vaccine evaluation must be scientifically rigorous and open.        ” The biggest challenge to getting a Covid-19 vaccine into enough people’s arms won’t be scientific, technical or logistical; it will come from a lack of trust. Particularly in this election season, the process of vaccine evaluation must be scientifically rigorous and open. Public trust can be eroded by large profit margins for vaccine makers, a lack of transparency about the cost of production and prices that fail to take into account the fact that many vaccines benefit substantially from publicly funded research. Open meetings of the key advisory committees of the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will be indispensable. We must level with the American public in a way that hasn’t been done during this pandemic. We don’t have enough tests, so we need to prioritize. We don’t have enough protective equipment for health-care workers, so we should produce safely reusableN95 masks. And when vaccines do arrive, we won’t have enough for everyone. Different vaccines may become available at different times, and some will probably work better than others. Governments will need to set priorities among different groups, considering such factors as the risk of severe Covid-19 disease, protection of essential functions and fairness. Workers in jails, nursing homes and hospitals, for instance, and Black and Hispanic people are more likely to be exposed to the virus and to have underlying health conditions that make them particularly vulnerable. Moreover, vaccines won’t provide perfect protection and probably won’t completely end the pandemic. In our interconnected world, a truly global vaccination campaign will be essential to America’s long-term health and economic recovery.  Even within the U.S., unless the vaccine is extraordinarily effective and accepted, cases and clusters will continue, necessitating quick, effective public-health responses. Our society will still have to adapt to limit the virus’s spread—reducing close contact indoors, holding off on handshakes, wearing masks and improving ventilation. And unless the vaccine is surprisingly potent or we discover very effective treatments, my 91-year-old mother won’t be returning to her beloved choir practices soon. Deploying a Covid-19 vaccine is the most important thing we can do to restore some order and normalcy to our world. We can’t afford to get it wrong. —Dr. Frieden was the director of the CDC from 2009 to 2017.

Now they are facing another unparalleled challenge: a renewed Ebola outbreak inside a coronavirus pandemic. In recent weeks, Congolese authorities have reported a sharp rise in Ebola infections in the remote and forested northern Équateur province, with 67 cases and 31 deaths. Cases began to emerge in June, just as the world’s second-deadliest Ebola outbreak, which killed some 2,300 people, was nearing its end in the eastern part of the country. Ebola’s return has come in tandem with a surge in coronavirus cases across much of Congo. The vast central African country, with a population of 88 million and a land mass the size of Western Europe, has registered over 8,800 cases of Covid-19, with 208 deaths, but testing is sparse and the true number of infections is likely far higher. The coronavirus has spread to 15 of the country’s 25 provinces, officials said. There is no Ebola in the capital, Kinshasa, but doctors there say patients have started to flee crowded hospitals to avoid those arriving with the new coronavirus. The medical emergency in Congo is spotlighting a lethal trade-off for poorer nations in the time of Covid-19, in which responding to the pandemic could harm the fight against other infectious diseases such as Ebola, cholera, meningitis, yellow fever and polio. A measles outbreak in Congo has killed 6,000 people since early 2019.  "

Corporate leaders are changing company operations and resetting assumptions, after having absorbed months of fresh information about how customers act with everyday life often marked by working and staying home, traveling less and social distancing. In response to the emerging environment, businesses are retooling pricing, store designs and production—for the immediate and long-term future. “It’s time for us to get back on the front foot,”  McDonald’s Corp.  Chief Executive Chris Kempczinskitold investors Tuesday. He said the hamburger chain initially had to work through the shock of the pandemic but is ready to ramp up marketing. It moved to a limited menu in the quarter, helping to simplify operations. Chevron Corp. , meanwhile, is preparing for oil prices to remain depressed. “Things are definitely better than they were in the second quarter, in particular in that April, May time frame. But we’ve got to plan for lower for longer,” said Pierre Breber, Chevron’s chief financial officer. Equity Residential ,  which has a portfolio of about 78,000 apartments across the U.S., reduced rents for the latest quarter, as executives said some renters don’t want to live in various dense urban areas right now.  Church & Dwight Co. , the consumer-product company behind the Arm & Hammer brand, added manufacturing capacity in the second quarter—including the installation of a new liquid-laundry detergent line at one factory—to accommodate increased demand.

In the June quarter, the world’s second-largest economy became a vital refuge for many of them as China’s rebounding consumer economy helped offset the damage from tumbling sales back home. In earnings calls for the quarter, senior executives from some of America’s best-known brands singled out China for salvaging what otherwise was a rough three months. “China offered a model of recovery, stabilization and then growth,” David Weinberg, chief operating officer of  Skechers USA Inc.,  told analysts on a late July earnings call. Overall, the sneaker company’s quarterly sales dropped 42% from a year earlier but were bolstered in part by 11.5% growth in China. Chinese retail sales rebounded more strongly in the April-to-June period than most analysts had been predicting earlier in the year, falling just 3.9% from the same time last year. That compared with a much steeper 19% drop in the first quarter, when large parts of China were locked down to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. U.S. retail sales, by comparison, declined 8.1% in the second quarter in year-over-year terms, according to the Census Bureau. Despite rising political tensions between Washington and Beijing, American brands have suffered little commercial fallout among Chinese consumers, enabling them to capitalize on the economic rebound in China.

The U.S. reported more than 59,000 new coronavirus cases, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Globally, the total number of confirmed cases surpassed 19 million, with the U.S. making up about a quarter of the tally. Nine states, Vermont, Texas, South Dakota, North Dakota, Nebraska, Massachusetts, Indiana, Illinois and Hawaii, have seen the seven-day average of new confirmed cases rising faster than the two-week average as of Aug. 6, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of Johns Hopkins data. That held true in 40 states a month earlier, so the data reflect declines in reported new cases in a swath of the country. The seven-day average for new cases has been falling for about two weeks, from around 67,000 on July 22 to 55,510 on Thursday. Since July 26, the seven-day average has been less than the 14-day average, a signal that case counts broadly are coming down. Comparing the one- and two-week averages of new cases helps smooth out anomalies in the data, such as lags behind in reporting. However, the recent drop in the number of reported cases could be tied in part to a decline in testing. In 25 states, the seven-day average number of tests per 1,000 people was down from a week earlier, according to data from Johns Hopkins. Testing and contact tracing are seen as essential to containing the virus. But demand has outstripped supply.  "

Last spring’s pandemic-driven closures affected 62 million pre-primary, primary and secondary school students, not to mention their parents. With the arrival of the school year, the temperature of the debate has risen. The second-largest teachers union, the American Federation of Teachers, is preparing for its members to go on strike if schools reopen without their assent. President Trump has expressed a desire to “cut off funding” for schools that don’t reopen. It doesn’t help that the debate is taking place during the 2020 presidential campaign and a late-summer rise in coronavirus-related cases, hospitalizations and deaths. The good news is that amid the heated rhetoric—and the genuine fear—the accumulating scientific evidence and real-world experience is reasonably consistent. We do have a path to reopening schools this fall, especially for our youngest children. For older children, the story is also encouraging but less definitive. We must start with the fact that school closures cause significant damage to children—damage that videoconferences cannot repair. In Boston, the city reported last spring that more than one in five public school children who participated in virtual learning dropped out. Low-income children, in particular, are less likely to have high-speed internet access at home and often lack the extracurricular educational opportunities that wealthier parents can provide. School closures also increase food insecurity, because 30 million children receive free or reduced-price meals through the National School Lunch Program. Children may be increasingly physically insecure as well. In a paper published this May in the online social-science journal SSRN, researchers found that Covid-19 school closures have led to a 27% decline in reports of child abuse. Because school personnel are often the first people to notice maltreatment, a decline in reported cases is possibly a sign that more child abuse is going undetected.  "

After the birth of each, her employer offered 12 weeks of paid maternity leave. She returned to work each time feeling conflicted and depressed over leaving her babies; in one instance, she needed antidepressants. She couldn’t quit because she was the family’s main breadwinner, and her employer turned down her requests to work from home part-time on grounds that she wouldn’t be productive and it would set a precedent for other employees. Because of Covid-19, my patient now happily works from home. Her company may get rid of its expensive Manhattan office and allow all employees to work remotely. She says the cost savings have been immense—and she’s scratching her head about why her bosses couldn’t have had this epiphany sooner, when she and her children might have benefited. Many mothers have similar experiences. Companies have resisted work-from-home arrangements due to institutional inertia and worries about productivity. Yet studies suggest these setups can work: In 2014, a Chinese travel-agency call center estimated each employee who worked from home saved $375 based on higher productivity, $1,250 in office expenses, and $400 from reduced attrition. Aetna, a pioneer in flexible working arrangements, shed 2.7 million square feet of office space, saving $78 million a year. When new mothers can work from home, they are able to focus on their work without feeling torn from their children. They can take breaks to feed, comfort and play with their children. Without a long commute, they have more restorative time for themselves. As a result, parents have more patience, and are less resentful towards their children. Children, who read and mirror parents’ emotional cues, are less stressed, suffer less separation anxiety, aren’t angry at their parents for being away at work, and learn to regulate their emotions—all of which has lifelong benefits. It has taken a pandemic to prove that it’s possible to integrate work into our personal lives. The justifications for requiring employees to be on site have melted away in favor of a more relaxed and trusting environment in which employers care less whether employees clock in than whether they complete their tasks. Everyone wins—maternity-leave advocates who have been fighting for this arrangement for years, employers, mothers and children most of all.  "

Companies world-wide spent a record $34.6 billion on cloud services in the second quarter, up roughly 11% from the previous quarter and 30% from the same period last year, according to research firm Canalys. Led by            Amazon.com Inc.’s      Amazon Web Services and            Microsoft Corp.’s      Azure cloud unit, the spending gains were fueled by soaring corporate demand for cloud-based collaboration and remote working tools, e-commerce, remote learning, and content streaming, the firm said. Jones Lang LaSalle Inc., one of the world’s largest commercial real estate services firms, said it shifted roughly 90% of its employees to remote work when the coronavirus struck, representing about 90,000 workers. The company, known as JLL, had been expanding its use of cloud services in recent years, as it shut down costly in-house data centers and increased adoption of cloud-based collaboration and productivity tools, said            Yishai Lerner,      co-CEO of JLL Technologies, a division of the company that oversees enterprise information technology. “When the world moved to remote work at the start of the pandemic, this cloud investment really paid off,” Mr. Yishai said. “We plan to continue investing in cloud,” he added, citing benefits such as faster time-to-market for new real estate technology tools, flexibility and lower costs. Across all sectors, strong spending on cloud services comes amid the economic fallout sparked by the crisis, which saw the pace of U.S. annual growth decline by a seasonally adjusted rate of 32.9% in the second quarter—the sharpest decline in more than 70 years of record-keeping, the Commerce Department reported last week. “Organizations that had applications running in on-premises environments were compelled to move them to the cloud, because if people couldn’t get to work, that data center was useless,” said Sid Nag, a vice president at IT consulting firm            Gartner Inc. Cloud-service providers essentially rent computer capacity and business applications to companies online on an as-needed basis, often charged through a negotiated subscription rate. Mr. Nag said cloud services enable chief information officers to spend less cash upfront, rather than scaling up on-premises data-center capability or acquiring traditional licensed software. Matthew Ball,      a chief analyst at Canalys, said cloud services that have supported emergency business-continuity efforts will prove equally important when businesses reopen, by underpinning workplace safety tools, such as occupancy monitoring and contract tracing.  A June report by technology-research firm International Data Corp. estimated that more than two thirds of global organizations in every industry are using cloud-based systems or applications in some form, including high adoption rates in manufacturing, health care and financial services. “Companies already living in the cloud are doubling down, while those late to the game are eagerly trying to catch up, to both save their business and remain competitive,” said            Eric Newmark,      program vice president at International Data Corp. Mr. Newmark, who oversees the firm’s coverage of Software-as-a-Service, enterprise apps, industry cloud and digital commerce, said companies with a head start in deploying cloud systems are proving to be much more resilient in weathering the crisis, compared with slower adopters. “Growing demand for cloud services has followed suit,” he said.

The number who were unemployed between 15 and 26 weeks rose by a seasonally adjusted 4.6 million to 6.5 million people last month, according to the Labor Department. The July reading is the highest on record for the category in data going back to 1948, and it is nearly double the prior peak, set in 2009 at the end of the last recession. It is an ominous signal that even as overall hiring improves, millions of workers are facing the prospect of being out of a job for a long time. Research has shown that the longer a person is out of work, the harder it is to regain employment. Economists attribute that to factors such as skills erosion and a bias among employers to hire those who are already employed or only recently lost their jobs. “If you’re out of work for a long time the long-term consequences can be really bad,” said Katharine Abraham, a University of Maryland labor economist and former economic adviser to President Obama. Consequences include a lower likelihood of finding employment, a higher likelihood of dropping out of the labor force and the potential for reduced wages when returning to work.  "

Among the losers: social media and—unsurprisingly in the collapse of professional league schedules during the first months of the pandemic—home sports viewing. While the opportunity for new audiences was unprecedented, these winners made key moves that contributed to their success.  "

The nation has entered a “new phase,” Dr. Birx said on Sunday. “What we are seeing today is different from March and April—it is extraordinarily widespread.” The American people have reached the same conclusion. In an NPR/Ipsos poll released on Tuesday, two-thirds of respondents said that the United States was responding worse to Covid-19 than other countries. More than 8 in 10 supported aggressive new measures by the federal government, including expanded testing. In March, President Trump rightly labeled the fight against the pandemic a “war.” But we are losing this war. By one estimate, more than 400,000 Americans are infected each day. Only about 60,000 are detected through tests. Many of the rest are asymptomatic and can infect others, risking an exponential spread of the disease. After falling in the late spring, the daily death toll is rising again. We have relied on poorly coordinated efforts among 50 states and thousands of local jurisdictions to solve a national problem. No one is ensuring the nationwide availability of testing supplies. Many states lack adequate testing capacity, resulting in delays that render the results useless. Outbreaks in each state have been traced to other states, distant and contiguous. The virus does not respect borders.  "

Doctors tried experimental drugs and tested other therapies in an effort to keep him alive. He was put on a ventilator and when its prolonged use posed a danger, they delivered oxygen directly through a hole cut in Mr. Mazzara’s throat. He survived.

The initiatives, overseen by information technology executives, are aimed at helping hotels dig out of what has been a dire season, with steep declines in occupancy, staff layoffs and a fear among some guests of contracting Covid-19. “Without technology, there’s no way those companies recover fully,” said Les Ottolenghi, who was chief information officer at Caesars Entertainment Corp. until last November. Caesars merged last month with        Eldorado Resorts Inc. The Morning Download delivers daily insights and news on business technology from the CIO Journal team. U.S. hotel occupancy collapsed from about 60% in February to roughly 22% in April, according to data analytics firm STR, owned by            CoStar Group Inc.      It has since recovered some, ending the week of July 25 at about 48%. But any recovery could depend on how safe guests feel. Darren Clark, vice president of technology at West Hollywood, Calif.-based Viceroy Hotel Group, said his role has expanded to include overseeing the use of cleaning technologies such as electrostatic sprayers. The sprayers, used to clean rooms at many locations, deliver an electric charge to a disinfectant to help the minuscule droplets adhere to surfaces. Eight Viceroy locations world-wide are currently open and another five will reopen soon, according to the company website. Mr. Clark is also working to reduce physical touchpoints in the rooms by rolling out voice-activated digital assistants such as            Amazon.com Inc.’s      Alexa. Guests can use the AI-based devices to control the lighting and operate the television, while avoiding touching light switches and remote controls. “It gives guests peace of mind,” he said. Guests can also ask the digital assistant for extra towels or request a late checkout, because the devices are integrated with IT systems such as the company’s cloud-based property management system, made by            Oracle Corp.  Guests who don’t feel comfortable interacting with staff at many            MGM Resorts International      hotels in the U.S. can process payment, verify their identity and obtain a digital room key through a mobile app on their phone. The technology, built by in-house software engineers, became available for guests at more than a dozen U.S. locations that started reopening in June. Some features of the contactless check-in technology were previously available to certain guests at the company’s Las Vegas and Springfield, Mass., properties beginning last year. Plans to bring the technology to other locations in the U.S. were accelerated by about six to nine months because of the pandemic, said            Atif Rafiq,      president of commercial and growth at Las Vegas-based MGM Resorts International, who oversees the technology division. “Technology is at the core of almost every element of the customer experience as we reopen,” Mr. Rafiq said. The company, which operates 29 hotels and casinos world-wide, posted a 91% decline in quarterly revenue last month. About 62,000 of the company’s employees were furloughed between March and June, but as properties have reopened, tens of thousands of employees have been brought back to work. Employment in the leisure and hospitality industry, which includes sectors such as accommodation and food services, grew by 2.1 million in June, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. But the industry has lost 4.8 million jobs since February. McKinsey & Co. research suggests it could take until at least 2023 for the hospitality industry to recover to pre-pandemic levels. RLH Corp.      , with more than 1,000 independently-owned and operated hotels, said in April it would reduce its corporate workforce by roughly 40% to about 100 full-time employees in a cost-cutting move that was accelerated by the pandemic. “The reality is the pandemic has impacted all of our staffing levels and budgets and forecasts,” said John Edwards, chief information officer at the Denver-based company, which is also known as Red Lion Hotels Corp. The company is developing software built by in-house employees to automate the way invoices are generated, for example. It is also using artificial intelligence-based software built by cloud communications firm BluIP Inc., based in Las Vegas, to answer questions from hotel customers via phone, such as those related to check-in time, restaurant hours and directions to the hotel. UiPath Inc., a New York-based provider of software that companies use to automate tasks, said it saw a 30% increase in new customers from the hospitality industry during its first quarter ending April 30, compared with the same period a year earlier. At RLH, “We’ve prioritized anything that has to do with automation,” Mr. Edwards said. Write to Sara Castellanos at sara.castellanos@wsj.com Copyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The goal is to boost the availability of real-time data and enable commercial customers to better manage inventory by closely tracking air, sea and ground freight, said Brannon Kuykendall, chief information officer of Crane Worldwide Logistics. Mr. Kuykendall, who took on Crane’s top technology role last month, said the Houston-based company is planning to expand its cloud-computing footprint and ramp up cargo-tracing capabilities powered by artificial intelligence, data analytics and connected devices. By combining these tools, predicting delivery times can take into account a broader range of variables as they happen, such as weather, traffic and other potential disruptions, he said. Customers can be notified of shipment delays in real time. The Morning Download delivers daily insights and news on business technology from the CIO Journal team. “It’s really becoming a big data game,” Mr. Kuykendall said. Even before the pandemic struck, many third-party logistics firms were developing smarter systems, including AI-powered delivery software and autonomous warehouse robots, to keep pace with a rising demand for the speedier deliveries required by e-commerce. Over the past five years, total U.S. venture-capital investments in logistics-focused robotics and automation makers have topped $1 billion, according to data firm PitchBook. The pandemic exposed weaknesses in complex supply chains, as global trade flows were jolted by travel restrictions, border closures and lockdowns to contain the outbreak. U.S. exports and imports both rose in June for the first time in six months, but remained well below levels in February, the Commerce Department reported last month. The gains in exports were fueled by a 14% increase in shipments of goods, the agency said. Many businesses are also dealing with unpredictable swings in consumer demand, wreaking havoc on inventory management. To cope, logistics firms need to leverage advanced technology to be as agile as possible and quickly adapt to shifting market conditions, according to a recent report by the International Finance Corp., an investment arm of the World Bank Group. Logistics firms with robust digital capabilities allowing them to provide improved cargo visibility and tracking will be at an advantage as global economies begin to reopen, the report said. Among other tools, the IFC report lists cloud computing, automation and data analytics as key near-term investments, along with ongoing funding to develop robotics, drones and autonomous vehicles. By 2023, half of the world’s global leading enterprises will have invested in developing some form of real-time transportation-visibility software, according to information-technology consulting firm            Gartner Inc.  The fallout from Covid-19 is expected to drive a double-digit increase in demand for robotic goods-to-person systems over the next three years, Gartner said. “Being able to make better routing, pricing and overall faster and more quality decisions in a faster time frame, or even autonomously, improves our ability to get things where they need to be,” said Greg Aimi, a vice president at Gartner who covers global supply chains. By its nature, logistics is a multigeographic, multiparty management challenge, he said: “On-the-ground understanding of situations in remote locations is tremendously helpful in managing the turmoil caused by the disruption to normal operations,” he said. Crane Worldwide Logistics operates in 120 locations across 30 countries, and has over 2,300 employees, the company said. Its customers include global companies in the energy, automotive, aerospace and other sectors. “We have to get closer to real-time events and how they impact specific shipments,” Mr. Kuykendall said. “That’s a trend that the entire industry is now dealing with.” Write to Angus Loten at angus.loten@wsj.com Copyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The medical group asked the company’s insurer whether testing costs would be covered. The answer was no. Now Mott pays more than $30,000 a month to test 150 employees biweekly for the disease caused by the new coronavirus. The company has so far found six people who were infected but experienced no symptoms, Chief Executive Boris Levin said. Insurers don’t have to cover workplace Covid-19 testing that an employer does to broadly screen for infection among employees, according to federal guidance and Connecticut’s insurance rules. They are required to pay for tests a doctor orders as part of diagnosing or treating a patient, or for testing those who have been in contact with an infected person. Most large companies are self-insured and pay their own health-care costs. They have flexibility on how they pay for workplace screening programs. But for smaller companies that aren’t paying their own health claims, the ability to test workers often depends on what their health insurers are required—or willing—to cover.  "

The Fed has long resisted becoming the world’s backup lender. But it shed reservations after the pandemic went global. During two critical mid-March weeks, it bought a record $450 billion in Treasurys from investors desperate to raise dollars. By April, the Fed had lent another nearly half a trillion dollars to counterparts overseas, representing most of the emergency lending it had extended to fight the coronavirus at the time. The massive commitment was among the Fed’s most significant—and least noticed—expansions of power yet. It eased a global dollar shortage, helped halt a deep market selloff and continues to support global markets today. It established the Fed as global guarantor of dollar funding, cementing the U.S. currency’s role as the global financial system’s underpinning. Just as the Fed expanded its role in the U.S. economy to an unprecedented degree during the 2008 financial maelstrom, it has in the coronavirus crisis expanded its power and influence globally.  "

Public-health officials estimate more than 100 million Americans, including doctors and nurses, other essential workers and nursing-home residents, should get vaccinated before the general public because they are at greater risk of exposure to the virus or of contracting more severe Covid-19 disease. They were widely expected to get the first supplies after a vaccine is cleared. Yet initial supplies now look like they will cover only a fraction of the high-priority groups, if a vaccine clears testing and is authorized in the fall. There may be 10 million to 20 million doses available at first, according to a slide presentation prepared by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention staff and shown to a committee of outside vaccine advisers last week. A Trump administration official gave a roughly similar estimate during a call with reporters last week, too. “Given the initial anticipated supply, not all groups that are deemed a priority will be able to be vaccinated at once,” Dr. Sarah Mbaeyi, a CDC medical officer, said during the presentation to the vaccine advisers.

Anomaly Six LLC a Virginia-based company founded by two U.S. military veterans with a background in intelligence, said in marketing material it is able to draw location data from more than 500 mobile applications, in part through its own software development kit, or SDK, that is embedded directly in some of the apps. An SDK allows the company to obtain the phone’s location if consumers have allowed the app containing the software to access the phone’s GPS coordinates. App publishers often allow third-party companies, for a fee, to insert SDKs into their apps. The SDK maker then sells the consumer data harvested from the app, and the app publisher gets a chunk of revenue. But consumers have no way to know whether SDKs are embedded in apps; most privacy policies don’t disclose that information. Anomaly Six says it embeds its own SDK in some apps, and in other cases gets location data from other partners. Anomaly Six is a federal contractor that provides global-location-data products to branches of the U.S. government and private-sector clients. The company told The Wall Street Journal it restricts the sale of U.S. mobile phone movement data only to nongovernmental, private-sector clients. Numerous agencies of the U.S. government have concluded that mobile data acquired by federal agencies from advertising is lawful. Several law-enforcement agencies are using such data for criminal-law enforcement, the Journal has reported, while numerous U.S. military and intelligence agencies also acquire this kind of data.  "

Even though Riyadh is still far from that point, the facility’s exposure appears certain to draw concern in the U.S. Congress, where a bipartisan group of lawmakers has expressed alarm about Saudi nuclear energy plans and about Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s 2018 vow that “if Iran developed a nuclear bomb, we will follow suit as soon as possible.” It is also likely to cause consternation in Israel, where officials have warily monitored Saudi Arabia’s nuclear work. The Saudi Energy Ministry said in a statement it “categorically denies” having built a uranium ore facility in the area described by some of the Western officials, adding that mineral extraction—including uranium—is a key part of the country’s economic diversification strategy.

Her employer said its policy is to pay for only up to 80 hours of wait time, but she said her manager told her she must first return to work with a negative result in hand. The convenience chain didn’t respond to a request for comment about Ms. Hernandez’s situation. “Money was already getting tight and now I’ve been out for two weeks and a day,” said Ms. Hernandez, who is 10-weeks pregnant. Her husband’s income alone isn’t enough to keep up with their bills and after three weeks without pay, they have fallen behind. As Covid-19 cases resurge across the country, the demand for testing has soared once again, creating backlogs as long as several weeks. For many people, particularly essential workers who can’t do their jobs from home, longer waits can mean time without pay while they wait to be allowed back to work. Others have been forced to use vacation time.  "

Pakistan, one of China’s closest allies in the developing world, would receive doses to distribute to roughly one-fifth of its population of 220 million, under a deal that allows China National Pharmaceutical Group, also known as Sinopharm, to conduct clinical trials there.

In the West Chelsea district, a recently built ultra high-end boutique condominium known as the Getty slashed prices for its remaining units by as much as 46%. One full-floor, four-bedroom apartment at the Peter Marino-designed building was lowered to $10.475 million from $19.5 million. “Truth be told, you need to do something drastic and dramatic to attract attention,” said Ran Korolik, a partner at Victor Group, a developer of the project. “I didn’t want to reduce prices by 15% or 20% and then have someone come along and try to negotiate another 15% or 20%.” The crisis comes at a time when sales and prices in the luxury market were already under pressure. “It’s not like New York City is all of a sudden on sale. New York has been on sale for the past 24 months,” said Tal Alexander, a luxury agent with Douglas Elliman. “Sellers who are motivated and want to do deals need to add on another layer of discount.” The numbers are unprecedented. Between March 23 and August 16, sales of Manhattan homes were off 56% year-over-year, according to UrbanDigs, a real-estate data site. For properties priced at $4 million or above, sales were down about 67%."

As America’s most populous state struggles to contain the spread of the coronavirus, Gov. Gavin Newsom has identified the Central Valley as a key area of concern, sending $52 million in additional aid. Local residents and health experts say social distancing and other recommended steps are challenging for employees considered essential for picking and processing crops. Many work closely together in processing plants or return to crowded homes after a day in the fields, conditions that make it easy for the coronavirus to spread. “Some of those preventative measures aren’t as easily introduced in an agricultural setting,” said Matthew Constantine, Kern County’s director of public-health services. Kern County, which lies in the Central Valley’s southernmost part, had the highest per capita rate of new Covid-19 infections in California between July 31 and Aug. 13, averaging 56.2 new cases per 100,000 people, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of data from Johns Hopkins University and the Census Bureau.

The gatherings bring together four generations of her family; one reunion has been rescheduled for next year. The pandemic that has disrupted life around the world has also hit the family reunion. These gatherings, often held in the summer, require months of planning. For many Black families, they are particularly resonant. The Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture dates the tradition of family reunions back to Emancipation, when former slaves would place “Information Wanted” ads in Black newspapers to find relatives separated by slavery. “Sometimes we honor our ancestors at our reunions,” Ms. Brown said. Restrictions on travel and the size of gatherings have made in-person reunions a challenge for families across the U.S. In a recent survey of 1,000 adults by market-research consulting firm Longwoods International, between 48% and 53% said they had canceled travel plans in the final two weeks of March and each week in April. Between the weeks of May and July 29, the number hovered between 37% and 49%, but trended down in recent weeks as more people said they were figuring out how to travel safely.  "

In the first weeks of the pandemic, companies contending with government-ordered lockdowns, plummeting orders and closed stores reasoned that cutting pay could lower costs and stave off greater job losses. Many targeted higher-level executives’ compensation as a sign of solidarity with furloughed workers earning much less. By mid-July, roughly a quarter of major public companies reduced pay for CEOs and other executives, according to an analysis by consulting firm Compensation Advisory Partners. Now, a number of companies, including Walt Disney Co., General Motors Co. and  Yelp Inc.,  are restoring executive and some white-collar worker salaries to previous levels, while others are paring earlier pay cuts. At many firms, the moves reflect an acknowledgment that stressed-out workers—many juggling child care and remote learning—can’t work full-time for partial pay. They also indicate an economy increasingly cleaving to two tracks: one in which the livelihoods of white-collar professionals in certain industries have remained largely intact, and another for lower-income workers, many of whom work in service jobs in hard-hit industries such as hospitality, travel and retail. Millions of them have lost jobs, been furloughed or seen their hours cut. “When we first started out, it was like, ‘Yeah, everybody’s in this together, this is a tough time, we’ve all got to take sacrifices and pull together,’” said Susan Schroeder, a partner at Compensation Advisory Partners, who notes larger companies have been more likely to restore executive pay as smaller businesses continue to struggle. “Now that it has dragged on, I think things have changed a little bit.”  "

Among students slated to attend school in person, “there are worries about illness and germs and am I going to be able to see my grandparents if I go back to school,” says Muniya Khanna, a clinical psychologist and research instructor at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. Children may worry about forgetting masks or running afoul of social-distancing rules. And many students—whether they’ll be learning in-person or online—may be anxious about missing milestones and special events, such as dances and band concerts, like they did in the spring. We talked to psychologists about how to ease children’s back-to-school anxiety. Here’s their advice: Keep calm and listen. First, parents need to cope with their own anxieties, says Dr. Khanna.

The Democratic nominee is also promising a better virus strategy, which would be wonderful if he had one. But the virus plan he’s pushing is little different on the substance than what the Trump Administration is already doing. President Trump’s biggest mistake in the pandemic has been his own shifting rhetorical leadership. He’s moved from public nonchalance to worst-case shutdowns back to overconfidence and in recent weeks more focused concern. He has suggested that triumph over the virus is just around the corner, which defies reality, while minimizing the disease’s severity. Democrats this week hammered his constant self-congratulation and seeming lack of empathy, which have hurt in particular with older voters. But Mr. Trump’s virus policy in practice has been better than his critics claim, and Mr. Biden isn’t offering better ideas. Start with testing. Mr. Biden promises to “develop and deploy rapid tests with results available immediately.” Great—the Food and Drug Administration in the past week has approved two new rapid tests that can be scaled up quickly. The FDA and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention botched the initial testing rollout. And earlier this summer, shortages of chemical reagents and lab equipment led to delays in processing tests amid a surge of infections. But supply-chain hiccups are gradually being worked out. The U.S. is now conducting 700,000 or so tests a day, up from about 400,000 in early June and 100,000 in late March. More testing is vital to give Americans confidence to return to work and reopen schools, and the rapid tests that the FDA approved this week will help. The cheap saliva test developed by Yale researchers will avoid chemical reagent shortages and can cost as little as $10.  "

Mike Fratantoni, chief economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association, said he noticed the wide jumbo-loan rate variance starting in March. “I’ve seen a quarter- to a half-percentage-point range for exactly the same borrower,” Mr. Fratantoni said. Pre-Covid, the spread between offers made by a pool of lenders to the same qualified borrower would rarely rise above 10 basis points, or 0.1%, he said. Some mortgage brokers see even wider variance. Anthony Bird, owner of Riverbank Finance, a mortgage broker in Grand Rapids, Mich., said in mid-August he was searching for a 30-year fixed for a client buying a $900,000 house and putting 25% down. One lender offered the highly qualified borrower a 3.25% rate, another a 5% rate. Neither loan required paying points, Mr. Bird said. It is happening because important components of the jumbo marketplace—the correspondent and securitization channels—have gone nearly dormant during this crisis. The correspondent channel refers to banks, such as major player Wells Fargo, that used to purchase many jumbo loans originated by other lenders to hold them in their portfolios. Securitization refers to investors who buy up bundles of jumbo loans from the originating lenders; these private investors are required in this marketplace because government-sponsored entities such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac don’t buy jumbo loans. Both of these avenues to selling off a jumbo loan have dwindled in the Covid era, leaving most jumbo-loan originators owning the loans they approve and initially fund.  "

For many minorities, the disease is killing them in the prime of their lives.

For Latino people who died in that age range, the virus has killed nearly 25%, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of death-certificate data collected by federal authorities. The data show how deaths from the coronavirus are skewing younger for many minorities, a stark disparity that offers a clear picture of the pandemic’s outsize impact on vulnerable populations. This is especially the case for Latino people, in part because their high representation in jobs ranging from health aides to meatpacking have made it harder for some of them to dodge the virus, and because many have poorer access to care, according to public-health experts. “Latinos tend to be very, very poorly connected to the formal medical and public-health infrastructure,” said David Hayes-Bautista, who directs the Center for the Study of Latino Health and Culture at the University of California, Los Angeles’s medical school. As a consequence, the population has historically been hit hard by communicable diseases, he said.  "

When he scanned his feed on Dec. 30, he was stunned. Two leaked local-government notices warned about cases of unexplained pneumonia in the Chinese megacity of Wuhan. It was the first he’d heard of the outbreak, according to people close to him. The 58-year-old virologist called the head of Wuhan’s disease-control office, who confirmed the outbreak and revealed to Dr. Gao’s growing alarm that it had been going on since at least Dec. 1, with 25 suspected cases so far, the people close to him said. This wasn’t how things were supposed to work. Dr. Gao’s agency, known as the China CDC, was set up in 2002 precisely to detect and stop epidemics that often emerge from southern China. It was a mission that grew more urgent after a deadly outbreak that year of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS."

Finance chiefs are reducing the value of company assets such as airplanes, cruise ships and movie theaters in response to changes in consumer behavior that threaten the viability of their business models. “You have assets at least for a period of time generating zero—or close to zero—revenue,” said Steve Hills, who heads up the technical accounting consulting unit at Stout Risius Ross LLC, an advisory firm. The 2,000 largest U.S. businesses by market capitalization—from oil companies to airlines and restaurant chains—have been recording higher pre-tax impairments as existing assets and investments produce poor returns amid the widespread economic downturn. The Morning Ledger provides daily news and insights on corporate finance from the CFO Journal team. “If businesses can’t sell their products or services, the assets they’re holding are most likely worthless,” said Philip Keejae Hong, an accounting professor at Central Michigan University. Impairment charges totaled $261.7 billion for the first six months of the year, up 187.6% from the $91 billion booked during the same period in 2019. The first-half figure is also 29% larger than the $203.1 billion recorded in all of 2019, according to financial-technology firm New Constructs LLC. The total figure for write-downs in the first half of the year is among the highest for the past 20 years, but lower than such charges in all of 2008, when impairments hit $486.77 billion, and 2015, when they totaled $383.3 billion. Under U.S. accounting rules, companies have to take impairment charges, or write-downs, when the sum of estimated future cash flows from an asset is less than its book value. This applies to tangible assets—such as factories—and intangible assets such as brands or goodwill, which is created when one company buys another for a price higher than the fair market value of its assets. Write-downs usually mean that an asset has lost some of its value, while write-offs indicate a total loss of value. Oil giant            Chevron Corp.      impaired all of its $2.6 billion investment in Venezuela for the quarter ended June 30, citing the deteriorating operating environment in the South American country. “Our future capital decisions need to be more robust and more disciplined so that we don’t have impairments in the future,” Chevron’s Chief Financial Officer,            Pierre Breber,      said. “In this case, we took our book value down to zero,” Mr. Breber said, adding that the company aims to reduce impairments going forward. Fourteen of the 20 largest impairments in the first six months were booked by oil-and-gas businesses amid a decline in prices and pressure to reduce carbon emissions. Non-U.S. oil companies            Royal Dutch Shel      l PLC and            BP      PLC in June said they were writing down the value of their assets by $22 billion and $17.5 billion, respectively. Companies in other industries also marked down assets.            Walt Disney Co.      on Aug. 4 booked a $4.95 billion charge as part of its first quarterly loss since 2001. “This impairment reflects an underperformance of the international channels business that we were already seeing, and then that was exacerbated by the impact of Covid-19,” Disney CFO            Christine McCarthy      said during the company’s earnings call, referring to a division of non-U.S. TV networks. The international-channels business reported a 44% drop in revenue in the most recent quarter. Retailer            Macy’s Inc.      on July 1 recorded $3.2 billion in impairment charges due to changes in long-term revenue projections. Store closures contributed to a 45% decline in sales during the most recent quarter. Companies are expected to write down less as the economy recovers in the third quarter, said David Trainer, chief executive at New Constructs. “It’s going to generally move in step with the economy, which is better, and getting better, but still not as good as it once was,” he said.

Though they promise to make health care more personalized, our nonstop interactions with digital technologies and analytics are upending traditional notions of patient confidentiality. In the U.S., the core federal law restricting the use and protecting the disclosure of health data is the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA. Congress enacted it in 1996, when much of the health system was paperbound and fax-reliant. The law’s age is showing. Its disclosure rules, which took effect in 2003, don’t apply to personal health data in general, just the patient information flowing through the health-care system. Doctors, hospitals, pharmacies and health insurers are all bound by its requirements. But technology companies offering health-related services via sensors, apps and online portals may not be.

It hitchhikes across continents carried on coughs and careless hands, driven by its own urgent necessity to survive. It has a gregarious side that makes it hard to resist. It loves a party. The persistent social climber claims its victims around the world by riding on moments of the most innocent of human interactions—a shared laugh, a conversation, an embrace. And it is a liar. SARS-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19, often misleads the body’s immune systems. Taken on its own terms, SARS-CoV-2 is the infectious disease success of the past 100 years. Almost unmatched in the annals of emerging human contagions, it has parlayed a few chance infections into a pandemic of around 27 million confirmed cases so far. Doctors long expected the advent of such a virus, but even so, the shrewdness of the coronavirus caught many by surprise, and goes a long way to explaining how the world has struggled to contain it ever since."

In the past four years, President Trump, a longtime trade hawk, broke with decades of policy that broadly fostered closer ties between the two giants. Seeing China as a growing and often dishonest competitor, his administration has imposed tariffs on two-thirds of Chinese imports, moved to curb Chinese investments in the U.S. and pressured allies to shun Chinese technology. Advisers to Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden say they share the Trump administration’s assessment that China is a disruptive competitor. This suggests that even with an administration change in January, friction between China and the U.S. would remain high. Continued tension between the world’s two largest economies portends big shifts for global businesses as they rethink supply chains and technological systems in an increasingly divided world. It also would push allies into choosing between the two poles. “I think there is a broad recognition in the Democratic Party that Trump was largely accurate in diagnosing China’s predatory practices,” says Kurt Campbell, the top Asia official in the Obama State Department, now a senior adviser to the Biden campaign."

It has only gotten worse since then. Counties in states spanning the country, from Washington to Arizona and Florida, are reporting rising drug fatalities this year, according to data collected by The Wall Street Journal. This follows a likely record number of deadly overdoses in the U.S. last year, with more than 72,000 people killed, according to federal projections. The pandemic has destabilized people trying to maintain sobriety or who are struggling with addiction during a time of increased social isolation and stress, according to treatment providers and public-health authorities. In a survey of U.S. adults released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 13% of respondents in June said they had started or increased substance use to deal with stress or emotions related to Covid-19. The drug deaths are adding to the pandemic’s toll, which includes more than 188,000 infection-related fatalities, but also other deaths linked to factors such as disruptions in health care and economic dislocation. “It’s a pretty stark reality here,” said David Sternberg, clinical-services manager at the nonprofit group HIPS in Washington, D.C., which helps keep drug users safe and find treatment. “We’ve lost a lot of clients, a lot of patients.”  "

To help with anxiety issues, you schedule a virtual visit with your mental-health social worker. When it’s time for an in-person checkup, you head to the clinic to be evaluated by the nurse practitioner or physician assistant. And it’s all covered by your health plan. The traditional experience of getting health care is shifting away from the solo doctor with limited time to spend with each patient and few incentives to promote wellness. Instead, in the future, patients will be more likely to see a team of health-care professionals whose compensation is linked to keeping patients healthy. That team may be led by a doctor, but with a growing shortage of physicians, a nurse practitioner is increasingly likely to be in charge. Patients will also receive more care virtually and in nontraditional settings such as drugstore clinics. The Covid-19 pandemic is accelerating this restructuring of primary care, which has been gathering steam in recent years, driven by an aging population with multiple chronic ailments, rising costs, and concerns about access to care. That is especially true for racial and ethnic groups who have a higher prevalence of poorly controlled medical conditions, which made them more vulnerable to the effects of the virus. The most obvious way to offer care for more Americans is to take better advantage of a rising number of health professionals with the training and skills to do most of what doctors do when there are not enough doctors. The Association of American Medical Colleges projects a shortfall of as many as 55,200 physicians going into primary care by 2033. More medical students are opting for higher paying specialties. Meanwhile, the ranks of other health professionals trained in the field have been on a steady climb. The American Association of Nurse Practitioners estimates there are more than 290,000 licensed in the U.S., with close to 70% involved in delivering primary care. There are also about 131,000 physician assistants, with about 21% working in primary care. Nurse practitioners and physician assistants don’t have the same amount of education as doctors, who go through medical or osteopathic school and residency, and study disease more intensely. Although state and federal rules governing what they are permitted to do vary, both types of professionals are trained to diagnose illness, order and interpret tests, manage treatments, and prescribe medications.

We know Mr. Trump played down the virus threat at the time because he said so publicly many times. We wrote an editorial about it on March 12, “The Virus and Leadership,” warning Mr. Trump that voters would judge his Presidency largely on how he handled the virus. Q.E.D. Mr. Trump now says he was trying to keep people from panicking. And given his preoccupation with marketing, we believe him. We also know the President understood the virus was deadly, even if the risks weren’t fully clear, because he barred arrivals from China on Jan. 31 and Europe on March 11. His Administration’s Covid-19 record has also been better than he makes it sound—in mobilizing private-public efforts for testing, PPE and vaccines, and preventing a financial meltdown in March. His main failing has been inconstant rhetorical leadership. He has undersold the virus risks and oversold his own achievements when what the public has wanted all along is the candid reality. This is no small failing in a crisis. But we know all this because it is on the public record. This may be the most transparent Presidency in history, for better or worse. His faults and mistakes are on constant display, whether in his own voice or leaks to a press that wants him gone.  "

Gov. Andrew Cuomo wanted to say when and how it would happen. After Mayor Bill de Blasio told residents in a March 17 news conference to prepare to “shelter in place,” Mr. Cuomo dismissed the mayor’s plan in a television interview while his aides blitzed City Hall with calls. “The phones were ringing off the hook,” recalled Freddi Goldstein, the mayor’s press secretary at the time. “They said, ‘[The mayor] sounds crazy. He’s scaring people. You have to walk it back. It’s not up to you. It’s not your call.’ ” The federal government largely left the coronavirus response to states. While some governors ceded power to local officials, others centralized it. Mr. Cuomo, more than most state leaders, insisted that nearly every decision come from his office, including when to close office buildings, the size of weddings and the type of air filters required at shopping malls. Mr. Cuomo and his small team took command of the state Health Department and overrode local governments that wanted to go beyond the state’s social-distancing restrictions. That delayed the shutdown of the nation’s biggest city and slowed the reaction time as the virus spread in nursing homes, contributing to the nation’s highest death toll."

Last month’s motorcycle rally among the deplorables in Sturgis, South Dakota, contributed to 266,796 Covid-19 cases and $12.2 billion in public-health costs—or so claims a new study widely flogged by the media. Here is another example of how flawed statistical models can generate grossly exaggerated projections. The annual 10-day rally with live performances, races and bike shows drew 460,000 Americans from around the country to the small town of Sturgis (population: 7,000). South Dakota is among the few states that never imposed a shelter-in-place order or face-mask mandate. It has also let restaurants and bars operate without restrictions. Many in the media and various health sages warned that the motorcycle rally represented a “worst case scenario” for a “super-spreading” event. It would be surprising if the rally didn’t lead to at least some new Covid cases. But it’s impossible to know how many because there’s no data on how many attendees or their close contacts later tested positive. Never fear, the modelers as always are here. San Diego State University’s Center for Health Economics & Policy Studies sought to quantify the rally’s Covid impact in South Dakota and nationwide by analyzing the (anonymous) cell-phone data of attendees. They then compared case trends in counties with high, moderate and low numbers of attendees. They found that cases increased by 3.6 to 3.9 per 1,000 in South Dakota in the three weeks after the rally, translating to between 3,185 and 3,441 more cases statewide. To put this number in perspective, New York state has recorded as many cases in the last week even with its stringent public-health rules.  "

Senate Democrats filibustered the bill, though these are the same Democrats who say they’ll kill the filibuster if they run the Senate next year. Thursday’s filibuster exposes that Democratic spending demands are about exploiting Covid to bail out progressive states, not helping the public. With states reopening and the economy recovering, there’s no great need for new Covid relief. Congress has already appropriated some $2.9 trillion, and hundreds of billions haven’t been spent. The GOP recognized this by seeking to repurpose $146 billion from the $2.2 trillion Cares Act that passed in March, and reduce the size of the backstop for Federal Reserve loans, loan guarantees and liquidity for the financial system. The GOP bill still offered $257.7 billion more in loans and loan forgiveness for small business under the Paycheck Protection Program. Many small businesses continue to suffer under lockdowns and arguably need the lifeline. The GOP proposal at least required that applicants demonstrate losses, rather than the willy-nilly loan approvals of the Cares Act. The bill also included liability protection from Covid-related lawsuits for hospitals, health-care workers, businesses, schools, colleges and universities, religious, philanthropic and other nonprofits, and local government agencies. The idea is to create federal causes of action for Covid suits that pre-empt conflicting state laws and protect those who follow safety standards in good faith. Oh, and the bill offered states $300 a week in enhanced weekly jobless benefits, as well as $105 billion for schools, $16 billion more for Covid testing and surveillance by the states, and even $10 billion in loan forgiveness for the U.S. Postal Service.

The potential for another upended school year is bringing new urgency to the question of how schools should account for the students they say they are teaching. Also bedeviling educators are questions such as how to count students who don’t show up online for daily roll call but submit the required work. Students who miss 10% or more of school days have just a 20% likelihood of graduating, research shows. Enrollment numbers will soon be critical. State-by-state tallies taken in late September or early October will drive state and local funding. If schools can’t properly count children who are enrolled, funding might be skewed or cut. Federal funding is based on factors including enrollment, the percentage of students living at or near poverty, and children who have special education needs.  "

The preliminary order, the people said, was sent by Ireland’s Data Protection Commission to Facebook late last month, asking for the company’s response. It is the first significant step EU regulators have taken to enforce a July ruling about data transfers from the bloc’s top court. That ruling restricted how companies like Facebook can send personal information about Europeans to U.S. soil, because it found that Europeans have no effective way to challenge American government surveillance. To comply with Ireland’s preliminary order, Facebook would likely have to re-engineer its service to silo off most data it collects from European users, or stop serving them entirely, at least temporarily. If it fails to comply with an order, Ireland’s data commission has the power to fine Facebook up to 4% of its annual revenue, or $2.8 billion. Nick Clegg, Facebook’s top policy and communications executive, confirmed that Ireland’s privacy regulator has suggested, as part of an inquiry, that Facebook can no longer in practice conduct EU-U.S. data transfers using a widely used type of contract. “A lack of safe, secure and legal international data transfers would damage the economy and prevent the emergence of data-driven businesses from the EU, just as we seek a recovery from Covid-19,” Mr. Clegg said.

In two weeks, her son’s online-only classes start running from 9 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. If she can’t find child care, she will give up at least one of her two jobs as a home health-care worker to help her son manage his studies. “I don’t want to quit my job because it’s going to put us in financial strain,” said Ms. Vazquez, whose husband is a truck driver. “But I feel like I’m out of options.” It is a trade-off that looms for millions of families across the U.S. whose children are returning to partial or completely remote learning at K-12 schools this fall, and the potential blow to the economy could be big enough to rival a small or medium-size recession. According to research that Brevan Howard Asset Management recently shared with its investors, about 4.3 million U.S. workers could find themselves staying home unless they find other child-care arrangements. If those parents are counted among the unemployed, it would boost the unemployment rate by 2.6 percentage points, according to Brevan Howard. That would be a sharper increase than occurred in both the 1990-91 and 2001 recessions, though smaller than what occurred in the 2007-09 downturn, the researchers said. How do you think the effects of school shutdowns could be mitigated? Join the conversation below. A recent analysis by Barclays economist            Jonathan Millar      and colleagues found that the closures of all schools from September to December 2020 would result in a reduction of U.S. gross domestic product in 2020 on the order of between 0.4% and 0.8%. That compares with an inflation-adjusted GDP decline of 0.1% in 1991 and a slight increase in 2001. The release of these analyses comes as school plans remain in flux, with New York City recently delaying the reopening of classrooms, and as outbreaks have flared up at K-12 schools that have opened around the country. This rocky start is under way as the U.S. economy’s recovery brought the August unemployment rate down to 8.4%, from a peak of 14.7% in April during the height of pandemic-related business closures. Brevan Howard arrived at its conclusions by calculating that around 5.3 million working parents with children under the age of 14—the age at which children can likely be left at home by themselves—have full-time jobs that can’t be done from home, and lack another parent or adult to take up the child-care slack. Based on the school-reopening plans of the nation’s 100 largest school districts, which comprise around one-fifth of public-school students, Brevan Howard’s calculations suggest that at most around 19% of students are returning to in-person classes this fall. With around 81% of children attending classes from their kitchen tables, that translates to 4.3 million workers who will have to stop working unless they can cobble together another source of child care. Ms. Vazquez managed to keep working throughout the spring and summer largely thanks to the help of her extended family, who took on rotating shifts each week to watch the children. But her brothers, both of whom are agricultural workers, are now too busy with harvesting the region’s apple and pear crops. Other family members are struggling to manage their own children’s online studies. The cheapest commercial child care Ms. Vazquez can find charges $200 a week—which makes little financial sense given she currently earns $600 every two weeks. The demands imposed on parents by this new virtual school year this fall are, for many working parents, straining stopgap measures that had gotten families through the pandemic up until now. Mary Ann Shepherd said that helping her sons through virtual learning when their Mobile, Ala., schools shut down in the spring was manageable. Teachers were flexible about attendance and turning in assignments, and gave everyone a passing grade. “This is not like that—you can fail virtual school this time,” said the mother of four. Ms. Shepherd’s youngest son is attending pre-K in person while her three other sons’ classes are online-only. Her 5-year-old needs constant help with technology and assignments throughout his six-plus-hour school day. “There’s no way my 5-year-old would know how to go from one classroom to the next to the next assignment, and my two older ones—their class times are so different from the elementary program, there’s just no way they can help,” she said. Ms. Shepherd took leave from her job as a front-office coordinator for a staffing company when the semester began on Sept. 1, availing herself of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, which offers some workers partially paid family leave during the pandemic. But that only covers her for 12 weeks. Part of her frustration comes from the fact that neighboring school districts are open for in-person learning and Mobile’s high-school football teams—as well as sports leagues run through local parks programs—are allowed to play. Mobile public-school administrators say they will revisit whether to resume in-person learning in early November. Ms. Shepherd said she hasn’t let herself think about what happens if school remains virtual-only. “I’ve been so stressed out leading up to this that I just try to think that’s not going to happen,” she said. The effort to reopen schools is happening against the backdrop of the virus’s spread, prompting some parents to resist in-person learning. New York City’s Department of Education said on Aug. 31 that responses from families suggest that 63% of students will attend classes in person when schools reopen in a few weeks—down from 70% in mid-August. Monica Scott is living with those risks right now. The 34-year-old single mother of three in Lakeland, Fla., has a new job packing airplanes for Amazon, while working another job at            McDonald’s      on her off days. With no family network to rely on, Ms. Scott said she had no choice but to let her sons return to private school when it reopened this fall even though two of her sons suffer from chronic illnesses. On Aug. 29, Ms. Scott learned that someone in her 14-year-old son’s class tested positive. She and her son are now quarantining at home for two weeks. “It brings tears to my eyes,” she said. “It’s not fair that we have to choose between working to make ends meet and putting their lives in jeopardy. It’s not fair to them.” Write to Gwynn Guilford at gwynn.guilford@wsj.com Copyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

A pandemic could shut down the global economy, but it wasn’t enough to stop the American youth sports machine. Sahil is a pitcher who plays almost every position for his competitive travel baseball team in Atlanta, and this was supposed to be a glorious summer for 14-year-old athletes like him. But then something unexpected happened. He read his team’s safety protocols. He talked to friends about masks and risks. The more he thought about it, the less he wanted to play. “I’m not supposed to go out of my house, but I’m going to baseball?” Sahil said. “That didn’t make sense to me.” There were few teenagers more qualified to make this decision than Sahil. He didn’t need to experience a pandemic to start listening to public health experts. He’s been listening to them for his entire life: His parents happen to be infectious disease epidemiologists. Neel Gandhi and Sarita Shah, who are colleagues at Emory University’s Rollins School of Public Health in addition to being husband and wife, spend almost every waking hour these days thinking about Covid-19. Dr. Gandhi speaks in the measured tone of a scientist who strives to follow the data wherever it leads him, and that was especially important when the human variables were his own children: a son who was excited about the baseball season and a daughter who couldn’t wait to get back on the soccer field.

If Mr. Trump is going to stage a comeback, and not become only the fourth incumbent in a century to be denied a second term, he will have to make the race about policy differences and Mr. Biden’s indulgence to the Democratic left. If the race comes down to a character contest, Mr. Trump will lose. This isn’t a repeat of 2016 when Hillary Clinton was almost as disliked as Mr. Trump. Voters may have doubts about Mr. Biden’s capacity, but they don’t dislike him. Americans have also seen Mr. Trump in office for 42 months, and even millions of his supporters dislike the way he conducts himself. This isn’t merely a normative judgment. It’s a political fact as measured in the polls. Mr. Trump’s job approval rating rests at about 43%-44%, and his personal approval is lower. He hasn’t been able to sustain his job approval above what it was on Inauguration Day. Unlike Richard Nixon or George W. Bush, who won with pluralities the first time but majorities the next, Mr. Trump has failed to expand his coalition. Mr. Trump has reinforced the intensity of his core support. But in doing so he has shed support in the suburbs, especially among college-educated voters and women. This has been the case in nearly every election since Mr. Trump’s narrow victory in 2016. The Trump GOP is a smaller but more intensely loyal coalition. The GOP hope has been that this would change with Mr. Trump again on the ballot, and that millions of “shy” Trump supporters who refuse to talk to pollsters will vote like a new silent majority. Perhaps, but there is little evidence of this so far. Mr. Trump has narrowed his deficit somewhat since the GOP convention, but he trails Mr. Biden in the polling averages in every battleground state. It seems unlikely Mr. Trump can win the nationwide popular vote, so he will have to eke out another victory in the Electoral College.  "

The halt is a setback for the vaccine effort, which has long been touted as one of the world’s most advanced candidates. The shot had quickly progressed to late-stage studies in various countries, with AstraZeneca already signing contracts that could result in the delivery of initial doses this fall. The pause affects a study that began last week in the U.S. aiming to enroll 30,000 people, with funding from federal agencies. The study is testing whether the vaccine reduces the rate of Covid-19 cases compared with unvaccinated study subjects. AstraZeneca and Oxford had started a large study of the vaccine in the U.K. in the spring. The company is also testing the vaccine in studies in Brazil and South Africa.  "

Instead, health experts say it’s increasingly likely that several vaccines could pass muster in clinical trials and become available in phases over a period of weeks and months. A multiplicity of experimental vaccines provides bench strength in the event of more potential delays like the one  AstraZeneca  PLC encountered earlier this week, after a volunteer in a U.K. vaccine trial developed an unexplained illness, leading the company to pause studies to review safety data. Multiple vaccines would have implications for supply and distribution plans. If testing is successful, it’s possible that rollouts of vaccine doses could start as soon as this coming fall and stretch into 2021 and beyond. “I think the general public maybe has the wrong impression that there will be a winner and only one winner and everybody else will be a loser,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in an interview. “That’s not the case at all. I think it’s quite conceivable, if not likely, that you’re going to have multiple candidates that’ll get over the finish line that will actually be good enough to be approved for production and use.”  "

Diagnostic companies are racing to develop quicker, cheaper Covid-19 diagnostic tests, and tests that can be done at doctors’ offices, nursing homes and other places with the assistance of a medical provider are gradually becoming more widespread. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has authorized four such tests that are antigen-based, meaning they search for viral proteins. Test makers have vowed to produce tens of millions of these quick-turnaround tests in coming months, including  Abbott Laboratories  which recently unveiled a test that costs $5 and is the size of a credit card. Several companies also are working on at-home rapid tests that people can perform themselves. No test is currently authorized for complete at-home use, in part due to regulatory requirements for ease-of-use and accuracy. Covid-19 tests that don’t require a lab tend to be less sensitive than “gold standard” laboratory-based tests, meaning they are likely to miss more cases. But many public health experts now say that repeat testing can make up for the loss of sensitivity, and such testing could quickly identify the most infectious people and help bring transmission to heel as workplaces and schools resume in-person operations and as influenza season looms.

Because of the pandemic, live theater is almost entirely shut down, as are most movie theaters. Ballet companies everywhere have scrapped “The Nutcracker,” the cash cow that pays their bills for the rest of the year, and museums are leaving up the exhibitions that were on display in March. Yes, the art world is trying to sound optimistic, but the writing on the wall consists of two ominous words: social distancing. New York’s newly reopened Metropolitan Museum of Art and Museum of Modern Art are admitting only 25% of their regular capacity. The Houston Symphony reopens its 2,900-seat concert hall this Saturday, but it will play for only 150 people, while the Dallas Symphony is offering programs by “smaller orchestral ensembles” to be performed for audiences of no more than 75 in its 2,062-seat hall. While the prospects for 2021 may seem more encouraging, appearances are deceiving. Chicago’s Writers Theatre announced a truncated four-play season—but warned that “we do not plan to produce in our theatres until early 2021 at the soonest.” The catch lies in those last three words. The same conjectural specificity applies to San Francisco Ballet, which plans to resume performances on Jan. 19. But the title of the 2021 season is “Take a Leap of Faith,” and it isn’t hard to guess what that means. If you’re planning to subscribe, remember that you’re being asked to “take a leap of faith” and trust that the pandemic will have gone away by opening night. As for Broadway’s 41 theaters, some insiders are now saying that they may not reopen until the fall of 2021.  "

Its solution is straightforward, flexible and relatively easy to replicate. The country has averaged about 77 new daily cases since early April and recently suppressed a spike in infections. Adjusting for population, that would be the equivalent of about 480 cases a day in the U.S., where new daily cases have averaged about 38,000 over the same period. Total deaths in the U.S. due to Covid-19 just surpassed 200,000. South Korea halted virus transmission better than any other wealthy country during the pandemic’s early months. It was about twice as effective as the U.S. and U.K. at preventing infected individuals from spreading the disease to others, according to a recent report from a United Nations-affiliated research network. South Korea’s economy is expected to decline by just 0.8% this year, the best among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s forecasts for member nations. The key to South Korea’s success came from blending technology and testing like no other country, centralized control and communication—and a constant fear of failure. The nation fast-tracked approval of domestic testing kits as soon as cases began hitting. It tapped into its relative wealth and hyperconnectivity, blasting text alerts to citizens if infections occurred in their area. When the supply of face masks ran short early on in the crisis, the government seized production."

The researchers estimated that an extra 3,200 cases a day occurred in the U.S. that likely wouldn’t have happened had schools kept classes online. The team behind the report, slated to be posted online Tuesday on the preprint server medRxiv, included professors of epidemiology, health economics and higher education.

Sen Pei, an infectious-disease modeler and associate research scientist at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, called the study “well-designed.” Dr. Pei wasn’t involved in the research. To determine whether college reopenings influenced case counts in the larger community, the researchers used cellphone GPS tracking data to look at the movements of people—including an influx of students—and calculated the infection rates of the surrounding county from mid-July to mid-September, before and after students showed up.

The latest testing problems largely stem from a shortage of reagents, the chemicals used to process the tests, medical officials said. Some hospitals and other testing operations that spent months bolstering their capacity are now reverting to restricting Covid-19 tests to the most essential patients, as they did in the spring. Mark Steadham, president and chief executive of Morris Hospital and Healthcare Centers, about 55 miles from Chicago, said his facility could now conduct about a third of the testing it was doing this summer. That’s because in recent weeks, it has only been getting a third—and sometimes less—of its previous weekly allocation of 20 Abbott rapid-testing kits due to the reagent shortage. Each kit runs 24 tests. An Abbott spokeswoman said the company was continuing to expand its capacity given the high demand and that it was working with customers to supply as many tests as possible. Beginning in June, Morris offered widespread community testing, but is now limiting tests to patients who are admitted or are referred with Covid-19 symptoms. “We felt like we were just starting to get ahead of the virus,” Mr. Steadham said of the testing slowdown. His facility is the only provider of tests in surrounding Grundy County, population 51,000, and it has become difficult to assess how widely the coronavirus is spreading there, he said.  "

Through the end of August, the number of applicants rose nearly 17% from a year earlier, marking an interest not seen in more than a decade, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges, which administers the main medical-school entry exam. Compared with past years, this year’s numbers are unprecedented, said            Patrick Fritz,      a senior director with AAMC. Coronavirus has put a spotlight on health professions, prompting young people to apply to medical school earlier than they might have before, schools and admissions coaches said. Some applicants may be looking to take advantage of less strict application requirements this year. Many schools have dropped the Medical College Admission Test, or MCAT, exam requirement, or have pushed application deadlines further into the fall. In a year of massive job losses, some may be lured by what appears to be a stable career path. Sayak Ghosh,      21 years old, is graduating from New York University this December with a degree in neuroscience. He had been considering medical school when the pandemic hit and was moved by headlines about front-line workers. “Why can’t I be the one to be there that’s helping them?” he said he thought to himself. The New Jersey native has applied to more than 30 schools, for medical programs starting in the fall of 2021. Finishing his undergraduate degree remotely has left more time on his hands, he said, giving him more time to apply. Medical-school applications had been rising slowly since the 2008 recession, AAMC data show, but this year’s application cycle—which runs through the fall—has rocketed to nearly 50,000 through August. “Applicants and people that may have been on the fence before are all of  a sudden seeing this in the news and thinking, ‘Hey, I can do this,’ so there’s a huge spike,” said            David Flick,      associate director of advising at admissions consulting firm MedSchoolCoach, which works with college students, recent graduates and others interested in medicine. The new college of medicine at the University of Houston enrolled its first class several weeks ago, with most classes meeting remotely, except for certain anatomy and clinical-skills labs, which are held in small groups. The school fielded about 2,000 applications for 30 spots in the inaugural class. So far this summer, 4,000 applications have come in for next fall’s class, said            Stephen Spann,      the medical school’s founding dean. Some applicants, noting racial disparities in health—Blacks make up a disproportionate share of Covid-19 cases and deaths—say they want to close those gaps, Dr. Spann said. Houston’s new school was designed to train physicians to work in poverty-stricken, rural or other disadvantaged communities in Houston and Texas. “The pandemic has made students aware of the needs we have in health care in this country,” Dr. Spann said. The NYU Grossman School of Medicine is on track to exceed its application total from a year ago, helped in part by its offer of free tuition for all students, said            Rafael Rivera,      an associate dean for admissions and financial aid. The school’s applicant pool jumped from around 6,000 to more than 8,000 after NYU announced in 2018 that it would make medical school free. Some high-profile medical schools, including those at Stanford University and the University of Washington, have temporarily relaxed admissions standards by waiving MCAT requirements, even though the exam has long been a key assessment tool used to judge prospective students. This year’s waivers came after pandemic restrictions closed many MCAT testing sites. The University of Washington said it opted to make the test optional for applicants who hadn’t taken it by late July. Stanford is reporting an increase of more than 50% in its applications, with most submitting MCAT scores, said            Iris Gibbs,      associate dean at the school. “It was uncertain whether the administration of the MCAT could be safely and equitably done for all applicants,” she said of the medical school’s 2020 waiver. Some medical schools, including all universities based in Texas, have extended their application deadlines into October or November. Other programs are waiving prerequisites that were required in the past, such as internships in health or research projects, because many extracurricular activities were upended in the spring, said            Neha Vapiwala,      associate dean for admissions at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine. Christina Lucas,      25, of Jackson Hole, Wyo., wants to pursue a career as a rural physician. She works as a research associate at            FRISQ Holding,      a medical technology company, and said the pandemic motivated her. “At home you feel a little hopeless,” she said. “It just completely confirmed my commitment to medicine.” Write to Patrick Thomas at Patrick.Thomas@wsj.com Copyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The lockdown-loving media luxuriate in studies based on virus models that report bad news. They got another dopamine rush Tuesday when researchers from the University of North Carolina, University of Washington, Indiana University and Davidson College published a study linking the reopening of college campuses to 3,200 more cases a day in the U.S. They found an increase of 2.4 cases daily per 100,000 people in counties with college campuses that reopened for in-person classes versus those with colleges that stuck with primarily online instruction. To put these numbers in context, 3,200 equates to about 7% to 10% of the 35,000 to 42,000 daily reported average U.S. cases this month. The U.S. is recording 11 to 13 cases per 100,000 population each day, and states currently with “surges” like Wisconsin more than 30 per 100,000. Young people account for a large share of new cases in many states. Cases in Wisconsin among 18- to 24-year-olds spiked 220% between the week of Aug. 23 and Sept. 6 while ticking up 30% among those age 65 and older. The University of Wisconsin has reported 1,945 cases since students returned to campus last month. Yet colleges are also doing regular testing to detect asymptomatic and mild cases to stop outbreaks. Most colleges test students weekly, and some daily. Students who test positive are isolated, and their close contacts are typically tested too. This may keep the virus from spreading to more vulnerable folks who are more likely to get severely ill.  "

Now it has become an example of how summer tourism triggered a second wave of infections sweeping much of the continent. The fall from poster boy to hot spot came after the government, motivated by economic concerns, decided to open the coastal nation’s borders early this summer and woo the foreign tourists who have been a pillar of its economy. After becoming infected, the tourists returned home, taking the virus with them. Croatia has now become a case study in how international travel is acting as an accelerant in the pandemic. Like in Croatia, travel to and within other traditional tourist destinations has pushed the number of infections up across Europe, according to health-care officials. In France, domestic vacationers were linked to a surge in cases in the country’s south and along its Atlantic coast. Spain is experiencing record new infections concentrated in Madrid and tourism hot spots after a large influx of domestic and foreign visitors. While experts say that the resurgence of Covid-19 is driven by tourism-related travel to all vacation hot spots, the example of Croatia—a small Balkan nation that appears to have had an outsize role in the spread of the virus—shows how the European summer season unraveled some of the continent’s earlier gains in the battle against the pandemic. After the lifting of lockdowns, Croatian local authorities allowed clubs and bars to reopen in popular destinations along the Adriatic Sea coast, attracting visitors ranging from German students on a budget to Jay-Z and Beyoncé, who spent time there this month.

For the pandemic to stop, the coronavirus has to run out of susceptible hosts to infect. Herd immunity occurs when enough people in a population develop an immune response, either through previous infection or vaccination, so that the virus can’t spread easily and even those who aren’t immune have protection. To reach herd immunity for Covid-19, public-health authorities estimate that around 60% to 70% of a given population would need to develop an immune response to the virus. Some epidemiologists and mathematicians now say herd effects might start to kick in before that point, at perhaps closer to 50%, suggesting potential protection could be achieved sooner. Still, infectious-disease experts adamantly warn against the notion of trying to reach herd immunity to the coronavirus without a vaccine, as the costs on human life would be staggering and it likely wouldn’t happen soon, if at all. Even with a vaccine, there will still be barriers to achieving herd immunity. “It’s a continuous process,” said Saad Omer, director of the Yale Institute for Global Health. “You could start seeing [an effect] before that threshold, but the other issue is there might still be outbreaks at a smaller level.”  "

That number has shot up from 26% in August, according to data released Monday by the city’s Department of Education. Najib’s family’s experience with coronavirus played a major role in his parents’ decision. It all started in March, when Najib’s father, Rikers Island corrections officer Albert Craig, was sitting in a chair in the prison and was overcome by a dizzying fog and a sudden weakness that made the diabetic believe his blood sugar was severely high. Later at home in Brooklyn, he developed a middle-of-the-night fever and headache, and was diagnosed with coronavirus within days. As he lay watching the city’s coronavirus death toll rise, the quarantined 53-year-old Mr. Craig was overcome with a potent fear: that he would spread the virus to his wife and three children. Over the next several weeks, the African-American family experienced a “terrifying” chain of events that ultimately drove their decision to opt out of New York City’s hybrid school plan. Their other children, Nubian and Neyla, also will be taking full-time remote classes until their parents feel comfortable sending them back.  "

In addition, Russia says it is in various stages of talks with roughly 10 other countries to buy the vaccine. All told, it has received requests or expressions of interest in the vaccine for a total of 1.2 billion doses. The vaccines will be manufactured abroad and distributed world-wide from there as soon as November. The shot will require local regulatory approval before being distributed, officials say. The shot—called Sputnik V, after the satellite the Soviet Union launched ahead of the U.S. in the Cold War space race—was approved by Russian authorities early last month, despite skepticism from the West about the speed with which it was registered.

Some 51% of registered voters nationally say they would vote for Mr. Biden if the election were held today, while 43% back Mr. Trump. That 8-point lead remains largely unchanged from a month ago, when Mr. Biden had a 9-point advantage, and compares with an 11-point Biden lead in July.

Like their near cousins, stoops, steps, even fire escapes, porches offer a semipublic setting where we can meet friends and neighbors face-to-face—even if those faces are masked. In the words of Claude Stephens, founder of a tongue-in-cheek group called Professional Porch Sitters Union Local 1339, a porch is “the only place where you can feel like you are outside and inside at the same time; out with all of the neighbors and alone reading a book.” In Europe there are town squares and sidewalk cafes for fostering casual encounters, but there is something distinctly American about the front porch. Starting in the 19th century, every respectable house in the U.S. was built with a confident front porch. In an era when the backyard was devoted to drudgery—vegetable gardens, trash pits, outhouses, perhaps a chicken or goat—the porch offered an oasis of calm. “The front porch was an escape from the heat of the wood-burning kitchen stove,” explains historian Donald Empson, the author of “The Street Where You Live,” an architectural guide to St. Paul, Minn. “On the porch, in the cool of the evening, the family could gather to discuss the day’s events and exchange the latest news with neighbors strolling by.” Porches offered neighbors a place to exchange gossip, to spin sagas and sing songs, to flirt and court and air political views. The front porch at the turn of the century was  Starbucks ,  flash mob, church social and  Facebook  rolled into one. That started to change in the 1920s with the emergence of the automobile. A car meant that you were no longer tethered to the community in which you lived. You could drive to the beach or a friend’s house to relax instead of seesawing on a porch swing. Enclosed in a metal cocoon, you could speed past people whom you would have stopped to interact with if you’d been on foot. Modern ranch houses, split-levels and “little boxes made of ticky tacky,” as the folk singer Pete Seeger called them, had no time or space for front porches. In Levittown, the Long Island housing development that served as a role model for the post-World War II suburbs, almost none of the 2,000-plus houses came with a front porch.  "

Another used the wrong picture for St. Augustine, Fla. And one inaccurately said Rosa Parks was arrested because she didn’t sit in the Blacks only section on a bus, instead of correctly noting that she refused to give up her seat to a white man, said Ms. Kemerer, a third-grade teacher at Kapa’a Elementary School on the island of Kauai in Hawaii. Ms. Kemerer said she concluded the material wasn’t suitable, told her principal she didn’t want to use it, and stopped using the program for her class earlier this month. The online program, called Acellus Learning Accelerator and purchased by schools to help with remote learning, is sparking complaints from parents and teachers in Hawaii and elsewhere. Hawaiian parents by the thousands signed a petition and lodged complaints calling Acellus content racist, sexist and low quality, according to a Change.org petition and written testimony to the Hawaii board of education. Seven schools in Hawaii, four school districts in California and at least one school district in Ohio dropped Acellus this fall. Schools across the country had used Acellus before the Covid-19 pandemic, which drove a mass shift to online learning. But in places like Hawaii, its use before the pandemic had been limited to small home-schooling populations or for high-school students retaking classes for credit. This fall, Acellus became the primary remote-learning provider at two-thirds of Hawaii schools, covering nearly 80,000 students. As most of the country turns to remote learning, schools have purchased online curriculum to help with the transition. The online programs are designed to teach students without an adult supervising; some schools mix them with teachers leading a class via a video call. Many educators and experts say districts making the switch to online learning often lack the time or resources to adequately vet the material. Just 18 states have an online course review and approval process and at least three of them include Acellus.  "

Prices for ground beef and pork loins have returned to pre-pandemic levels, after surging as Covid-19 sickened meat-plant workers and forced shutdowns. Some products, including chicken wings and prime rib, are cheaper now than they were before the pandemic began, according to data from Nielsen. Rising production and lower overall demand are pushing down meat prices. Last spring’s plant closures left cattle and hogs lingering—and getting fatter—on U.S. ranches and farms. Meanwhile, fallout from the coronavirus has kept steakhouses idle and reduced meat exports. The result is relief for cash-strapped consumers, and more financial pain in farm country, where producers have struggled for years with low prices for livestock and poultry. Gordon Food Service Inc., one of the biggest U.S. distributors to restaurants, is selling some beef cuts for half what they cost a few months ago. Midwestern grocery chain B&R Stores Inc., which last spring restricted how much ground beef shoppers could buy, recently put it on sale at a discount.

Jobless claims increased slightly to 870,000 last week from 866,000 a week earlier, according to Thursday’s Labor Department report. The totals remain well above pre-pandemic peaks but are down significantly from nearly seven million in March. The labor market has added jobs in the prior four months after steep declines in employment at the beginning of the pandemic, helping bring down the jobless rate to 8.4% in August from near 15% in April. But the pace of gains has slowed recently, and persistently elevated jobless claims in September point to continued cooling in the jobs market. One reason is that layoffs have continued at a high rate. Some employers that held on to workers at the beginning of the economic crisis are now reducing their head counts because of persistently weak demand. A rise in coronavirus cases this summer triggered new business restrictions and related layoffs, and some small businesses that had relied on government aid to keep workers on payrolls had to cut staff when that money ran dry. The Labor Department will provide an updated look at the jobs market in September on Oct. 2. At the same time, many workers are returning to their previous jobs or finding new ones, but not at a high enough rate to offset overall job losses from earlier in the pandemic. Re-employment has contributed to a decline in the number of people collecting unemployment benefits through regular state programs, which cover most workers. So-called continuing claims decreased by 167,000 to about 12.6 million for the week ended Sept. 12.  "

That is creating a powerful boost that, while temporary in nature, investors shouldn’t ignore. The sapping of demand that hit during the first half of the year dealt a heavy blow to the economy, but what happened to inventories only made it worse. In the earlier stages of the pandemic, disruptions to global supply chains emanating from China led to shortages of the parts and materials manufacturers needed. Then, as Covid-19 gripped the U.S., factories and their suppliers sharply curtailed, and in many cases halted, production, further reducing inventories. Finally, as they were able to come back on line, many were leery of ramping up production, worrying that any rebound in demand as the economy reopened might be meager. When inventories get run down, gross domestic product gets depressed. That is because demand is being met by what is already on businesses’ shelves rather than new production. In the first quarter, when GDP fell at a 5% annual rate, 1.3 percentage points of the decline were due to falling inventories. In the second quarter, when GDP fell 31.7%, falling inventories accounted for 3.5 percentage points of the decline. But when businesses stop drawing down inventories, more production is needed to meet demand. If inventory levels are flat in the third quarter from the second, for example, GDP growth will be boosted by around 6 percentage points. The inventory effect in the third quarter may not be as large as that for the simple reason that maintaining inventory levels while meeting an unexpected pickup demand is hard. But if businesses merely draw down inventories at a slower pace in the third quarter, manufacturers will need to produce more, adding to GDP. That could set off what is known as the “bullwhip effect,” in which efforts to restock while meeting increased demand travel through supply chains, affecting finished-goods manufacturers, makers of parts and components and raw-materials suppliers.

Thousands of small firms have been driven out of business while their larger counterparts have largely survived and, in some cases, even flourished. The danger is that as a result U.S. economic power will reside in fewer hands, diminishing the innovation and entrepreneurship that have helped drive the country’s success. In 1989 businesses with fewer than 100 employees accounted for 40% of the workers employed by all U.S. firms, according to the Census Bureau. Newly released data show that as of 2018 that had fallen to 33%. Now it is almost certainly even lower. Small-business transaction data collected by software and business-services provider Womply show that about 1 in 5 businesses that were open in January have stopped transacting entirely. Most of them have likely closed for good. In a recent survey of 6,325 small-business owners conducted by small business social-networking company Alignable, 42% of respondents said they were at risk of going out of business in the fourth quarter. Big businesses are faring far better. While there has been an increase in bankruptcy filings among public companies, including high profile ones from department store  J.C. Penney ,  car rental giant  Hertz Global Holdings  and shale gas pioneer  Chesapeake Energy ,  so far they are running far below the numbers reached following either the 2008 financial crisis or the 2000 tech bubble. Moreover, to judge from the recovery in stocks since Covid first gripped the economy, investors aren’t terribly worried that a wave of failures is about to hit.  "

Some workers, companies and regions show signs of coming out fine or even stronger. The rest are mired in a deep decline with an uncertain path ahead. Just months ago, economists were predicting a V-shaped recovery—a rapid rebound from a steep fall—or a U-shaped path—a prolonged downturn before healing began. What has developed is more like a K. On the upper arm of the K are well-educated and well-off people, businesses tied to the digital economy or supplying domestic necessities, and regions such as tech-forward Western cities. By and large, they are prospering. On the bottom arm are lower-wage workers with fewer credentials, old-line businesses and regions tied to tourism and public gatherings. They can expect to bear years-long scars from the crisis. The divergence helps explain the striking disconnect of a stock market and household wealth near record highs, while lines stretch at food banks and applications for jobless benefits continue to grow."

Mr. Trump doesn’t do nuance, and he and his team have often acted recklessly, most prominently at the Rose Garden ceremony announcing Judge Amy Coney Barrett’s nomination. But scientists generally agree with his fundamental point that Americans need to learn to live with the virus. That’s also the message of a new declaration from scientists that the media are ignoring. Organized by Harvard’s Martin Kulldorff, Sunetra Gupta of Oxford and Stanford’s Jay Bhattacharya, the Great Barrington Declaration recommends that people be allowed to live normally while protecting the vulnerable. The authors are infectious-disease experts, and the statement by our deadline had been signed by more than 2,300 medical and health scientists and 2,500 practitioners, and counting. They describe their approach as “Focused Protection,” but it’s essentially what Sweden has done and even the World Health Organization is now recommending. Many European leaders including French President Emmanuel Macron are also slowly embracing it, though it still remains heresy on America’s left. The collateral damage from government lockdowns “include lower childhood vaccination rates, worsening cardiovascular disease outcomes, fewer cancer screenings and deteriorating mental health—leading to greater excess mortality in years to come, with the working class and younger members of society carrying the heaviest burden. Keeping students out of school is a grave injustice,” the declaration says. “Keeping these measures in place until a vaccine is available will cause irreparable damage, with the underprivileged disproportionately harmed.” Reams of public-health data and medical literature agree. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that there have been 93,814 non-Covid “excess deaths” this year, including 42,427 from cardiovascular conditions, 10,686 from diabetes and 3,646 from cancer. Many are due to government shutdowns of non-essential medical care.  "

Mr. Trump signaled his eagerness to turn the page on his infection as the White House grappled with a growing number of positive coronavirus tests. The Joint Chiefs of Staff are quarantining after attending meetings at the Pentagon with a top Coast Guard commander who tested positive this week, defense officials said. A military aide to the president who is among those responsible for carrying the “football” that contains launch codes for nuclear weapons has also tested positive, a person familiar with the matter said. The aide was the latest in a series of White House personnel—including at least three members of the press office—to test positive in recent days. On Tuesday, senior White House adviser Stephen Miller said he had tested positive for Covid-19 and was in quarantine. Mr. Trump said he intended to participate in next week’s debate in Miami against Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, scheduled for Oct. 15—two weeks after the president first tested positive. People infected with Covid-19 can stop isolating after 10 days have passed since the onset of symptoms, as long as they haven’t had a fever in 24 hours and their other symptoms are improving, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. For severe cases, the CDC says a person can be contagious for up to 20 days. Mr. Trump was given a steroid, dexamethasone, typically recommended for severe cases of Covid-19, in addition to a five-day course of the antiviral drug remdesivir and an experimental antibody drug cocktail, the president’s doctor, Sean Conley, has said. Dr. Conley said Monday it was possible Mr. Trump would no longer be contagious before the 10-day period ends.  "

The president is also tested for the coronavirus every day, as is anyone who comes in close contact with him. The administration relied on  Abbott Laboratories ’ ID Now rapid test at the Sept. 26 event for Judge Barrett.

The drugs, in a class of medicines known as monoclonal antibodies, have shown promise in early-stage patients with Covid-19. “That’s actually pretty exciting,” Mr. Gates told The Wall Street Journal’s CEO Council Summit. “The reduction in death rate there could be pretty high, and those will be out in volume by the end of the year, at least in the rich countries.” The drugs, developed by  Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc.,   Eli Lilly  and others, are designed in laboratories to mimic antibodies that the immune system produces to fight off viruses and other pathogens. They are injected intravenously and have the potential to work soon after a person is infected and only mildly ill. Scientists believe they also hold promise as a preventive tool, blocking infection temporarily. President Trump received Regeneron’s antibody drug cocktail late last week under a compassionate use program. Mr. Gates also expressed optimism about vaccines in development. An effective vaccine could help return life to “pretty close to normal” by late next year in the developed world, he said. Eliminating or stopping virus transmission completely would take two to three years, he said.  "

Kamala Harris sought to make the election a referendum on the Trump administration’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic in a debate just days after President Trump’s Covid-19 diagnosis, while Vice President Mike Pence said the Democratic presidential ticket’s policies were too liberal and would damage the economy. Over the course of a sometimes-testy 90-minute vice presidential debate Wednesday at the University of Utah, Mr. Pence defended the president’s response to the coronavirus, touted the economy and criticized Democrats’ fracking policies. With less than a month to go before the election, polls show a small slice of undecided voters up for grabs and Democratic nominee Joe Biden widening his lead. Ms. Harris tried to hold the Trump administration responsible for failing to stem the spread of the virus, criticizing Mr. Pence, who leads the White House’s task force on the coronavirus, for the climbing death toll. “The American people have witnessed what is the greatest failure of any presidential administration in the history of our country,” Ms. Harris said at the start of the Salt Lake City debate, which also covered the Supreme Court, taxes, fracking and the duties of the vice president. Ms. Harris said Mr. Trump has “forfeited his right to reelection” as a result of his handling of the pandemic. The vice president responded that Mr. Trump “has put the health of the American people first.”  "

Mr. Biden, the Democratic nominee, leads the president, 53% to 39%, among registered voters in the new poll, which was conducted in the two days following the debate but before news emerged that Mr. Trump had tested positive for Covid-19. Mr. Biden’s 14-point lead compares with an 8-point advantage last month and 11 points in July, which was his largest of the campaign at that time. The survey finds something rare in Journal/NBC News polling: evidence that an individual news event—the debate—is having a material effect on Mr. Trump’s political standing, at least for now. Significant events in the past, such as Mr. Trump’s impeachment by the House and acquittal by the Senate, had only hardened views of the president, not shifted them. Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster who directed the survey with Democrat Jeff Horwitt, cautioned that the poll was conducted during an unsettled moment after the caustic presidential debate—“a shock to the system,” he called it—and could reflect a temporary reassessment of views. “The public can be taking a moment to say, ‘What did I just see, and how do I feel about it?’” he said. Mr. Trump could regain ground, Mr. McInturff said, given that “he has a history of bouncing back to some set point.” For now, though, the poll represents a number of flashing caution signs for the president. His support has never before fallen below 40% on the ballot against Mr. Biden. Women, who outnumber men in the electorate, favor Mr. Biden in the survey by 27 percentage points, 60% to 33%, compared with 20 points last month. At the same time, support for Mr. Trump has softened among some of his most loyal groups, such as white, working-class men.  "

Authorities’ hopes that this was the result of collective immunity built as the disease spread rapidly through communities earlier in the year were dashed in recent days when a surge in new cases put Stockholm on track to reach last spring’s infection record. The new measures, in force for less than a week, recommend that all members of a household should isolate for a week if one of them becomes infected. Those unable to work from home will be eligible for sick pay. In addition, anyone experiencing cold-like symptoms such as a sore throat is encouraged to stay at home and get tested for Covid-19. So far, testing was only recommended for those experiencing clear symptoms of the disease, such as loss of smell or high fever. Anders Tegnell, Sweden’s state epidemiologist and architect of its coronavirus management, said his country would fare better through the course of the pandemic than nations that had imposed more stringent restrictions.

The 43,000-word text echoes some of the major themes of his social teaching, including the rights of migrants and the poor, with a special urgency inspired by Covid-19. “Once this health crisis passes, our worst response would be to plunge even more deeply into feverish consumerism and new forms of egoistic self-preservation,” the pope writes. “If only we might keep in mind all those elderly persons who died for lack of respirators, partly as result of the dismantling, year after year, of health-care systems.” But he writes that the experience of the pandemic also offered hope in the examples of ordinary people—cleaners and supermarket workers as well as doctors, nurses and priests—who risked their lives to keep society going: “They understood that no one is saved alone.”  "

But the agency removed the changes only days later, saying a draft version of the proposed changes had been posted in error. In its latest revisions to the guidelines Monday, the CDC acknowledged that tiny airborne particles that can travel beyond 6 feet can be infectious, though the latest wording says they aren’t the main way the virus spreads. The virus is primarily transmitted via respiratory droplets by people in close contact, including those who are physically near, or within about 6 feet of, each other, the CDC said. Those droplets, the agency added, cause infection when they are inhaled or deposited in the nose and mouth. The agency also recognized, however, that some infections can be spread by exposure to the virus in small droplets and particles that can linger in the air for minutes to hours. Evidence indicates that under certain conditions people with Covid-19 seem to have infected others who were more than 6 feet away, the CDC said.  "

Doctors said on Sunday the president could be sent back to the White House as soon as Monday, as they sought to clarify his condition after several days of contradictory information from doctors and advisers. Dr. Sean Conley, the president’s physician, said at a news conference on Sunday at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center that Mr. Trump’s condition “continues to improve.” But he also said Mr. Trump’s symptoms had been serious, adding that he tried to provide an “upbeat” assessment in a Saturday briefing. Dr. Conley said the president experienced two drops in oxygen saturation levels. Late Friday morning, before he was admitted to the hospital, it dropped below 94%, and he was given supplemental oxygen for about an hour. He experienced a high fever at the time, Dr. Conley said, without specifying his temperature. The 74-year-old president’s oxygen level also dropped on Saturday, this time to about 93%, his physicians said. A mildly obese patient of Mr. Trump’s age with oxygen saturation below 94% would typically be given supplemental oxygen for a half or full day and would be monitored to see if levels return to normal, said Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious-disease specialist and professor of medicine at the University of California San Francisco. Normal blood oxygen saturation levels range between 95% and 100%. Dr. Conley didn’t offer a clear answer when pressed about whether Mr. Trump required supplemental oxygen on Saturday, saying: “I’d have to check with the nursing staff. I don’t think—if he did, it was very limited.” He also declined to elaborate on what the doctors’ examinations of the president’s lungs had found. The White House didn’t respond to follow-up inquiries.  "

For the eighth time since October began, newly reported cases nationally ticked above 50,000, fueled by simmering outbreaks in every region of the country. For the past week, the seven-day average of new cases was outpacing the 14-day average in more than 40 states and Washington, D.C., according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of Johns Hopkins University figures. When the seven-day average is higher than the 14-day average, it suggests cases are rising. Hospitalizations also have swelled across the U.S. in recent weeks, though deaths haven’t yet surged. Deaths often lag behind new cases and hospitalizations, given the duration of the disease. The seven-day average of daily deaths attributed to Covid-19 has been hovering around 700 for about three weeks, down from around 1,000 two months ago. The U.S. has more fatalities than any other country in the world—more than 217,600 since the pandemic began. But it doesn’t have the highest percentage of cases that are fatal. About 2.7% of reported cases in the U.S. have been fatal, according to data from Johns Hopkins. That figure has declined in recent months as treatments have improved and testing has expanded, allowing more mild and asymptomatic cases to be detected. Since the summer, younger people have made up a growing share of new U.S. cases.  "

Mr. Trump—who didn’t wear a mask—spoke Saturday to supporters on the White House lawn. The president emerged from the White House pumping his fists, to cheers of “USA” from the audience of hundreds of pro-police activists. “I’m feeling great,” he said. In taped videos and brief appearances earlier in the week, the president had at times appeared short of breath, but sounded better in his nearly 20-minute speech. In a memo that evening, Dr. Sean Conley, the president’s physician, said diagnostic tests show there is “no longer evidence of actively replicating virus.” Mr. Trump’s remarks echoed the speeches he makes at campaign rallies, though the White House said the appearance wasn’t a campaign event. He attacked his Democratic rival, Joe Biden, as a socialist, touted his own record on the economy and said he wanted to send a message “to police officers of every race, color and creed: we support you, we honor you.” He concluded his remarks by urging supporters to vote. The event came two weeks after the president hosted a ceremony in the Rose Garden to announce his nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court, an event that Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has described as a superspreader event.

Respiratory viruses tend to spread more easily during the cold winter months, which in a typical year bring coughs and sneezes to the schoolyard and pneumonia and death to the most vulnerable elderly people. The risk for the U.S. and Europe this year is that Covid-19 cases multiply at the same time as other winter illnesses, overwhelming hospitals with sick patients. Public-health and infectious-disease experts say the risk of such a storm means governments need to prepare now for a difficult winter. That means working hard to reverse a resurgent pandemic before the colder months arrive. The U.S. recorded 50,700 new cases a day on average over the past seven days, equivalent to 154 cases for every one million residents, while together the 27 countries of the European Union and the U.K. recorded 81,600 a day on average, about 159 for every one million people. The number of people hospitalized with severe cases of Covid-19 has been rising, though it remains a fraction of that recorded during the pandemic’s spring peak. “It would be really good going into winter to have the number of cases of coronavirus as low as we can, so that we’ve got leeway and breathing space,” said Jimmy Whitworth, professor of international public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine."

If the preliminary results indicate the vaccine can work safely, Pfizer could ask U.S. health regulators to permit use by late November, Mr. Bourla said. The timetable, which Mr. Bourla provided in a letter posted to Pfizer’s website, suggests the shots could start going into use in late November, or more likely in December, since regulators would probably need some time to review the study data as well as Pfizer’s manufacturing operations. New York-based Pfizer is developing its vaccine candidate with German partner  BioNTech SE . It is far from certain the vaccine would prove to work safely in the trial now enrolling some 44,000 volunteers.

Hundreds of thousands of cancer screenings were deferred after worries about Covid-19 shut down much of the U.S. health-care system starting this spring. Because many cancers can advance rapidly, months without detection could mean fewer treatment options and worse outcomes, including more deaths. “There’s really almost no way that doesn’t turn into increased mortality,” with the full effects likely to play out over a decade, said Norman E. “Ned” Sharpless, director of the National Cancer Institute. Missed screenings and other pandemic-related impacts on care could result in about 10,000 additional deaths from breast and colon cancer alone over the next 10 years, the NCI projected earlier this year. Dr. Sharpless said the estimate now appears low. Cancer-care provider 21st Century Oncology, which has 300 locations around the U.S., said about 18% of its newly diagnosed breast-cancer patients this year through August had an advanced stage of the disease, compared with 12% in all of 2019. From 2015 to 2019, the share of its breast-cancer cases detected at an advanced stage was between 11% and 12.5%. The provider has also seen a higher proportion of its lung-cancer patients arriving with a more advanced stage of the disease this year. “It’s distressing as a physician,” said Constantine Mantz, chief policy officer for 21st Century Oncology, which is a unit of Australian company GenesisCare.

But this time—unlike in the spring—public-health experts broadly and increasingly agree, with some worried that the general public won’t cooperate with another monthslong, generalized lockdown against a disease whose transmission is now much better understood. The World Health Organization has long favored interventions that come with less economic and social disruption than lockdowns, recommending that governments pursue a strategy called “test, trace, isolate,” of sequestering people exposed to the virus. Western governments have found themselves with too few tests and not enough contact-tracing staff to follow that plan of action. Still, in recent days, WHO leaders have become more vocal in their encouragements that governments could do more to improve public-safety measures that would reduce the need for a second round of nationwide lockdowns. “What we want to try and avoid, and sometimes it’s unavoidable, we accept that, but what we want to try to avoid are these massive lockdowns that are so punishing to communities, to societies and everything else,”            Mike Ryan,      executive director of the WHO health emergencies program, told reporters on Friday. The United Nations agency isn’t alone. Thousands of public-health experts in the past two weeks have signed an open letter, according to its authors, asking governments to shield the most vulnerable parts of their populations and allow youth and healthy people to attain herd immunity. The authors of the letter, called Great Barrington Declaration, say they have pressed their case in discussions with U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services            Alex Azar      and            Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. Their views aren’t universally shared among epidemiologists, some of whom doubt whether immunity to Covid-19 lasts longer than a few months. The virus has proven often debilitating, and sometimes fatal, among the young and fit. The U.K.’s brief attempt to pursue a herd-immunity strategy became unfeasible, as hospitals overloaded and even relatively healthy people fell seriously ill—among them Prime Minister      Boris Johnson. Still, where public-health experts increasingly agree—including critics of the Great Barrington Declaration—is that the broad, monthslong lockdowns imposed in March may be too unpopular to sustain. Experts who backed lockdowns in the spring now worry another round of the same type could backfire if the public ceases to comply. Even proponents of more lockdowns are generally pushing for briefer, more targeted closures, dubbed circuit-breakers, in which governments would shut specific businesses for two or three weeks, such as bars, restaurants and possibly universities. Other institutions that appear to be lower risk—including day cares, elementary schools and outdoor facilities—could remain open. “The opinion of public health experts is changing very rapidly,” said            Jayanta Bhattacharya,      a professor of medicine at Stanford University, who is one of the co-authors of the Great Barrington Declaration. “In March, I felt alone. [Now] I think there are a very large number of public health experts, epidemiologists, and doctors who oppose further lockdowns.” 0 100 200 300 400 500 Netherlands 344.6 Belgium 364.1 Czech Republic 432.7 U.K. 242.4 France 285.7 ITALY 68.6 Spain 308.1 Note: Data as of Oct. 11 Source: European Centre for DiseasePrevention and Control The shifting attitudes toward lockdowns show how authorities are becoming more confident in their understanding of how Covid-19 spreads, even as the virus racks up unprecedented case counts. The world reached a record 350,000 daily Covid-19 infections last week, the WHO said Friday. A third of those were in Europe, where hospitals in some of the worst-hit countries—including the U.K., France and the Netherlands—have seen their average number of daily cases surge. In Britain, Mr. Johnson said on Monday that the number of coronavirus cases had quadrupled in the past three weeks and the number of hospitalized people with Covid-19 was the same as when the country locked down on March 23. He announced a three-tier system of restrictions but he said a total lockdown “would not be the right course.” The northern city of Liverpool was placed in the “very high” category following a rise in cases from Wednesday, and other northern regions are expected to follow. That will result in the closure of bars, gyms and casinos. Three temporary hospitals have been put on standby in the north of the country in case infections continue to rise there. In nearly all European countries, there are still far too few tests being conducted to break the chain of transmission by isolating only exposed people. In the U.K. only a fifth of people asked to self-isolate have complied, according to a research paper published in August for the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies. “In much of Europe and the U.S., these strategies have failed,” said Deepti Gurdasani, a clinical epidemiologist and senior lecturer at the Queen Mary University of London. “There is no shortage of advice and science. It’s just not being followed.” With cases spiking, governments across the European Union have imposed restrictions on international travel on their neighbors, hoping to stave off harsher impositions. Most countries restrict large gatherings, and in some places—like England, the Czech Republic and major German cities—bars have been told to close early. “If in the next couple of weeks we’ve not clearly managed to bend the curve, you will see a recommendation for some kind of lockdown,” said            James Naismith,      a director the Rosalind Franklin Institute, U.K.-government backed medical research center. But those could be more localized, aimed at particular hot spots, rather than nationwide, he and other public-health experts said. Western governments could block travel into and out of hard-hit zones, to limit the spread of the virus and the accompanying disruptions to other areas. Schools, he said, should remain open. “Public health is about what’s also doable,” Prof. Naismith said. “People are wary that public support for lockdowns could fragment.” In March, medical scientists lacked a consensus on how the virus spread, and backed sweeping lockdowns as a tool to buy time. At the time, there was little clarity on which age groups were most transmissive, or which interventions worked. From February into June, the WHO’s group of outside experts, and their counterparts at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, debated whether masks help, where and how the virus most easily spreads and which age groups are most contagious. Get a coronavirus briefing six days a week, and a weekly Health newsletter once the crisis abates: Sign up here. These days, there is a broad consensus on those questions. Cramped, crowded and poorly ventilated rooms where people are talking, shouting or singing are high-risk, such as bars, nightclubs or small restaurants. Elderly care homes require far more protection and testing of staff and visitors than they were afforded in the early months of the pandemic. Widespread mask wearing significantly cuts transmission. Spacious, outdoor settings pose far less risk. Children under 10 years old appear to experience milder cases, and don’t spread the disease as easily. While the WHO hasn’t issued a formal recommendation for schools to be opened or closed, some officials at the agency have expressed their personal viewpoint that the benefits of an education and a healthy childhood outweigh the risks, which can be managed. “We know where transmission takes place, we know riskier settings, we know how to control this and keep [the] economy and society moving,” said            Devi Sridhar,      professor of global public health at the University of Edinburgh. “I’m not for lockdown either. But let’s focus on what works.”  —Max Colchester contributed to this article. Write to Drew Hinshaw at drew.hinshaw@wsj.com Copyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Symptoms of the second case started in late May, a month after the patient reported his initial symptoms as having resolved. The two strains of virus were genetically distinct, signaling that it is unlikely that the man simply remained unknowingly infected with the virus in one, longer bout, the authors wrote. The paper notes that the patient’s second case of Covid-19 was more severe than his first, requiring supplemental oxygen and admission to a hospital after he suffered from shortness of breath. The Nevada case comes after similar reinfection case reports from locations including Hong Kong, the Netherlands, Belgium and Ecuador. The growing number of examples in medical literature bolsters evidence that immunity to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, might in at least some cases only last for a limited period, similar to coronaviruses that cause the common cold, researchers said. “We know that it certainly is in fact possible to be reinfected with this virus, and for the second infection to be as severe, or more severe, than the first one,” said Mark Pandori, an author of the paper who is director of Nevada’s state public health lab and an associate professor at the University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine. It still isn’t clear how common such reinfections are, he said.  "

The study, believed to be the largest of its kind, indicated that keeping child-care centers open doesn’t contribute to transmission of the disease caused by the new coronavirus, as long as they hew to sanitary guidelines like hand washing, small group sizes and staff wearing face coverings. The research has broad implications for the U.S. economy, parents who depend on day-care centers and child-care workers. More than a third of child-care centers in the country closed between March and July, according to Child Care Aware, an advocacy group. A June survey by the National Association for the Education of Young Children found that child-care center enrollment fell by 33% nationwide and that 70% of providers reported that parents told them they weren’t comfortable sending kids back to day care. “For parents, it might be a little bit of cold comfort, because they’re worried about their particular child,” said Dr. Walter Gilliam, a child psychologist at Yale and lead author of the study, published Wednesday in the journal Pediatrics. “But it’s clear that child care doesn’t pose a threat to communities.”  "

Machine-learning algorithms quickly detect anomalies in their lung scans. Scientists notice a pattern of strange infections in routinely collected blood samples. Whatever has sickened people is spreading, the samples suggest. Both systems send an alert to public-health authorities, who identify the new virus within hours, then deploy an army of investigators to contain it by isolating and treating those who are sick or have been exposed. One of the biggest lessons of the Covid-19 pandemic is that speed matters. The window of opportunity to find and stop a rapidly spreading virus is vanishingly small and intolerant of mistakes. “Once you get behind the curve on these epidemics, it is really difficult to turn it around,” said Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, which funds health-related research. “Acting late is a disaster.”"

Covid-19 vaccine injuries will be covered under a program known as the “countermeasures injury” compensation fund, which was set up in 2010 to cover harm resulting from vaccines for a flu pandemic, or drugs to treat an anthrax or Ebola outbreak, for example. This year, Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar said the countermeasures fund should also cover injuries from Covid-19 vaccines, giving drug companies immunity from potential liability lawsuits. But the fund isn’t expected to offer much of a remedy to the public, according to lawyers and vaccine experts. Since it began processing claims, the fund has paid out $6 million on 29 claims, averaging $207,000 per person, compared with $585,000 on average per person for an older vaccine injury fund. Behind the gap: The new fund has a tougher threshold for proving a relationship between an injury and the vaccine, experts say. The newer fund has a shorter statute of limitations, no avenue for appeals and doesn’t pay damages for pain or suffering like the older vaccine program does.  "

The changes the White House has sought—in many cases successfully—go beyond the agency’s public messaging. White House advisers have made line-by-line edits to official health guidance, altering language written by CDC scientists on church choirs, social distancing in bars and restaurants as well as internal summaries of public-health reports, according to interviews with current and former agency and administration officials and their emails. In one previously unreported Oval Office meeting, the president and top White House officials in May pressed CDC Director Robert Redfield to declare houses of worship essential and allow them to reopen. Later, they pushed to strip certain language from the guidance, current and former administration officials said. Both efforts were successful. More recently, aides to Vice President Mike Pence asked Dr. Redfield to have agency officials publicly substantiate an assessment by Mr. Pence’s doctor that it was safe for him to participate in last week’s election debate with Sen. Kamala Harris. Some CDC staff members worried that the request, which Dr. Redfield honored, drew the agency into partisan politics. The clashes stem in part from a turf war between a White House intent on controlling broad elements of the coronavirus response and federal agencies like the CDC who long prized their independence. Along with a series of missteps by the CDC itself, the sometimes-open tension has helped erode trust in the world’s pre-eminent public-health organization, compounding the difficulty of navigating a virus that has killed more than 217,000 Americans.

Twitter on Wednesday blocked users from posting links to the articles, initially citing a potential violation of its rules regarding hacked materials. The company later said the articles also violated its policies on displaying private information like email addresses and phone numbers without a person’s permission. Chief Executive Jack Dorsey said the company’s failure to give context around its actions was “unacceptable.” Twitter’s move came after Facebook also limited the distribution of the articles on its platform, saying it was awaiting guidance from its third-party fact-checking partners—independent organizations that routinely review the accuracy of viral content. Facebook has slowed the spread of the Post articles pending a decision by those partners, company spokesman Andy Stone said in a Twitter message on Wednesday morning. Mr. Stone said the action is in keeping with rules Facebook announced last year to prevent election interference.

Undergraduate enrollment tumbled this fall at many colleges and universities as first-year students’ plans were upended by the coronavirus pandemic. First-year student counts fell by 16.1%, and, overall, undergraduate populations shrank by 4%, according to the Clearinghouse data. Some of the reasons these would-be students have interrupted their college plans include not wanting to take classes online, concern over traveling to places that were considered Covid-19 hot spots and financial strains related to family member job losses. However, graduate student enrollment increased by 2.7%. Community colleges generally do well during economic downturns, attracting out-of-work adults looking to add skills and younger students trying to save money on tuition. But the data shows enrollment declined 9.4% overall and 22.7% for first-year students this fall. Doug Shapiro, executive director of the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center, said freshmen who declined to enroll in community colleges likely did so because of strained family finances or other obstacles, not because of personal preference for a campus experience. “I fear that many of those students will never get back,” he said. Enrollment at four-year public colleges and universities fell by 1.4% overall, and 13.7% for first-year undergraduates. At private, nonprofit colleges, those declines were 2% and 11.8%, respectively. This fall’s enrollment numbers exacerbated a longstanding imbalance in the gender makeup of college students. The number of men enrolled in undergraduate programs fell by 6.4%, compared with a 2.2% drop among women. Read the original article by Melissa Korn here. Copyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The 30-second Trump ad released last week says “President Trump is recovering from the coronavirus, and so is America” and goes on to note “together we rose to meet the challenge, protecting our seniors, getting them life-saving drugs in record time.” It then features Dr. Fauci saying “I can’t imagine that anybody could be doing more.” The quote was pulled from a Fox News interview in late March when Dr. Fauci was asked if he had ever seen as large a public response by an Administration to such a health threat. He responded: “We’ve never had a threat like this, and the coordinated response, and there are a number of adjectives to describe this, impressive, I think is one of them. We’re talking about all hands on deck.” He went on to detail the White House coronavirus task force’s ’round-the-clock phone calls and meetings. “So I can’t imagine that under any circumstances that anybody could be doing more,” he concluded. Dr. Fauci nonetheless took umbrage at his appearance in the Trump ad. “In my nearly five decades of public service, I have never publicly endorsed any political candidate,” he told CNN. “The comments attributed to me without my permission in the GOP campaign ad were taken out of context from a broad statement I made months ago about the efforts of federal public health officials.”  "

Over the past several months, Covid-19 has shaken traditional notions of where employees can work. In Silicon Valley, which has a relatively high cost of living and an employee base with access to state-of-the-art remote-work tools, companies are devising plans for a future with decentralized staffs. In some cases, changes can include cutting salaries by 15% or more depending on where someone moves. The nascent pay-cut movement stands to create tension between some of the most profitable companies in the world and skilled employees who enjoy high salaries. Companies point out that changing pay based on the local cost of living is standard practice for many organizations, including the federal government—with decisions to raise or lower salaries related to housing costs and other factors. Letting someone take a San Francisco salary to Wyoming could be considered unfair to present and future remote hires in cheaper cities who might receive a lower wage. But Silicon Valley companies have spent years going beyond standard corporate norms to endear themselves to their workers. In an era where companies rain free food, massages and yoga studios on their software engineers, the cold rationality of geography-based pay risks alienating employees used to being courted.  "

But feats of science were just part of the battle. Publicly funded Oxford needed to combine its high-minded ideals with the profit-driven ethos of the pharmaceutical world. Academics and their allies clashed repeatedly over control of the university’s strategy for delivering the jab to the world. “We were headed into the jungle without a machete,” says John Bell, a twice-knighted Oxford geneticist tapped by university leaders to find a pharmaceutical-industry partner. “We happen to be a rather good university, but universities don’t do this stuff.”"

Eighty doctors and public-health and medical researchers called the herd-immunity approach a “dangerous fallacy” in a letter published Wednesday in the Lancet. The researchers noted that it is still unknown how long recovered patients might be immune from the virus. Since the letter was published, more than 2,000 others have signed it in a show of support. This comes after White House officials outlined a federal strategy for dealing with the coronavirus in a call last week with journalists, pushing for a full reopening of society and citing a document written by three scientists that espouses immunity through natural infection. Scott Atlas, a radiologist and one of the president’s coronavirus advisers, touted the document during a television interview Thursday. “We just had a declaration written and the thrust of the declaration is exactly aligned with the president, that is opening schools, opening society, and protecting the high-risk people, the seniors,” he said. The document, called the Great Barrington Declaration, promotes an approach it calls “focused protection,” which pushes for young, healthy people to live life normally and get infected to build up immunity in the population, while working to better protect high-risk groups, such as the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions, like obesity and diabetes.

That’s especially true of his economic proposals, which a new study out Sunday from the Hoover Institution shows will have a damaging impact on growth, job creation and household income. Mr. Biden often cites  Moody’s ,  the credit-rating service, for saying his economic plan will yield faster growth and more jobs. “Wall Street,” he likes to say when he mentions Moody’s, as if that’s a conservative stamp of approval, even as he claims Mr. Trump is a captive of Wall Street. But everyone knows most economists at today’s big financial institutions have a Keynesian bias that posits consumer demand and government spending as the main drivers of growth. That’s certainly true at Moody’s, whose chief economist is Mark Zandi, who in our view underestimates the impact of higher tax rates and regulation in his economic calculations. This isn’t a personal criticism, but a factual statement about his economic model. We are also not predicting a “depression,” as Mr. Trump does, if Mr. Biden wins the election. On dire economic predictions, Mr. Trump is the mirror image of Paul Krugman on the left. The data show that the U.S. economy is recovering from the pandemic shutdowns faster than most economists predicted. Democrats may attempt to portray the economy as a disaster that requires trillions of dollars in new spending, but Mr. Biden would inherit an economy with strong growth momentum. The housing market is booming, small-business sentiment is bullish, and manufacturing is on the rebound. Once a Covid-19 vaccine is approved, and better therapies become more widely available, the economy should take off as even Democratic governors ease their lockdowns. The service economy will revive as Americans feel safer, and the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates low as long as it can get away with it. Mr. Biden could do nothing and inherit a boom in 2021 and 2022.  "

But recent data are shifting the discussion on school safety and infection rates of Covid-19. They argue strongly for opening K-12 schools. Previous evidence has suggested that schools are not superspreaders. That research came from other countries (whose rates and environments are different) or very specific cases in America, such as YMCA summer camps. While this suggested little impact on infection rates from opening the schools, it was possible that the unique environment of U.S. public schools would cause different outcomes. But they’re about the same. A group of researchers, spearheaded by Brown University Professor Emily Oster, have created and made available the most comprehensive database on schools and Covid case rates for students and staff since the pandemic started. Her data—covering almost 200,000 kids across 47 states from the last two weeks of September—showed a Covid-19 case rate of 0.13% among students and 0.24% among staff. That’s a shockingly and wonderfully low number. By comparison, the current overall U.S. case rate is 2.6%, an order of magnitude higher. Other research has shown that hospitalization and fatality rates for school-age children are also extremely low. People 19 and younger account for only 1.2% of Covid-19 hospitalizations in the U.S. during the peak of the pandemic. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that of all Covid-19 deaths up to Oct. 10, only 74 were of children under age 15. During the 2019-20 flu season, the CDC estimates, 434 children under 18 died of the flu. Yet we don’t shut down schools over the flu. What about teachers? We still don’t have hard information on the fatality rates for American teachers, but the new data have shown that Covid-19 case rates are low for staff working in the schools. That said, opening schools in other countries has had little impact on the fatality rates of teachers. Sweden never shut its schools, and teachers there have had the same fatality rate during this pandemic as IT technicians, who can often work from home. The cost of reopening the schools, measured in additional cases, hospitalizations, and fatalities, is low.  "

Human trials would need to start by April, he added, in case Europe and the U.S. had to go into lockdowns.

Joe Biden has an obligation to answer questions about his son’s influence-peddling and his own financial dealings—notably regarding China. The New York Post last week obtainedthe contents of a laptop purported to belong to Hunter. The Post has been transparent that it obtained its copy of the hard drive from Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who says he received it from the owner of a Delaware computer-repair shop, where it was abandoned in 2019. Mr. Biden derides this as a “smear campaign,” while House Intelligence Chair Adam Schiff calls it without evidence “Russian disinformation.” Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe says the government has no intelligence to support the disinformation claim. A repair-shop order from April 2019 contains Hunter’s name and what appears to be his signature. The shop owner supplied a subpoena showing the computer and hard drive were seized by the FBI in December 2019. And the Biden campaign hasn’t said the emails are phony. The emails regarding Hunter’s business in Ukraine have been widely reported. But as intriguing is a May 2017 email thread that includes a discussion about “remuneration packages” for six people as part of a business deal with a now-defunct Chinese energy titan, CEFC China Energy. The Chinese company was international news a few years ago, after the U.S. government charged a CEFC-funded organization with money laundering, and its CEO was detained by Chinese authorities. CNN reported in 2018 that “at its height” CEFC was “hard to distinguish” from the Chinese government. According to the emails, both Bidens were in line in 2017 to benefit from a deal with CEFC. One email appears to identify Hunter Biden as “Chair/Vice Chair depending on agreement with CEFC.” It also refers to financial payments in terms of “20” for “H” and “10 held by H for the big guy?”  "

In a statement to reporters Thursday, Anthony Bobulinski said that in 2017 Hunter Biden consulted his father about a planned venture with Chinese oil company CEFC China Energy Co. to invest in the U.S. and elsewhere. Mr. Bobulinski was also a partner. The venture—set up in 2017 after Mr. Biden left the vice presidency and before his presidential campaign—never received proposed funds from the Chinese company or completed any deals, according to people familiar with the matter.

Just weeks after bulldozers began rolling, though, President Trump came within a pen stroke of upending Mr. Prestage’s plans, preparing to announce the termination of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Trade battles with Mexico, Canada and China that followed cut into pork-producer profits in a three-year roller-coaster ride that threatened the Prestage family’s biggest-ever investment. “He’s made things more volatile, with the saber-rattling,” said Mr. Prestage, 65. “It does create a lot of angst and concern about, ‘Oh my God, what is he doing?’ ” Yet Mr. Prestage plans to vote for Mr. Trump, as he did in 2016. He and many other farmers say they believe a Biden presidency would bring stricter environmental regulations and higher taxes, among other concerns. Many are in competitive Midwestern states that might tip the election.

Across Israel, schools and most businesses are closed. People are required to wear masks in public, and outdoor gatherings over 20 people are banned. Police and city inspectors patrol the streets, handing out fines to rule breakers. Signs on highway banners and city billboards remind people to wear masks and social distance. But on a bright autumn morning in Jerusalem’s ultraorthodox stronghold of Mea Shearim, no police patrolled the narrow alleyways closed off behind stone walls. Thousands of children crowded into schools, and men, young and old, returned to their religious seminaries known as yeshivas, where they study all day. The only common sign in the neighborhood that mentions coronavirus is an advertisement for free ginger to boost the immune system. “After eight months of not doing what we’re told to do by my government, we’re still alive and healthy, so there’s no reason to close the Torah institutes,” said one ultraorthodox man in his 20s who was chatting outside a yeshiva. A deep distrust of the government and a desire to preserve a way of life is fueling a broad—but not uniform—backlash against government efforts to impose public health guidelines on the ultraorthodox community. Many members of the community also suspect the virus isn’t so dangerous as to disrupt the rhythms of their insular and conservative communities, in which many men study religion all day rather than work and gather thrice daily for collective prayers.

That echoes the experience of other professional sports that have played during the pandemic without transmitting the virus during competition. It’s everything else that’s the problem. Traveling and sharing a locker room are more suspect than humongous people tackling one another. And one ritual may be scarier than everything else: having dinner together. Breaking bread—as a team or in small gatherings—played a starring role in team outbreaks at Notre Dame and on both the Tennessee Titans and New England Patriots, for example. But those teams’ subsequent football games didn’t create additional problems: their opponents tested negative. Most teams haven't disclosed how they think Covid outbreaks have begun, but the leagues have flagged where they think problems lie by how they change their protocols.

That we would stand up to tyranny, lift up the downtrodden, free the oppressed, and fight for the righteous. WSJ Opinion | The 2020 Election: The Final Days, or Will It Be Weeks?			Join WSJ Opinion’s Paul Gigot, Daniel Henninger, Kyle Peterson, and Kimberley Strassel for a live discussion and Q&A on the race’s final stretch. October 21, 2020 at 8 p.m. EDT Now, the world no longer looks up to America. They have been witness to our dismissiveness, our lack of respect and our transactional approach to global issues. They have seen us tear up our treaties, leave our allies on the battlefield and cozy up to despots and dictators. They have seen our incompetence in handling the pandemic and the wildfires. They have seen us struggle with social injustice. They no longer think we can lead, because they have seen an ineptness and a disdain for civility that is beyond anything in their memory. But, without American leadership the world will indeed be transformed, just not in the way we hope. This could all change in November. We need a president who understands the importance of American leadership, at home and abroad. We need a leader of integrity whose decency and sense of respect reflects the values we expect from our president. We need a president for all Americans, not just half of America. This week I went to the polls in Texas. Truth be told, I am a pro-life, pro-Second Amendment, small-government, strong-defense and a national-anthem-standing conservative. But, I also believe that black lives matter, that the Dreamers deserve a path to citizenship, that diversity and inclusion are essential to our national success, that education is the great equalizer, that climate change is real and that the First Amendment is the cornerstone of our democracy. Most important, I believe that America must lead in the world with courage, conviction and a sense of honor and humility. If we remain indifferent to our role in the world, if we retreat from our obligation to our citizens and our allies and if we fail to choose the right leader, then we will pay the highest price for our neglect and shortsightedness. I voted for      Joe Biden. Mr. McRaven, a retired Navy admiral, was commander of U.S. Special Operations Command, 2011-14. Copyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Thousands of people began lining up at schools, town halls and indoor swimming pools that have been converted into testing centers by the military. The government has banned residents in the north from leaving their homes for almost any reason—unless they are on their way to get tested or can present a negative result. Officials said they would ask every resident older than 10 in the country of 5.5 million to get tested twice before Nov. 8. Those who refuse to get a test will be asked to stay at home for 10 days, or face fines of up to about 1,600 euros, equivalent to $1,891. Those over 65 are exempt from participating in the program but are invited to take part. Officials said testing centers would be open nationwide by the end of next week. Testing an entire population quickly when an outbreak is detected worked for the Chinese coastal city of Qingdao this month: Authorities tested more than seven million people after 12 cases were reported near the city’s port.

Hollywood producers and Imagine Entertainment co-founders Brian Grazer and Ron Howard said the future of cinema is heading into uncharted territory, speaking Tuesday at the WSJ Tech Live conference, which was held virtually. And in a separate conversation, Grammy-award-winning singer, songwriter and producer Jack Antonoff explained how Covid -19 has altered both his creative process and fans’ ability to discover new music. “I feel terrible for new and younger artists who need to be out there, performing [to establish themselves],” said Mr. Antonoff, who has produced songs for Taylor Swift, Lorde, the Chicks and St. Vincent, among others. “People are still making records, but what great talent have we missed out on because that path to pulling yourself up in the industry has gone?” Here are four ways Messrs. Howard, Grazer and Antonoff think coronavirus-related disruptions will impact the production and consumption of music, TV shows and films in the coming years. “Multiplex cinemas are going to become like Broadway,” said Mr. Howard, who has directed  Netflix ’s  coming adaptation of J.D.

Here’s what you need to know about how the region has handled the pandemic. Many Asian countries took drastic steps to stop the spread of Covid-19 early in the pandemic, including contact-tracing efforts, strict international travel restrictions, and quarantine programs, often in government-run facilities. Western governments haven’t been as stringent. “In the U.S. and Europe, we wanted to get our lives back, so we acted as if the virus was under control,“ says                Ashish Jha,        dean of the Brown University School of Public Health. “In Asia, they were not in denial. They understood they can have their lives back if they follow certain precautions.” In some Asian countries, wearing face masks was a widely accepted practice even before the pandemic, in part because of experience with outbreaks of SARS and MERS. “The advice is very consistent,” says Teo Yik-Ying, dean of the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health at the National University of Singapore. “It is how countries implemented and enforced that advice that is different. Asians were better at taking advice and putting in place the necessary rules.” People in East Asia are as or more likely than Europeans or Americans to wear face masks and sanitize their hands, according to recent polls by Imperial College London and YouGov. In moves that have drawn criticism from the West over privacy violations, South Korean investigators sift through smartphone data, credit-card records and CCTV footage to track down close contacts of those infected. People must scan QR codes with their phone when entering nightclubs, karaoke bars or movie theaters, to make it easier to track them down should an outbreak occur. In recent weeks, all but 20% of infection routes have been tracked down by South Korean health authorities. Meanwhile, voluntary tracking apps introduced in parts of Europe have failed to gain widespread usage. Read the original article by Margherita Stancati and Dasl Yoon here.

The length of four soccer fields, her keel nearly a hundred feet below her deck, Emma was far larger than any container ship ever before ordered and by far the most expensive. She was a bet on globalization: By transporting a container more cheaply than any other vessel afloat, she and her six sister ships were expected to stimulate even faster growth in international trade, lowering the cost of moving goods through the supply chains that had reshaped the global economy and turned China into the world’s workshop. The opposite occurred. Though supremely efficient at sea, Emma and the even larger ships that followed in her wake became a nightmare. By making freight transportation slower and less reliable than it had been decades earlier, they helped to stifle the globalization of manufacturing well before Brexit, Donald Trump and Covid-19 came along. Container ships are the workhorses of globalization. Operating on regular schedules—such that an identical vessel departs Shanghai every Wednesday, stops in Singapore nine days later and arrives in Antwerp five weeks hence, with tight connections to barges and freight trains—intermodal container transport gave manufacturers and retailers the confidence to plan tightly organized long-distance supply chains. Before Emma, each new generation of ships since the dawn of the container age in 1956 had been slightly larger than the one before. The rationale was straightforward: On a per-container basis, a larger vessel cost less to build and operate than a smaller one, allowing the owner to undercut competitors’ cargo rates and still earn a healthy profit. Their size was expected to give Emma and her sister ships an immense cost advantage on the most important route in shipping, the roughly 14,000-mile haul between China and northern Europe. Maersk forecast in 2006 that a global trade boom would double the demand for container shipping by 2016. Its concern was having enough ships to handle all that cargo. The major ship lines, almost all of which were state run or family controlled, felt compelled to follow Maersk’s lead. Megaship mania took hold, and orders for ships even larger than Emma flooded Asian shipyards. With the help of low interest rates and generous shipbuilding subsidies from the Chinese and South Korean governments, ships were to be had for far less than the true cost of building them. But the expected trade boom never occurred. Instead, international trade collapsed amid the financial crisis in 2008-09, and when it picked up again, its growth was far weaker than before. In the decade before the crisis, trade had expanded by 78%. In the decade after 2008, it increased less than half as much. Merchandise trade—exports plus imports—came to 51% of the world’s economic output in 2008, but hasn’t reached that share again.  "

Nor will you find any questions about Russian collusion, the Steele dossier, the Mueller investigation or Ukraine. Which is odd, insofar as battalions of reporters from those newspapers and the rest of the media pushed such “narratives” nonstop for more than three years to defeat this presidency. Sure would be nice to know how many people bought them. After all that, the 2020 presidential election comes down to a photo-finish, though the horses’ noses are frozen a foot from the finish line as we await a final call from various secretaries of state, litigants and likely the Supreme Court.

If it hadn’t been for Covid, this would have been a normal election, with Donald Trump’s policy record producing a second term and rioting in the streets.

While the national supply of protective equipment has improved since the first months of the pandemic, levels at some health-care facilities remain well below what regulators recommend. Many health-care facilities continue to ration and reuse masks, even as manufacturers have raised production, and some state health departments said they expect supplies to tighten further. States have been trying to build up supplies of N95 masks, which guard wearers from tiny particles including the coronavirus that causes Covid-19, and other gear like gloves since the start of the pandemic. A few have mandated that hospitals do the same. But the stockpiling efforts are being slowed by the increase in Covid-19 cases. In Michigan, for example, nearly two-thirds of health systems are reporting less than a three-week supply for one or more types of protective gear. The state’s health department recommends a 90-day supply.  "

Many are dealing with symptoms weeks or months after they were expected to recover, often with puzzling new complications that can affect the entire body—severe fatigue, cognitive issues and memory lapses, digestive problems, erratic heart rates, headaches, dizziness, fluctuating blood pressure, even hair loss. What is surprising to doctors is that many such cases involve people whose original cases  weren’t the most serious, undermining the assumption that patients with mild Covid-19 recover within two weeks. Doctors call the condition “post-acute Covid” or “chronic Covid,” and sufferers often refer to themselves as “long haulers” or “long-Covid” patients. “Usually, the patients with bad disease are most likely to have persistent symptoms, but Covid doesn’t work like that,” said Trisha Greenhalgh, professor of primary care at the University of Oxford and the lead author of an August BMJ study that was among the first to define chronic Covid patients as those with symptoms lasting more than 12 weeks and spanning multiple organ systems. For many such patients, she said, “the disease itself is not that bad,” but symptoms like memory lapses and rapid heart rate sometimes persist for months."

The shift reflects a deep anxiety about the West’s ability to maintain its living standards and technological edge while competing with giant state-backed companies in China and elsewhere in Asia. The trend is being accelerated by the Covid-19 pandemic, which has prompted a rethink of the balance between the state and private sector, as well as fresh ideas about how giant stimulus programs in Europe and the U.S. could be deployed to reshape economies. In the European Union, an export powerhouse that had long prized laissez-faire policies and free trade, leaders last month vowed to erect barriers to foreign competitors, repatriate production of key technologies, reduce dependencies in sensitive industries such as health, and create new digital champions. Italian state-backed lender Cassa Depositi e Prestiti last month took a stake in European exchange operator Euronext NV to support its buyout of the Italian stock exchange. Germany’s government recently demanded a 20% stake in national flag carrier Deutsche  Lufthansa AG , which was privatized in 1997, and two supervisory board seats, in return for a $10 billion bailout.

Polymun Scientific Immunbiologische Forschung GmbH is one of a handful of makers of lipid nanoparticles, microscopic vessels used to deliver genetic material into the body. For years, this was a niche application, used to deliver new forms of cancer treatment, for instance. Then came the coronavirus pandemic. Lipid nanoparticles are required in the manufacture of so-called mRNA vaccines, including the one developed by  Pfizer Inc.  and Germany’s  BioNTech SE  that is currently being tested in humans and is a front-runner in the global race for a Covid-19 shot. Such vaccines are made of genetic material that needs to be protected by a lipid nanoparticle before it can be injected into patients. This means a product few outside the most advanced fields of medical research had heard about until recently is now in high and urgent demand—similar to other parts of vaccine and virus-testing supply chains, from refrigeration equipment to certain chemicals and medical-grade glass."

More than six months later, it’s time for another look at the numbers. There have been small improvements, which some analysts have touted as signs of recovery. But as the numbers show, any recovery has been in many ways inconsequential so far. If you want a good measuring stick for the impact of the pandemic on airlines, compare what’s happening now to the industry collapse following the 2001 terrorist attacks. The six biggest U.S. airlines have experienced losses nearly twice as big as inflation-adjusted losses those same airlines, including their merger partners, had after 9/11. Following both events, government assistance propped up the airlines, which reduced losses. Even with that, the 11 airlines that now make up the six biggest had losses totaling $8.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2001 and the first quarter of 2002. Adjusted for inflation that totals about $12.4 billion. In the second and third quarters this year, those six airlines had combined losses of $22.5 billion. (The number is actually 1.8 times as big, but we rounded it.)"

Mr. Biden would take office without a mandate beyond addressing Covid-19 and not being Donald J. Trump. Mr. Biden will win the popular vote, and he may eke out a narrow win in the Electoral College. In essence he’ll have reversed Mr. Trump’s victory in 2016 with hair’s-breadth advantages in Wisconsin and Michigan, and perhaps Pennsylvania, Georgia and Arizona. None of them will be by large margins. He will have vanquished an incumbent President, which is no easy task. But look down the ballot, or across the country, and Mr. Biden’s potential victory looks remarkably limited and personal. Most new Presidents enter office having swept allies into Congress and statehouses as the public embraces his agenda and vision for America. Certainly this was true of Barack Obama in 2008 and to a lesser extent Mr. Trump in 2016. Mr. Biden had no such coattails. Democrats lost seats in the House, giving up some of the suburban gains they made in 2018 while continuing to struggle in rural areas. The full results won’t be in for weeks, but Speaker Nancy Pelosi may find her majority cut in half or more to the smallest in 20 years. Senate control may be determined by a Jan. 5 runoff for two seats in Georgia. But the GOP already looks to have won 50 seats to 48 for Democrats, who had expected to ride public dislike for Mr. Trump into the majority. A GOP Senate may compromise with Mr. Biden around centrist ideas, but the aggressive House agenda of the last two years would die again.  "

Former Vice President Joe Biden leads Mr. Trump, 52% to 42%, in the poll’s final reading of voter opinion before Election Day, essentially unchanged from Mr. Biden’s 11-point advantage in mid-October. In particular, women and seniors have turned against the president, the poll finds, with both groups favoring Mr. Biden by double-digit margins. However, the survey finds the race tightening when the landscape is narrowed to a set of 12 battleground states. Mr. Biden holds a 6-point lead across those states, 51% to 45%, compared with a 10-point lead last month. Mr. Biden’s advantage in swing states is within the poll’s margin of error and corresponds with the many swing-state surveys that show close races and a potential path for Mr. Trump to build an Electoral College majority without winning the national popular vote, as he did in 2016. “This election is probably the most competitive 10-point race I’ve seen,” said Republican pollster Bill McInturff, who conducted the survey with Democrat Jeff Horwitt. Mr. Trump’s support remains strong among his base of largely working-class, white voters, who are plentiful in the swing states.  "

When the new coronavirus outbreak hit the U.S. in force this spring, the rental-car industry sustained a dual blow: a steep drop-off in business as people and companies canceled travel plans and a nosedive in resale values for their fleets. The drop-off in used-car prices was particularly damaging for  Hertz Global Holdings Inc.,  helping to push the 102-year-old company into bankruptcy. But over the summer, the industry’s fortunes began to reverse. Used-car prices snapped back and even hit record levels in August as dealers grew tight on inventory. That market stabilization was crucial for rental-car firms because they regularly turn over their fleets and are sensitive to changes in resale values. Customers, wary of air travel, rushed to rent vehicles for road trips and business needs and as an alternative to using ride-hailing apps operated by  Uber Technologies Inc.  and Lyft Inc., executives and analysts say. These trends helped  Avis Budget Group Inc.  swing to a net profit of $45 million in the third quarter, reversing losses in the first half of the year, the company said Friday.

Evidence from studies using Vitamin D to prevent or treat Covid isn’t conclusive but some findings are promising, authorities say. Dozens of studies now under way are looking into possible links between vitamin-D deficiency and coronavirus. One, published online in JAMA Network Open in September, used data from 489 patients in Chicago. It showed the risk of testing positive for the disease was 1.77 times higher for people with a deficiency compared with those with adequate levels of vitamin D. Medical and nutrition agencies in the U.S., the European Union and the U.K. have recommended that adults supplement diets with vitamin D, particularly in winter. The U.S. and EU have suggested 15 micrograms (600 international units) daily are needed to optimize health. The U.K. recommends 10 micrograms to avoid a deficiency. The U.S. recommends that people over 70 have 20 micrograms daily. Susan Lanham-New, a professor of human nutrition at Surrey University in England, says most people will get about three micrograms a day through their diet, the other natural source being summer sunlight. Vitamin D can interfere with the effectiveness of a handful of drugs, but its main risks occur when levels in the blood get too high. All three authorities agree on a safe upper limit of 100 micrograms daily, and that doses beyond that don’t yield any extra benefit. Taking very large doses over time can do harm, authorities warn, leading to excessive blood calcium levels and damage to the liver and kidneys.  "

Mr. Biden is leading in enough states to win the Presidency, and if those votes survive recounts and legal challenges, he will be the next President. But whoever wins needs the other to concede to be able to govern. The result Americans on both political sides should want is one that most people think was decided fairly. Mr. Trump has every right to demand recounts if state votes are close, and to go to the courts for relief if there is evidence of fraud. Joe Biden’s lawyers are also in court, and they were for weeks before the election trying to ease mail-in ballot rules. Mr. Biden should also want the recounts and legal process to play out for the sake of his call to heal political rancor. As for fraud, the Trump campaign will have to prove it to prevail in court. It won’t be enough to charge that Philadelphia is historically corrupt, though it is, or that state election officials are partisan. The Georgia secretary of state is a Republican, by the way, contrary to Mr. Trump’s remarks Thursday night. The vote counting in Arizona and Georgia has seemed professional and transparent. The same can’t be said of Philadelphia, where the Trump campaign had to go to court so its poll-watchers could observe vote counting. Incredibly, Democratic lawyers opposed that Trump request. This is exactly the wrong way for Democrats to behave, feeding GOP suspicions. The vote-counting standard should be transparency for both sides to ensure public confidence.  "

With the FDA serving as gatekeeper for a Covid-19 vaccine, some Democrats and outside medical specialists questioned whether Dr. Hahn would put politics over science and rush a vaccine to market to boost Mr. Trump’s re-election chances. An answer came last month, when Dr. Hahn and his leadership team held fast to a rigorous vaccine-approval plan that was accepted by the White House after earlier objections, likely delaying any widespread distribution of the vaccine for weeks or months. “He stood up to Trump and he’s doing the right thing with vaccines,” said Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in La Jolla, Calif., and author of an open letter in August that said he was “gravely concerned” about Dr. Hahn’s leadership. “I’ve developed immense trust for him and his efforts.”  "

A national voter survey conducted for The Wall Street Journal and other news organizations showed President Trump with his strongest support among men, white voters without a college degree, rural residents and those who said the government should put a higher priority on the economy even if it increases the spread of the coronavirus. Democrat Joe Biden was more heavily favored by women, urban and suburban residents, nonwhite voters and college graduates. The AP VoteCast survey, which included more than 100,000 registered voters nationally, didn’t attempt to predict the winner of a race that has yet to be called. But it does sketch out in great detail the complex mosaic of the 2020 American electorate, a group expected to break a turnout record from 2016 when more than 136 million cast a ballot in the presidential race.

An avalanche of academic papers published since the start of the pandemic is broadening and deepening our understanding of the interplay between disease outbreaks and the economy. Once an esoteric corner of academia, this field, sometimes referred to simply as “epimacro” by its practitioners, is drawing in specialists from all over the world. So much so, the joke doing the rounds is that the only thing with a reproduction rate greater than the new coronavirus is epimacro research about the new coronavirus. Spain Confirmed Covid-19 deaths per million people, seven-day rolling average Total deaths 200,000 100,000 8 France 50,000 Italy 6 U.K. U.S. 4 2 Germany South Korea New Zealand Norway Japan –16% –12 –8 –4 0 Third-quarter GDP 2020, change from fourth-quarter 2019 level Note: Data through Nov.  8; Spain through Nov. 7 Source: Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (GDP); European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (deaths); the countries (populations) “When the crisis hit a lot of people dropped whatever they were doing and whatever they were working on, and just jumped into this. It seemed the big question of the day,” said            Benjamin Moll,      a macroeconomist at the London School of Economics. Suppressing the virus and saving the economy are often presented by politicians as competing goals. The reality, say economists and public-health experts, is they are closely aligned. If an out-of-control pandemic sickens chunks of the workforce or dissuades people from spending, economies would suffer even if the government does nothing. And countries that moved quickly to suppress the virus early on, such as South Korea or Japan, not only minimized deaths but avoided the economically ruinous lockdowns pursued in the U.S. and Europe to halt spiraling caseloads. “What appears to be a trade-off and an antagonism in the short term not only disappears in the long term, but actually becomes a synergy,” said            Stephen Kissler,      a researcher in public health at Harvard University. “Only by addressing the spread of the virus will we be able to tackle these economic problems.” Among some preliminary policy suggestions from this crossover field: Improve sick pay to incentivize compliance with quarantine orders; consider focusing lockdowns on sectors of the economy with a high risk of spreading the contagion while allowing others to operate more or less as normal; and test for the virus as widely as possible. The third suggestion is already catching on, with countries including China and the U.K. testing whole cities for the virus and tiny Slovakia testing its entire adult population. “What economics allows us to do is to quantitatively think about the cost trade-off between economic costs and mortality costs,” said            Maryam Farboodi,      assistant professor of finance at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Sloan School of Management. “And a strength is it lets us really quantitatively think about how individuals behave and how should policy makers react.” The field of economic epidemiology isn’t new. The HIV epidemic that took off in the 1980s triggered a wave of interest in economic questions associated with the virus, such as the role of poverty in fueling its spread and the most cost-effective strategies for controlling transmission. Influenza, similarly, has often attracted economists’ attention. A paper published as recently as September 2019 by the White House Council of Economic Advisers modeled a pandemic flu outbreak in the U.S. in which the worst-case scenario involved half a million deaths and an economic loss of almost $4 trillion. But the economics of disease outbreaks had until the coronavirus pandemic been something of a backwater in a discipline more focused on issues such as growth, employment and inequality. Eli Fenichel,      professor of natural-resource economics at Yale University, was writing about social distancing during an epidemic as far back as 2011. But he said he left disease outbreaks behind to focus on environmental questions because there wasn’t much interest in the subject from academic journals, and getting published was crucial to securing a top academic post. “It had gotten really hard by 2015, 2016, to publish anything,” he said. The current explosion of research into the economics of Covid-19, the illness caused by the new virus, can be broadly split into three significant areas, all of which have implications for pandemic policy. One, which builds on past work modeling HIV and other diseases, aims to incorporate into standard epidemiological models of disease some of the tools economists use to capture the intricacies of human behavior. The goal is to get a better picture of how diseases might spread in societies, rather than rely solely on epidemiological variables such as how many people on average a virus carrier will go on to infect. What can governments do to curb the spread of the new coronavirus and not damage the economy? Join the conversation below. “Epidemiologists are really smart, but they don’t have people in their models,” said            Martin Eichenbaum,      professor of economics at Northwestern University, who with colleagues published a paper in March that explored how the course of an epidemic can be affected by individual economic decisions and not just government interventions. A second area of focus is figuring out which public-health policies meet that goal of saving lives and minimizing economic harm. Papers have explored issues such as testing and contact tracing, school closures, mask wearing, protecting the elderly, and stay-at-home orders. “Back in the spring, I thought people were drawing far too sharp a view that it was basically a question of deaths versus jobs,” said            James Stock,      a professor of economics at Harvard University. In a study published last month, Prof. Stock and colleagues argued that widespread, mass screening for the virus using already-available $5 testing kits is a highly cost-effective way to control the epidemic. Their simulations showed the gains in gross domestic product and tax revenue far exceed the cost of conducting the tests. The third and most cutting-edge area of research is aimed at integrating epidemiological and economic models in ways they haven’t been previously. Prof. Moll at the LSE, for example, worked with colleagues at Princeton University and the University of Chicago to bolt together a souped-up model of a disease outbreak with a type of economic model more commonly used to explore the effects of central-bank policy shifts. In a paper published in September, they mapped out how different types of lockdown affect variables such as infections and deaths but also consumer spending and investment. Their paper also showed the consequences for income and wealth distribution of different policy choices. “The goal is to have an integrated model that you can use to run different policy scenarios,” he said. Experts in the field say the shortcomings in their work include limited data on the economic consequences of the pandemic and patchy knowledge of precisely how the virus behaves, which can affect the public-health and economic outcomes of their modeling. Flavio Toxvaerd,      an economic epidemiologist at the University of Cambridge and one of only a handful of experts world-wide who have made a career in this field, has been working with a model that shows what happens if, as some evidence suggests, immunity to Covid-19 is fleeting in those who recover from infection. His work suggests that in such a scenario low-level social distancing measures might be needed to manage future waves of the virus. Prof. Toxvaerd said the upswing of interest in the economics of disease outbreaks marks a change after a career in which people were interested in his work but often played down its importance. “Academically, it has been something of a vindication,” he said. “But I’m also extremely happy because I think these are really important questions.” Write to Jason Douglas at jason.douglas@wsj.com Copyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The positive, though incomplete, results bring the vaccine a big step closer to getting cleared for widespread use. Pfizer said it is on track to ask health regulators for permission to sell the shot before the end of this month, if pending data indicate the vaccine is safe. The timetable suggests the vaccine could go into distribution this month or next, though U.S. health regulators have indicated they will take some time to conduct their review. Then it will take months for the companies to make enough doses for the general population. “Hopefully now we can move on and get this vaccine out there and make sure it’s doing what it’s supposed to do and stop” the virus, said Kathrin Jansen, Pfizer’s head of vaccine research and development, in an interview. The findings came too early for researchers to assess the safety of the vaccine, which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has said must include two months of monitoring at least half the study’s subjects for side effects.

The number of hospitalized Covid-19 patients reached 65,368, according to the Covid Tracking Project, passing the record set Tuesday for the highest number of hospitalizations since April. A spring surge in the Northeast pushed hospitalizations near 60,000. Hospitalizations hit a nearly identical peak again in late July, as the pandemic’s grip spread across the South and West. Epidemiologists said the record is likely to be swiftly replaced by another  as Covid-19 cases soar nationally. “We already know this is going to go far north,” said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. The U.S. set single-day records for coronavirus cases three of the last seven days, reaching about 136,000 Tuesday, Johns Hopkins University data show. Demand for health-care workers is of heightened concern in the latest surge, said hospital and disaster-response officials. Cases are more geographically widespread, reaching more remote regions than the spring and summer. Federal and private pools of health-care workers typically draw from one state to help another.  "

Now, caseloads appear to have peaked across the region as a whole and in some countries are falling back rapidly. Progress is uneven, though, and leaders are wary of letting their guard down too soon. “This positive trend is recent, and therefore fragile, and will only produce results if it lasts,” French Prime Minister Jean Castex said Thursday. “It would be irresponsible to lift or loosen these measures now.” Governments are hoping that by bringing caseloads down significantly they can prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed and make it easier to keep on top of the pandemic with tools such as testing and contact tracing. The added hope now is a vaccine might become available within months.  "

But in July, she and her husband, Ron Hale, closed on a newly built house about 20 minutes away in Tolleson, Ariz. Her motive: The home was builder  Lennar Corp.’s  Next Gen design, featuring a first-floor suite with its own bedroom, living room, kitchen and bathroom. It would be the perfect place for Ms. Hale’s mother, 95-year-old Thelma Hall Williams, to live. “We did not want Mom in any kind of group home setting, especially because of Covid-19,” said Ms. Hale. When Ms. Williams, who only this year retired from a 72-year-long career in nursing, saw the new home “she said this was just good enough to give her sufficient independence, and me peace of mind,” Ms. Hale said. The Hale/Williams family is part of a shift that has emerged during the pandemic. It is a change that worries providers of traditional senior housing, but offers opportunity for other players. Covid-19 has caused occupancy  at assisted-living facilities and independent-living centers to slide by more than 2.5% in each of the last two quarters, the largest drop in occupancy on record, according to data from the National Investment Center for Seniors Housing & Care, a trade group for providers. The number of occupied beds at skilled-nursing properties has dropped even more, by just over 12% since the first quarter of the year, according to NIC. Meanwhile, home builders are selling more houses designed for multigenerational living and rolling out more new designs for people who want their elderly relatives to live with them. Builders of accessory dwelling units—the technical term for backyard houses that can function as separate living quarters—say interest has exploded since lockdowns began."

She is now 33 years old, lives in Tampa, earns $94,000 a year as a psychologist and says her education wasn’t worth the cost. She carries $300,000 in student debt. Dr. Wittern’s 37-year-old husband worked in a warehouse for several years before becoming an apprentice electrician. He expects to earn comparable money when he’s finished—minus the debt. When and if they have children, Dr. Wittern says her advice will be to follow her husband’s path and avoid a four-year degree. “I just don’t see the value in a lot of what I studied,” she says. “Unless they have a really specific degree in mind we’d both prefer they take a more pragmatic, less expensive route.” For traditional college students, the American postsecondary education system frequently means frontloading a lifetime’s worth of formal education and going into debt to do it. That is no longer working for millions of people, and the failure is clearing the way for alternatives: Faster, cheaper, specialized credentials closely aligned with the labor market and updated incrementally over a longer period, education experts say. These new credentials aren’t limited to traditional colleges and universities. Private industry has already begun to play a larger role in shaping what is taught and who is paying for it. For more than a century, a four-year college degree was a blue-chip credential and a steppingstone to the American dream. For many millennials and now Gen Z, it has become an albatross around their necks. Copyright © 2021 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved "

The economies of Europe plunged this year, and fresh lockdowns in many countries are weighing on nascent recoveries. Yet the unprecedented levels of government and financial-sector support, including repayment moratoriums sometimes covering a quarter of all outstanding loans, have kept households and companies afloat. That means banks haven’t had to recognize those loans as potentially soured. Even bank CEOs are wondering what happens when the support ends. “What we have is a very strange crisis” in which economies are falling sharply but defaults aren’t rising mostly because of the relief measures, Steven van Rijswijk, chief executive of ING Groep, said last week. “When these measures stop, what then will the picture be? We have limited visibility as of yet.” Regulators fear some European banks are too slow to react to borrowers’ potential troubles ahead. The European Central Bank said bad loans in the eurozone could soar as high as €1.4 trillion, equivalent to $1.7 trillion, if the economies fall even more than expected, a scenario the central bank said is severe but plausible. That amount would be more than during the aftermath of the financial crisis. The concern is that banks could run out of capital if they are suddenly overwhelmed by defaults, needing state support or even failing. What isn’t clear right now is how quickly those defaults could pile up, or if state programs might cushion banks’ losses for years to come. Elke König, head of a European Union agency set up after Europe’s financial crisis to handle troubled banks, said lenders need to act quickly to identify and deal with loans that are unlikely to be repaid. “There is no magic wand to make potential losses go away,” Ms. König said. European banks were already far behind U.S. rivals in recovering from that last severe shock in 2008. Then, U.S. banks got help from government programs and central banks to unload bad assets quickly, while banks in Europe became ensnared by a sovereign-debt crisis that curbed economic growth. Low interest rates, imposed to stimulate spending, further hit banks’ profits. This time around, U.S. workers who lost their jobs got weekly payments of $600 for several months, while others stayed at work because of Paycheck Protection Program loans to small businesses. While many U.S. banks let borrowers skip some payments, overall support has been less generous than in Europe. In Italy—where banks are still trying to deal with old bad-debt portfolios—over 25% of loans to businesses and 15% to households, totaling around €300 billion, were put under payment holidays, according to Marco Troiano, deputy head of the banks team at the ratings company Scope Ratings. The country was for a long time the epicenter of the virus outbreak in Europe and has been hurt by a collapse in tourism. In Portugal, where companies and the government are highly indebted, loan moratoriums to businesses covered almost a third of the total, according to the country’s central bank. Over half of the credit to companies in the hospitality and restaurant sectors are under the program. “Until the moratoriums are resolved, it will be challenging to assess the real extent of losses,” Mr. Troiano said. Carlo Messina, chief executive of the Italian lender            Intesa Sanpaolo,              ISNPY 0.88%            sounded upbeat in recent comments, saying that despite the pandemic his bank had the lowest-ever inflow of bad loans in the first nine months of 2020. In Spain and elsewhere, “customers’ behavior has been better than the guidance we gave in April and July,” said Ana Botín, executive chairman at            Banco Santander SA,              SAN 1.78%            a major lender in Europe and Latin America. Most borrowers restarted payments when moratorium programs expired, she said, and the ratio of nonperforming loans actually fell this year. Around €40 billion in loans, or 4% of Santander’s loan book, is still under moratorium, including many Spanish mortgages. According to an analysis by Spain’s central bank, the heaviest users of payment holidays are households that were already more financially vulnerable. It estimates that more than €52 billion of household and personal business loans in Spain, or about 8% of those that qualify, are currently on hiatus. Countries across Europe have also rolled out subsidies to companies so they could keep idled workers, preventing unemployment from shooting up. In contrast, the jobless rate had jumped in the U.S. Part of the reason for the rosy picture from banks comes down to accounting rules. Banks can typically count a loan as performing until there is actual deterioration, such as missed interest payments or a company going bankrupt. Andrea Enria, the head of the ECB’s supervision arm, said some banks are being optimists and waiting until there is concrete evidence a customer is going bankrupt. He told European lawmakers last month that banks shouldn’t let loans “rot in their balance sheets.” European banks are lending now, including more than €400 billion to businesses this year under government programs that guarantee a chunk of the repayment to the banks. The programs are giving companies much-needed cash to keep their businesses going, but they can also keep nonviable companies alive. How can banks prepare for the end of government rescue packages? Join the conversation below. Local cinemas, family-run restaurants and hair salons are among the businesses receiving such loans, according to announcements by banks, even though it is unclear when those sectors will fully recover. “At the moment the biggest bank is governments,” said Matt Long, head of capital markets for Europe at Accenture. “When that stops, that’s when we get to see the real ability of the borrowers to pay back the loans and meet their borrowing commitments.” Write to Patricia Kowsmann at patricia.kowsmann@wsj.com and Margot Patrick at margot.patrick@wsj.com Copyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

If the interim results hold, this could lead to a mid-2021 pandemic exit—and perhaps spare us from the lockdown instincts of the coronavirus team that Joe Biden announced Monday. The 90% rate is far above most expectations. The Food and Drug Administration has set a 50% effectiveness rate for considering expedited approval, and Europe has said it may approve a vaccine that is less than 50% effective. Annual flu vaccines are only 30% to 60% effective, and that’s in a good year. The 90% rate of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine would put it nearly on par with the measles vaccine, and it may also work with older people. This is not always the case with vaccines. Pfizer said there were no safety issues from its trials and that it could apply to the FDA as early as this month for expedited approval to distribute the drug. This also bodes well for the vaccine being developed by Moderna, the biotech startup, that is also in Phase 3 trials. Both vaccines use a new technology platform known as mRNA, or messenger RNA, that carries genetic instructions to cells. The apparent breakthrough is a credit to the innovative capacity of the private pharmaceutical industry. Pfizer has developed the vaccine using its own capital. That requires making a return on investment, which the politicians in both parties should keep in mind when they promise price controls on drugs. That would mean fewer resources to tackle the next coronavirus or deadly disease. The contribution from Operation Warp Speed, the Trump Administration vaccine effort, will nonetheless be critical in distributing a vaccine to market. The feds have promised Pfizer $1.95 billion to deliver 100 million doses to the federal government that will then be given to Americans free of charge.  "

That was the plan. Then the Covid-19 pandemic hit. Brazil went on a spending spree that is one of the most generous of any developing nation, but puts at risk the public finances of a country that has long teetered on the edge of a fiscal crisis. Brazil is facing a budget shortfall this year of more than 12% of gross domestic product, and public debt is on course to end this year at as much as 100% of GDP, up from 76% last year and far higher than the South American average. As the disease has ravaged the country, killing more than 160,000 Brazilians, Mr. Bolsonaro has been giving out as much as $10 billion a month to help the poor and shore up his popularity. Privatizations have been put on hold. The handouts have lifted Mr. Bolsonaro’s approval ratings to a record high even as he faces widespread criticism from health experts over his handling of the pandemic.  "

The research, published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday, was among the largest to look at asymptomatic transmission of the coronavirus. The study looked at 1,848 U.S. Marine Corps recruits between the ages of 18 and 31, who had been required to quarantine at home before arriving at the Citadel military college in Charleston, S.C., where they underwent a second 14-day on-campus supervised quarantine before beginning training. At Citadel, they were monitored every day for symptoms and were scheduled to be tested three times—once within the first two days of arrival, then on day seven and again on day 14. By the 14th day, 51 of the study participants had tested positive for the coronavirus. What was surprising to researchers: All 51 cases of Covid-19 were picked up by the prescheduled tests. None was detected as a result of additional tests given to individuals who reported symptoms. The findings come as coronavirus infections are surging, with the U.S. recently reporting a record 136,000 new Covid-19 cases in a single day. Daily caseloads have hit record levels in several states, and hospitalizations are at their highest level since the pandemic began. The total confirmed Covid-19 case tally in the U.S. has now surpassed 10.3 million.  "

The society is a conservative lawyers network whose members—including former White House counsel Don McGahn—have dominated judicial appointments and legal policy during the Trump administration. “Congress has no right to interfere with that work any more than we have the right to legislate,” Justice Alito said.

At age 85, he says, he is turning his attention to building bridges across partisan divides to find answers to sprawling social problems such as poverty, addiction, recidivism, gang violence and homelessness. His critics are skeptical, noting that his fierce Republican partisanship over the years blew up a lot of bridges. Mr. Koch has written (with Brian Hooks) a new book, “Believe in People: Bottom-Up Solutions for a Top-Down World,” which will be published on Nov. 17. It is part mea culpa, part self-help guide and part road map toward a libertarian America. Along the way, the book traces Mr. Koch’s life from hardheaded adolescent to student, engineer, industrialist, tycoon and political mastermind. The book suggests that he wants to add one final act: philosopher and, he hopes, unifier.

Produced by the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics Evaluation, or IHME, the study garnered immediate acclaim. More than 100 news outlets trumpeted the study’s findings in the days following its publication—“The Price for Not Wearing Masks: Perhaps 130,000 Lives” was the  New York Times ’s  headline—and a few hundred more articles have been written since. Reporting was often paired with calls for a national mask mandate, echoing President-elect Biden and now Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious-disease official. The study was also invoked by Francis Collins, head of the National Institutes of Health, to push for stricter masking requirements. Recognizing the potential importance, Nature Medicine rushed the study into print after an expedited peer-review process that took only seven days to complete. Unfortunately, the IHME modelers’ findings contained an error that even minimal scrutiny should have caught. The projected number of lives saved, and the implied case for a mask mandate, are based on a faulty statistic. Using a months-old survey, IHME modelers assumed erroneously that the U.S. mask-adoption rate stood at only 49% as of late September, and therefore had plenty of room to increase to “universal adoption,” defined as 95%, or to a more plausible 85%. According to more recent survey findings, however, America’s mask-adoption rate has hovered around 80% since the summer. New numbers would completely alter the IHME study’s findings. If 80% of Americans already wear masks, a new mandate could add only a few percentage points to the mask-adoption rate instead of nearly doubling it. Additional gains would be small and certainly nowhere near 130,000 lives saved. The study’s documentation suggests the 49% figure came from survey data collected by the data-analytics firm Premise between April 23 and June 26. Although the paper in Nature Medicine explicitly labeled these data as current as of Sept. 21, they weren’t. And other surveys paint a very different picture. The YouGov/Economist tracking poll finds that the U.S. mask-usage rate skyrocketed in late spring and hit 78% on July 14. It has hovered in the high 70s and low 80s ever since.  "

While previous vaccination programs have spread over years and focused on specific demographics such as children or the elderly, governments are hoping to do something they never have done before and inoculate a majority of the population in a matter of months. Even for rich nations with developed vaccination programs, that presents a host of problems including building new databases to track who is getting the shot, working out ways to encourage mass uptake among younger people, ensuring adequate supply and running large-scale inoculation centers where the shots can be safely and quickly administered. Those challenges mean that even if a vaccine is soon approved, it could be many months before it is administered to enough people to ease the need for lockdown measures that have been recently reimposed across the West. If a vaccine arrives, “is it enough to say that life will resume as usual? I think the answer is no,” said David Salisbury, who previously chaired the World Health Organization’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization.  "

A wellness coach who loves the outdoors and camping, Ms. Harris was browsing Instagram one day when up popped an advertisement for a rental from a company called Getaway House Inc. that instantly appealed to her. It was for a so-called tiny house on its own sequestered space in a rambling wooded compound near LaRue, Texas. Even better, it was just 90 minutes southeast of her Dallas home by car. She booked it immediately and says she spent a blissful long weekend soaking up the serenity. Tiny houses—typically dwellings smaller than 500 square feet but defined by some as “living simply in small homes”—aren’t new. The “tiny house movement” has been in bloom for more than a decade, a rebellion against a perception that American homes had grown too large, too expensive, too bland and too environmentally unfriendly. Now, tiny homes are surging in popularity as havens for travelers seeking safe and interesting harbors during the pandemic.  "

The news came more than a week after Pfizer and German partner  BioNTech SE  said an early analysis of the vaccine showed strong efficacy, and days after biotech  Moderna Inc.  reported similarly positive preliminary results for its Covid-19 shot. Such strong findings suggest that drugmakers can develop vaccines capable of protecting against infections causing Covid-19 and its symptoms, just as cases have again surged across the nation and some officials have reinstituted stricter policies meant to control the spread. Pfizer and BioNTech said that of the nearly 44,000 adults in the U.S. and in other countries who took part in the study, 170 developed Covid-19 with at least one symptom. Out of those, just eight had taken the vaccine, while 162 had received a placebo. The resulting 95% effectiveness rate puts the shot’s performance on par with shingles and measles vaccines. It is also consistent with last week’s peek at how it did in an analysis of the first 94 subjects to fall sick.  "

In Indianapolis, the trigger is 13%. As the coronavirus pandemic surges, cities and school districts—even those located near each other—are making closure decisions based on differing criteria. Nationwide, the triggers for shutting classrooms vary widely, as do the sets of authorities who make the calls. Complicating the decision: The understanding of the virus has been changing since schools across the country closed in the spring and sent more than 50 million students to remote learning. Since then, some studies show that schools aren’t major contributors to community spread. Some researchers say decisions to close often depend on a community’s density, transportation patterns, resources for safety steps, political atmosphere and local risk tolerance, as well as trends in the pandemic. New York City, the nation’s largest school district and one that had stood out this fall for committing to bringing students back to classrooms, said Wednesday that it will temporarily go remote-only, because 3% of the city’s virus tests were positive over a seven-day average, a trigger Mayor Bill de Blasio set this summer in a deal with the teachers union. To families who called on the city to continue in-person learning, the mayor said a rigorous safety standard is needed to instill confidence in parents and staff. A number of other districts have announced closures in recent weeks after thresholds were surpassed, including Pittsburgh Public Schools and Connecticut’s Bridgeport Public Schools. As of Tuesday, a dozen of the country’s largest school districts have reverted or plan to return to virtual learning after reopening in-person this fall, up from six districts last week, according to information compiled by the Council of the Great City Schools.

The growth in the number of daily job postings in Midwestern states, where the virus is raging, is slowing sharply compared with October, according to data from the job site ZipRecruiter. But other states with among the lowest virus infection rates in the nation, including California, New York and North Carolina, are also seeing a slowdown. The regional data suggest it is not the level of Covid-19 infections but how state officials, businesses and consumers respond to the pandemic that appears to have the greater impact on the pace of the labor market’s recovery in a state. “The relationship between Covid cases and labor-market outcomes is complicated by the fact that it’s mediated by people’s individual decisions…and policy makers’ decisions,” said Julia Pollak, labor economist at ZipRecruiter. Political views regarding the virus are key to driving decision making among consumers and policy makers. Republicans are much less likely to be worried about the virus than Democrats, according to polling by Gallup. That suggests consumers are more likely to venture out in Republican-leaning states despite virus risks. Republican governors, too, have been less likely than Democrats to impose restrictions on businesses and individuals, such as requiring social distancing or mask wearing.  "

The pandemic requires a temporary suspension of the world’s usual intellectual property system, the countries say they will argue at a WTO council meeting this Friday. If poorer countries aren’t given special access to the vaccines, which are expected to hit the market by the start of next year, the group of developing nations say they will argue, they will continue to be devastated by the coronavirus even as it is stopped in the West. The proposed waiver pits the developing nations against the U.S., the European Union, Japan and other wealthier countries, as well as Western pharmaceutical companies, which say respecting intellectual property rights is key to promoting the rapid development of the vaccines. Developed nations have already struck deals with Western pharmaceutical companies to buy up enough vaccines to tie up most of the world’s production capacity until the end of 2021. If the developed nations don’t relent, South Africa is prepared to try to force the issue through a rare contested vote at the trade organization, said Mustaqeem De Gama, counselor at the South African mission to the WTO.

To adapt to the pandemic and the job loss it unleashed, more Americans are becoming their own bosses, setting up tiny businesses to work as traveling hair stylists, in-home personal trainers, boutique mask designers and chefs. A man in Maryland started a mobile car-washing business. Many new entrepreneurs previously worked at salons, gyms and restaurants, in the kind of face-to-face jobs erased when state orders closed swaths of the economy in the spring. The economy has since mounted a split recovery, with some Americans thriving while many others continue to struggle. A cohort of the laid-off, stuck on the descending arm of that recovery, are using their ingenuity to get off it. “As horrible as [the pandemic] is, and as badly as it has affected so many people, it has pushed people to come up with new ideas and products and services,” said Steven Hamilton, an economist at George Washington University. When the high-end New Jersey gym that employed Damien Johnson as a personal trainer closed in March, he considered applying for work at an Amazon.com warehouse. But a couple of clients Mr. Johnson already worked with outside of the gym stuck with him, doing their workouts in basements, parks   and backyards. Gradually, Mr. Johnson picked up new clients for one-on-one sessions, through a combination of personal referrals and posts on his Instagram page."

But even the most stringent lockdown was essentially a fiction for essential workers and the working poor, who had to perform their jobs despite the uncertainty and risk. For those confined to their homes and those who had no choice but to leave them, the mental and physical toll has been immense. It is past time to deploy a strategy that protects the vulnerable while interrupting airborne viral transmission in places where people come together. A balanced and layered approach can help open clinics, schools, businesses, houses of worship and society in general. Many are surprised to learn that there are low-cost and effective approaches already in widespread use outside the U.S. that can provide focused protection for the vulnerable and prevent transmission of viruses in indoor settings. The installation of a simple technology that deactivates germs could make public spaces safer against viruses and bacteria for decades. Also, while new vaccines are making the headlines, a nearly century-old vaccine that costs pennies per dose and is already used by hundreds of millions of people world-wide can help reduce severe outcomes from respiratory infections. The former tool is upper-room UVC germicidal lighting. These fixtures look like glorified bug-zappers, but the bugs they zap are viruses and bacteria, not insects. The technology has been around since 1937, when it was first used against a measles outbreak—an airborne virus more contagious than Covid-19—in a Philadelphia school. Studies show that when optimally used in concert with good ventilation systems, UVC germicidal lighting provides the same effect as completely replacing the air in a room more than 10 times an hour. This reduces transmission and is a safe, effective layer of protection against threatening airborne diseases in crowded indoor settings. The devices are manufactured in America and have been supplied to U.S.-funded programs around the world through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Agency for International Development. Outfitting indoor public spaces with these devices would cost considerably less than the trillions already spent by the federal government to mitigate the economic impact of this crisis. Our data from implementation of this approach in Oklahoma City indicate that installing these bug zappers in a typical building costs less than $6 a square foot. Maintenance and upkeep are cheap and simple. From Utica College in New York to the Salvation Army of Central Oklahoma, and from Los Angeles International Airport to the Cambridge Friends School in Massachusetts, these lights are already on and providing a layer of important protection. The second tool is a vaccine that hundreds of millions of people have taken for years with almost no side effects—the antituberculosis vaccine BCG.

The questions include everything from reopening the office lunchroom to policing employees’ personal lives. Delta Systems Inc., a maker of components for outdoor power equipment, thought it had all the proper safety measures in place. The Streetsboro, Ohio, company gives workers the option of cloth masks or plastic face shields. It checks employees’ temperatures daily and asks a handful of questions—about out-of-state travel, exposure to someone diagnosed with the virus and changes in their own health. But after cases jumped again in Ohio and two of Delta’s roughly 200 employees tested positive for the virus in recent weeks, executives have begun looking at next steps. “We have to winterize our Covid plan,” Chief Executive Elizabeth Barry said. Delta is now weighing whether and how to ask employees if they have associated with people outside their bubble when they aren’t at work. As a manufacturer, the company doesn’t have the luxury of shutting down or sending production workers to do their jobs from home, Ms. Barry said. “It is probably none of my business what people do outside of Delta,” she added. “The other side of it that I have to make them think every morning: Is there something they have done that might jeopardize the workforce?” Until recently, the biggest Covid-19-related question was whether to bring back microwave ovens pulled from the lunchroom and access to lockers.

They’re a tribute to private U.S. corporate innovation, but now developing countries led by India and South Africa are making a damaging bid to waive patent protections for these life-saving advances. The attempt will surface Friday when these countries offer a resolution at the World Trade Organization meeting to waive patent protections for Covid vaccines, therapies and other technologies. They say this is needed to ensure poor countries have equal access, but their effort would harm everyone, including the poor. “There are several reports about intellectual property rights hindering or potentially hindering timely provisioning of affordable medical products,” India and South Africa wrote last month in a WTO proposal that has drawn support from Pakistan, Argentina and Venezuela. America’s left and many nonprofit activists are backing the resolution. Their complaint is that wealthy countries have locked up most of the world’s vaccine supply next year and are hoarding virus therapies and diagnostic tests. They want the WTO to grant free and unrestricted access to the intellectual property of private companies. Otherwise, they warn, the global pandemic will continue to rage. This is a false choice. Private companies in the U.S. and to a lesser extent in Europe, with the financial support of their governments, have produced most virus breakthroughs. The Trump Administration’s Operation Warp Speed has spent more than $10 billion to advance vaccine clinical trials, manufacturing and distribution.  "

That level is more than three times higher than the roughly 210,000 typically filed each week in the first two months of 2020, though it is down sharply from a peak of nearly seven million in late March. At present levels, initial jobless claims are still higher than they were in any other recession on record. “Momentum in the economy, all else equal, should continue, but the virus might cause a rise for a few weeks,” said Michelle Meyer, head of U.S. economics at BofA Global Research. Employers have continued to expand head counts in recent weeks. The number of people collecting unemployment benefits through regular state programs, which cover most workers, fell to 6.4 million for the week ended Nov. 7 from 6.8 million a week earlier, on a seasonally adjusted basis, according to the Labor Department. Continuing claims declined throughout the summer and into the fall, as many laid-off workers found jobs or exhausted their state benefits. The number of people collecting these benefits has now fallen below levels reached in 2009, during the last recession.  "

The federal government, which has some of the most sophisticated antihacking technologies in the world, is offering limited assistance to Mr. Biden’s transition operation in securing its email and other communications, despite concerns that the team is likely a top espionage target for Russia, China, and other adversaries, according to people familiar with the transition. The lack of government cybersecurity support is among the obstacles the Biden transition team has faced as a result of the Trump administration’s refusal to acknowledge Mr. Biden’s election victory and make available the resources of the federal government ahead of his inauguration in two months. Normally, the General Services Administration would own and manage the setup of government email accounts for a presidential transition team, which are typically assigned the “ptt.gov” domain. The cybersecurity wing of the Department of Homeland Security typically assists in helping a transition to protect those newly created government email accounts, according to current and former officials, and could rely on information from U.S. intelligence agencies to inform its protective efforts. The Trump administration is blocking many of the transition-related resources usually provided to a president-elect, including government email accounts. The GSA so far has declined to identify Mr. Biden as the winner of the election, citing ongoing litigation, even though Mr. Trump has no clear path to victory, according to legal experts.  "

The Journal only analyzed the big borrowers from the program, which accounted for about half of the overall loans though only about 13.5% of the total participants.

The SBA has only released data on the largest borrowers, which the Journal linked to bankruptcy filings. The total amount lent to companies that went bankrupt is between $228 million and $509 million—the government publishes a range for the loan amounts.

With this month’s announcements of two highly effective Covid-19 vaccines, enough Americans should be inoculated over next spring and summer for normal life to begin to resume. It won’t be quite the same as before, though: Our behavior will have changed, with profound effects on the economy. Any of these changes on their own could well have redirected tens or hundreds of billions of dollars in government and consumer spending from one place to another, but they are all happening at the same time. Some of the trillions of dollars’ worth of aircraft, cruise ships, gyms, shopping malls, office buildings, hotels and convention halls have been sitting idle may not be needed even after it is safe to use them. Others like e-commerce infrastructure can’t be built fast enough. First we have to get through the next several months. With new cases rising again throughout the country, more people’s livelihoods will be damaged and more businesses will be driven to the brink. The losses have been most acute among service-sector businesses — especially smaller ones. Many have failed and the danger is that, with financial resources running thin during this latest Covid upsurge, more will follow in the months ahead. As a result, some of the millions of people who were put out of work by the crisis won’t have jobs to come back to when it ends. The longer they remain out of work, the more their skills erode and the harder it is for them to find work again. That, in turn, can lower the pace at which the economy is able to grow. Those who work in some of the hardest-hit industries, such as restaurants and hotels, could have the hardest time overcoming the setbacks suffered from the crisis. The gaps between rich and poor could widen as a result.  "

Nursing homes reported more than 1,900 resident deaths from Covid-19 in the last week of October, as well as more than 32,000 confirmed and suspected cases among staff and residents, according to newly released federal data analyzed by The Wall Street Journal. Those nationwide totals at the facilities were the highest since early August, when states including Texas and Florida were seeing increases. This time, the virus is infiltrating a far-flung range of facilities, with a growing share of the deaths occurring in rural and small-town communities in states such as Wisconsin, North Dakota and Montana, where case counts have climbed rapidly. The pattern tracks how the virus is spreading more broadly throughout the U.S., hitting regions that had been largely spared earlier in the pandemic. “Nursing homes are not isolated from what happens in the community,” said            Carrie Henning-Smith,      an associate professor at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health. “We’re seeing this run rampant through rural communities.”  Facilities in rural counties reported 18% of nursing-home Covid-19 deaths in the week ending Nov. 1, though they housed only 10% of the overall population, according to the Journal’s analysis of weekly survey data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Small-town counties saw 17% of the nursing-home deaths, though facilities there have only 12% of the total residents. At Lutheran Sunset Home, a 91-bed facility in Grafton, N.D., 55 residents and 46 staffers have been infected since an outbreak started in late October, after Covid-19 infections hit a high rate in the surrounding county. Five residents infected with the coronavirus have died. Staffers following recommended precautions, but “it still spread like wildfire,” said            Trevor Tompkins,      the administrator of the nonprofit facility. “To put it bluntly, we’re in hell.” The trend is a turnaround from the spring, when nursing homes in large cities such as New York were seeing major outbreaks. Facilities in the most urban counties represented around one-third of nursing-home deaths in late May and early June, and only 9% in the most recent week of the data. Rural nursing homes were tied to only 4% of the deaths in late May, compared with their recent share of 18%. Overall, U.S. long-term-care facilities have been tied to more than 90,000 Covid-19 deaths since the start of the pandemic, according to a Wall Street Journal tally of recent state, local and federal data. Over time, long-term care deaths have tended to represent around 40% of all Covid-19 deaths. Northern Montana Care Center, in Havre, didn’t have a single case of Covid-19 through the spring and summer, even as the virus devastated facilities on both coasts. But after Covid-19 began spreading in the region, the nursing home saw its first positive test in late September. Eventually, the outbreak spread to 35 of the facility’s 68 residents, killing 16. “It came into our community and it came strong, and it just found its way into our facility,” said            Christen Obresley,      the nursing home’s administrator. She said the infection likely arrived through an asymptomatic staff member, though the facility had followed state and federal guidelines on testing and infection control.

Sources: WSJ analysis of data released by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (rates, cases, deaths);  National Center for Health Statistics (urban/rural classifications) The resurgence in nursing-home cases and deaths comes despite new federal requirements that facilities in counties with high Covid-19 rates test staff as often as twice a week, in an effort to detect and stem outbreaks quickly. Many nursing homes have declined to use federally provided rapid-testing equipment, citing concerns including accuracy, yet face delays in getting results from labs. Some facilities have continued to report shortages of protective gear such as N95 masks, a major problem earlier in the pandemic. Staffing for many nursing homes outside large metropolitan areas has long been a particular problem, according to researchers and nursing-home administrators. The pandemic has created a crisis for some facilities that can’t find temporary workers to fill in when employees must stay home to quarantine. “The more isolated the community, the harder it is to bring in workforce,” said            Shawnda Schroeder,      a research associate professor focused on rural health at the University of North Dakota. Other challenges rural nursing homes face, researchers said, can include smaller buildings that make it hard to isolate infected residents. Rural nursing homes sometimes lack easy access to a hospital or doctor, after closures of many rural hospitals in recent years. A CMS spokeswoman said the agency has “taken an unprecedented number of public health actions to support nursing homes on Covid-19,” including regulatory moves to ease staffing crunches and allow more use of telehealth, which can help rural facilities that aren’t close to physicians or hospitals. Guardian Angels Health & Rehabilitation Center in Hibbing, Minn., drew on employees from other facilities owned by the same nonprofit. It put nursing administrators to work in front-line positions and brought in some temporary agency workers, who had to be put up in hotels. Still, in an outbreak that affected 39 residents and 30 employees in September and October, the facility needed help from five National Guard members, who filled in for nine days in early October. Ten residents died. “Staffing was tight in the first place,” said            Scot Allen,      a vice president at St. Francis Health Services of Morris, which owns the Hibbing facility. “Then you add in the impact of Covid…It’s very precarious.” Some rural facilities have been overwhelmed. After an outbreak beginning in early October that sickened all 61 residents, Andbe Home, in Norton, Kan., received an Oct. 26 letter from CMS threatening it with removal from the Medicare program. State and federal regulators found the nursing home’s response to the outbreak, which has led to 20 deaths through Nov. 10, had placed residents in “immediate jeopardy.” An outside company, Mission Health Communities LLC, is now temporarily overseeing the facility.            Cheri Kauset,      a Mission Health vice president, said the company is working to help Andbe get back into compliance with regulatory requirements. “We have seen good progress,” she said.

But it has promised the world the most doses—more than three billion. The company has assembled an unprecedented network of manufacturing and distribution partners spanning the globe, complementing a series of deals with governments that have sought to lock in vaccine supplies for their countries. The British drugmaker this week said the results from late-stage clinical trials in the U.K. and Brazil found its vaccine was as much as 90% effective in preventing infections. Depending on the dosage, the shot’s efficacy ranged from 62% to 90%, with the higher number applying to a limited subset of trial volunteers. Still, even at an average efficacy of 70%, researchers called the results a promising sign that the two-dose shot can help stem the pandemic. AstraZeneca executives say they plan to supply every region of the world by 2022 without profiting directly from the vaccine during the pandemic. Working in partnership with the University of Oxford, the company is pricing the vaccine at $3 to $5 a dose. That is a fraction of the price of each of the two leading vaccines, which have shown to be more than 90% effective in late-stage trials: one from  Pfizer Inc.  and Germany’s  BioNTech SE ,  and the other from  Moderna Inc.  Their initial supply agreements are with wealthier countries."

Outbreaks have also hit other kinds of senior homes like assisted-living facilities, and the deaths stemming from long-term care outbreaks comprise nearly 40% of the more than 260,000 overall Covid-19 deaths recorded by Johns Hopkins University. The pace of deaths in this vulnerable population is on the rise, according to federal data tracking nursing homes, the hardest-hit kind of senior facility. These outbreaks mirror the growth in cases and rising tide of deaths nationwide. “Sadly, nothing has changed,” said Tamara Konetzka, a professor of health-services research at the University of Chicago. The Journal’s tally of state, federal and local data also includes more than 670,000 probable and confirmed Covid-19 cases in long-term care, affecting both residents and staff members. The real death toll and case counts are likely higher due to delays in some states’ reporting and gaps in the numbers. For example, New York state doesn’t specify counts for nursing-home cases or Covid-19-linked deaths among nursing residents who died outside the facility, which often occurs when the sick are sent to hospitals.

But with the timeline for recovery still uncertain, the best offense may still be a good defense. One place to look is in and around e-commerce—a sector that is likely to continue its red-hot run during the holiday shopping season and beyond.  Shopify ,  for example, is up over 150% this year. And while its shares fell more than 13% the day  Pfizer  reported efficacy results, they have since recovered nearly all of those losses as investors digest both the long winter ahead of the Covid-19 vaccine as well as the fact that online shopping is likely to continue to grow in earnest, pandemic or not. But while Shopify is certainly well loved at this point—its market capitalization now tops $126 billion—lesser-known opportunities are popping up for those investors paying close attention. One such play is  IAC/InterActiveCorp . ’s Vimeo, a video hosting and sharing platform used by a growing number of Shopify’s customers, among many others, to easily and effectively help tell their story and increase conversion online. IAC said Vimeo raised $150 million in early November in an oversubscribed equity offering from outside investors that valued its software-as-a-service company at $2.75 billion. That implies big potential for a company that is currently operating at a $300 million annual revenue run rate implied by its third-quarter results. For investors looking to turn movies into money, opportunity may soon knock. IAC said earlier this month it is considering a full spinoff of Vimeo, which would make it the 11th public company to come from IAC’s golden breeding grounds. Fostered by the very hands that helped turn public companies such as Expedia Group and Match Group into behemoths in their own right, Vimeo’s business was already accelerating before the pandemic. Its organic bookings growth consistently accelerated last year from 11% in the first quarter to 27% by the fourth quarter of 2019 according to IAC.  "

Since the pandemic began, doctors have puzzled over why the coronavirus causes as many as 80% of patients to experience anosmia, a temporary loss of smell. Most patients recover their sense of smell within a week or two. But a smaller subset, probably 10% to 20% of those who experience sensory disruption, lose their sense of smell for much longer, and when it returns, they find their favorite foods, familiar scents and even their own body odors have changed, doctors and researchers say. French fries might smell like putrid, rotting meat. Coffee sometimes evokes burning rubber tires. And chocolate can take on a sickly sweet, chemical odor. This condition, known as parosmia, is the result of mixed-up signals between olfactory sensory neurons, the nerve cells located in the nasal cavity that detect scents, and the part of the brain where odors are decoded and interpreted.

The coronavirus has continued to spread widely in detention facilities, despite officials taking a host of measures to stem it. Prisons have released thousands of inmates to ease overcrowding, stepped up health screenings among visitors and adopted protocols from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention such as mask wearing for inmates and staff. The number of infections inside the nation’s state and federal prison systems has varied over the past six months, largely mirroring the nationwide spread. Between April and June, prisons recorded an average of 17,700 new cases a month. That climbed to more than 30,000 new infections a month in July and August, before dipping slightly in September to 25,031, and 26,290 in October, according to the Covid Prison Project, a group made up of interdisciplinary public health scientists from universities around the country tracking the virus’s spread in correctional facilities. Through mid-November, the U.S. prison system has already recorded more than 20,000 cases, putting it on track for the highest number of monthly cases since the pandemic began.

The Italians and Spaniards who ventured out onto their balconies last March to sing and play instruments have at least part of the answer. Emerging evidence shows that the more the world gets us down, the better music feels. So says a new study involving 1,000 participants from the U.S., Europe and Latin America. Carried out by Pablo Ripollés and Michael McPhee of New York University in collaboration with Robert Zatorre, a professor of neuroscience at McGill University, the study looked at what people considered their most effective coping mechanisms during the shelter-in-place orders at the beginning of the pandemic last spring. The researchers began by assessing how profoundly the pandemic affected each participant. Did that person get very sick? Did they lose a spouse, a parent, a friend or a job? How anxious did they feel? The researchers then looked at which activities worked best to lift people’s moods. Sex and drugs were among the 43 options participants could choose from, along with exercise, cooking, social media, video calls and various types of entertainment. The participants, who were fairly representative of their countries in terms of gender, age, ethnicity and social status, also completed standardized personality tests, as well a questionnaire designed to assess their sensitivity to rewards. “The sensitivity to reward questionnaire assesses how much enjoyment you get out of certain activities. It could be eating, sex, staying in the shower or smelling the flowers,” said Prof. Zatorre. In addition, the participants completed a survey assessing their emotional expressivity, or how readily they reveal their feelings.  "

Its plants supply some of the world’s biggest consumer brands, supermarket chains and restaurants. The coronavirus pandemic upended those finely tuned supply chains. Since the spring, when meatpacking workers across North America fell sick by the thousands, Cargill and other food processors have revamped plants to defend against the virus that causes Covid-19. The Minnesota-based company installed partitions between processing-line work stations, started checking workers’ temperatures, issued masks and spaced out seating in break rooms. As infection rates rise around the country, Cargill is urging employees to follow similar practices at home.

Some economists are starting to embrace the idea that a prospective Covid-19 vaccine could allow people to once again spend money on travel, restaurants and other services—and drive up prices in the U.S. That would be a change from the past 10 years, when inflation rarely hit the Federal Reserve’s 2% target despite a strong economy and low unemployment. It would also test the central bank’s new framework, which calls for periods of inflation above that level after stretches, like the current one, when it has run below. The economy’s progress since the sharp, pandemic-induced recession in the spring has made forecasters more confident of a strong recovery once a vaccine enables people to resume their pre-pandemic lives. Airlines and hotels, which laid off thousands of workers and slashed prices at the start of the pandemic, could struggle to meet the surge in demand, sending prices higher. And city rents, which dropped as people hunkered down, could start creeping up again as they look at alternatives.  "

U.S. government scientists now estimate that 40% of cases are asymptomatic and 80% of symptomatic cases are mild—in short, 88% of subjects don’t know they are infected or have no great incentive to find out if they are suffering from Covid or some more familiar bug. An American adult typically suffers two colds a year, while school-age children may suffer 10 or more, and 20 million of us get the flu. A conservative estimate, then, is that 13 million Americans every day suffer from something not readily distinguishable from mild Covid (never mind asymptomatic Covid). This perhaps explains why, despite conducting 186 million tests since the plague arrived, we’ve found only 12.7 million cases. Most who have Covid aren’t getting tested; among those seeking tests the large majority are suffering from something that isn’t Covid. The implications have been slow to sink in. Embarrassing as America’s early testing fumbles were, the consequences were likely small. The odds were heavily against us being able to detect multiple outbreaks, seeded here and there by travelers from overseas, amid millions of colds and flus.

In the wake of a global pandemic that has killed more than 250,000 Americans, there is growing support among President-elect Joe Biden’s advisers for broadening the definition of national security within spy and defense agencies and upgrading their ability to detect, analyze and respond to pandemics. “We are looking at whether our intelligence resources are appropriately focused on something that’s very important,” said a senior foreign-policy adviser to Mr. Biden. Congress, which is likely to hold hearings next year on the U.S. response to the pandemic, is also taking a closer look at the intelligence agencies’ role. A House Intelligence Committee report in September found that U.S. spy agencies pay insufficient attention to so-called soft national-security threats, such as infectious diseases and climate change. It recommended a review of the $85 billion intelligence budget and said the Central Intelligence Agency and other spy agencies should increase support to U.S. public-health agencies.  "

Crowds were smaller this year than last after chains like  Walmart Inc.  and  Best Buy Co.

Even Black Friday veterans out shopping said they had made much more of their purchases online this year.

Nevertheless, Mr. Paye said he was mostly done with his holiday shopping, having made many purchases on Amazon using his Prime subscription. “Whenever I need something, I just go to Amazon and buy it,” Mr. Paye said. “Or sometimes  eBay .  Whichever is cheaper.” Just a handful of shops at the Queens Center Mall, including beauty retailer Sephora and jeweler Pandora, had short lines as people waited patiently to be let inside at limited numbers to observe social distancing. The mall was filled with shoppers last year. “Retailers aggressively promoted online to manage the crowds, so we didn’t have the frenzy of long lines,” said Stephen Lebovitz, chief executive of mall owner  CBL & Associates Properties Inc.,  which filed for bankruptcy protection earlier this month and owns about 90 shopping centers in the Southeast and Midwest."

The number of layoffs is about 4,000 more employees than the 28,000 job cuts announced in September. Most of the job losses will come in the company’s theme-park ranks, where thousands of workers have already been furloughed or laid off. The severe cuts to Disney’s theme-park division accentuates a new reality at the company since the pandemic canceled most live entertainment. Once a reliable moneymaker, the Disney theme parks are now either operating at reduced capacity or closed altogether, with one location—Disneyland in Anaheim, Calif.—not expected to reopen until at least next year. That has forced Disney executives to reorganize the company and shift focus toward its year-old streaming service, Disney+. The service’s success in finding early subscribers has saved Disney’s share price, which is trading at pre-pandemic levels as investors warm to its growth potential. Even with several vaccines in development and possibly available next year, Disney is betting that its growth for the foreseeable future will come in the living room, not at the theme-park turnstile. The company has allocated more resources to its streaming operations and even shipped some theatrical releases like “Hamilton” and “Mulan” to the platform. Another service, Star, will expand further overseas. A recent company reorganization put streaming at the center of distribution strategy.  "

Then tourists flew home from vacations with the pathogen, seeding fresh outbreaks. As Americans enter a period of peak travel among their states starting with Thanksgiving, new discoveries about how Europe’s second coronavirus wave spread provide an object lesson. Many European regions had made such gains against Covid-19 as to be cited as models. Those gains proved fragile: Unanticipated pockets of infection on the continent and a rush to relax rules allowed it to surge across Europe again. Much of Europe’s new wave can now be traced to outbreaks among agricultural workers living in cramped conditions in Spain’s Catalonia and Aragón regions, according to researchers from Switzerland and Spain. It spread to nearby cities and across Spain, then home with tourists. “Initially the variant was exported from Spain,” said Iñaki Comas, a researcher at the Spanish National Research Council, a government institution, “but later it moved multiple times from one country to another.” Dr. Comas is co-author of a study, being peer-reviewed, on a genetic mutation in the virus, known as 20A.EU1. The variant was first detected in June and July, only weeks after Europe ended its first round of lockdowns. By late October, it was in high a proportion of virus samples around Europe whose genome sequences have been analyzed: almost 80% in Spain, 90% in the U.K., 60% in Ireland, 30% to 40% in Switzerland and the Netherlands, and significant percentages in France, Italy and elsewhere."

America’s housing market has been radically changed by the Covid-19 crisis, and some of those changes will persist. But the first thing to come after the crisis passes will be the hangover. Usually housing gets hammered in recessions, but during this downturn it has flourished. Desperate for outdoor space, many families decamped from cities for the suburbs’ greener pastures. The ability to work remotely led to a surge in demand for second homes in vacation areas such as Cape Cod and Aspen. And historically low interest rates fueled the buying. That has led to a surge in demand, and prices, particularly in towns, suburbs and exurbs near major cities. Redfin, an online real estate platform, reports that median home prices were up 14.2% nationwide in October compared with a year ago. In Bridgeport, Conn., an area within commuting distance of New York City, median prices were 39.4% higher. But just as the housing market has roared amid the coronavirus pandemic, it could cool with its passing—at least temporarily.  "

People over 60 make up more than nine in 10 fatalities linked to Covid-19 since the start of August, figures show, with more men than women succumbing to it. The virus has now claimed more than 1.3 million lives world-wide. The pattern, similar to that observed in Europe’s first wave of the pandemic as well as in the U.S., highlights the danger the virus continues to pose to older age groups and the difficulty of shielding the most vulnerable if the pandemic spreads more broadly, researchers say. European countries eased restrictions on daily life and their economies in the summer, only to reimpose them in recent weeks. Caseloads and deaths increased as the virus spread to elderly citizens from younger age groups. The policy conclusion: If the virus gets out of control in the community, there isn’t a practical way to prevent older people from catching it."

Enrollment by first-year students plummeted 18.9%, indicating that some people who weren’t yet on the path to a degree are sidestepping it entirely right now. Those drops are far worse than what has been reported by four-year public and private nonprofit colleges, which saw small, single-digit declines overall. “In hindsight, knowing what we know about the pandemic and who was most affected, it perhaps should not have been a surprise,” said Thomas Brock, director of the Community College Research Center at Teachers College, Columbia University. Community colleges overwhelmingly serve students of color, those from low-income backgrounds and those who would be the first in their families to attend college.

Pfizer still expects to roll out more than a billion doses in 2021 as originally planned. Pfizer and Germany-based partner            BioNTech SE      had hoped to roll out 100 million vaccines world-wide by the end of this year, a plan that was reduced to 50 million on Nov. 9. The U.K. on Wednesday granted emergency-use authorization for the vaccine, becoming the first Western country to start administering doses. The two-shot vaccine also is being reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration in the U.S., where a similar authorization could come later this month and a rollout before the end of the year. The U.S. regulator also is considering a vaccine developed by Cambridge, Mass.-based            Moderna Inc.      that could begin shipping before Christmas. The doses are among an array of vaccines that have been developed this year as the coronavirus pandemic has raged across much of the world. Authorities estimate nearly 1.5 million people world-wide have died from the virus, including 273,836 in the U.S. as of Dec. 2. Pfizer had its 100-million dose goal in place until mid-November, when it became clear the supply-chain hurdles were too great for the end-of-the-year timeline. Pfizer on Nov. 9, in announcing the vaccine candidate the company and BioNTech had developed had proven more than 90% effective in preventing Covid-19 in trial participants, said it expects “to produce globally up to 50 million vaccine doses in 2020 and up to 1.3 billion doses in 2021.” That was a step back from its earlier projections for output by the end of the year. “We were late,” said a person directly involved in the development of the Pfizer vaccine. “Some early batches of the raw materials failed to meet the standards. We fixed it, but ran out of time to meet this year’s projected shipments.” Pfizer sources its raw materials from providers in the U.S. and Europe. Scaling up production of these components proved challenging last month as the company awaited the results of its trials, which came in to be 95% effective and well-tolerated in a 44,000-subject trial. Pfizer wouldn’t say where shortfalls over ingredients arose as it ramped up production. Vaccines typically contain materials from suppliers that can include antivirus agents, antiseptic liquids, sterile water and elements of the DNA of the virus itself that won’t cause serious symptoms but trigger the immune system to make antibodies. In a typical vaccination campaign, pharmaceutical companies would wait until their product is approved before buying raw materials, establishing manufacturing lines and setting up supply chains to ship a vaccine. Pfizer has never manufactured a vaccine with technology that uses mRNA, the molecular couriers that carry genetic instructions to cells in the human body, so it has had to scale up production capacity even as research was still under way. “For this one, everything happened simultaneously,” the person familiar with the Pfizer development said. “We started setting up the supply chain in March, while the vaccine was still being developed. That’s totally unprecedented.” Pfizer and BioNtech are still on track to roll out 1.3 billion vaccines in 2021, and the 50 million dose shortfall this year will be covered in 2021 as production ramps up. The company is setting up what it has described as its biggest ever vaccination campaign through two final assembly and distribution centers in Kalamazoo, Mich., and Puurs, Belgium, which will handle the European supply. The U.K. authorization marks a milestone in the effort to develop a promising new vaccine technology into a widely available shot in record time. The U.K. ordered 40 million Pfizer doses, enough to vaccinate 20 million people. The government said in November that it could get up to 10 million doses this year, but the expectation is that four to five million vaccines will be shipped.  U.K. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the shots will be rolled out as quickly as they can be made at Pfizer’s Belgium plant. Some 800,000 are due in the coming days and “several millions” throughout December, he said. The U.S. government has placed an initial order for 100 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine, with the option to purchase 500 million additional doses. The EU ordered 200 million doses with an option for another 100 million. Japan ordered 120 million doses, and countries in South America and in the Asia-Pacific region also have placed significant orders. Corrections & Amplifications			Pfizer announced on Nov. 9 that it would scale back its target for the number of vaccines produced this year. An earlier version of this article, headline and summary didn’t make clear that the lower target was announced previously.

The symptoms were harsh enough to land him in hospital for two weeks. “Back then we knew very little about the virus,” he wrote in an email. By the time Gaviria was healthy enough to leave Abu Dhabi, his world was a more uncertain place. The sports calendar had been scrubbed. Entire countries were shutting down.

Canadian officials are betting the aggressive approach will pay off, pointing to the number of jobs already recovered, and argue that the country can afford to pour money into the economy while borrowing costs are historically low. But some economists warn the heavy spending could lead to a fiscal crisis, and one major ratings firm has already stripped the country of its triple-A rating. Canada isn’t alone in its spending spree: The International Monetary Fund estimates governments around the world have doled out $12 trillion to minimize the economic damage from restrictions in place to halt transmission of Covid-19. Canada’s virus-related spending, the bulk of which originates with the federal government, has totaled about 382 billion Canadian dollars, the equivalent of $294 billion, and accounts for roughly 19% of Canada’s total economic output. Yet data from the IMF indicate Canada’s fiscal position during the pandemic—incorporating all levels of government—has deteriorated at the fastest pace among the major economies in the Group of 20 industrialized countries as it seeks to keep the economy pumping. “Canada could come off as heroic if this spending is done right,” said Jimmy Jean, a strategist at Desjardins Securities in Montreal. “If Canada fails, all the emergency spending might have been done in vain because we won’t have the capacity to power the post-vaccine recovery.”  "

The result is a fragmentary global vaccination drive likely to proceed at vastly different speeds. For most people around the world, a vaccine will remain a distant hope for several months, and it could be years before the poorest countries cover their people. Consequently, governments may need to deploy alternatives like widespread testing and smarter social distancing restrictions in order to contain the virus’s spread, global public health experts said. “When we talk about the global vaccine race, there are still a lot more questions than answers,” said Syra Madad, a senior director at New York City’s Health and Hospitals Corporation. “I don’t think it’s going to be enough to get us out of the pandemic.… If the question is, is a vaccine an exit strategy? It’s part of an exit strategy.” Europe and America have struck dozens of different, competing bilateral contracts with drug makers, but initial supplies will be limited, forcing hard choices through at least the first quarter of next year. This week, the U.K.’s authorization of the West’s first vaccine offered hope that other leading Western candidates could soon cross the finish line. But the front-running candidates use novel viral RNA technology that is hard to scale up. Whether and how soon the U.S. and EU can inoculate the majority of their populations will partly depend on whether other vaccines—which use more traditional platforms—prove safe and effective.  "

She, like many other health-care workers, faces yet another challenge in keeping up with the recent surge in coronavirus cases: A number of people in her community say the virus isn’t as bad as public-health and news reports indicate—and some say it isn’t real. Outside the hospital—at the grocery-store checkout line after work, or through family friends—Dr. Schulte says she hears people calling the virus a hoax and saying medical professionals are exaggerating the severity. The disbelief, on top of the relentless physical and mental demands of their jobs during the pandemic, is draining many hands-on medical workers and making it even harder for them to provide care, they say. “We see what is happening—and then to reconcile that with some of the disbelief that you run into is very hard,” Dr. Schulte said. “It’s a parallel universe.” Covid denial, as some health-care workers call it, can take forms ranging from a belief that Covid-19 is no more serious than a routine cold, or a belief that face masks aren’t effective at slowing the spread, to the idea that the pandemic is an elaborate hoax.

Travel budgets have been slashed and some meetings will remain virtual; conferences and conventions may be crimped. But by how much? It matters not only to airlines and their employees but also their customers—travelers. That’s because higher fares paid by corporate customers actually subsidize cheap fares for vacationers. What’s more, less business travel means that airlines schedule fewer flights on business routes, like trips to New York, Chicago, London and Tokyo. That means fewer seats for leisure travelers. Estimates of permanent change in the airline industry have ranged from the CEOs of American, United and Delta all saying business travel will come roaring back in full, though it may take a few years, to observers like Bill Gates who recently suggested half of all business travel will never return. Guesses aside, a look at data suggests between 19% and 36% of all air trips are likely to be lost, based on a business-travel analysis I worked on with three airline-industry veterans. “Brick-and-mortar retail has been devastated by ecommerce and I think this is a parallel story,’’ says Jay Sorensen, president of IdeaWorks, an airline-industry consulting firm and a member of our group.

It has taken 10 months for Germany’s  BioNTech SE  and its U.S. partner,  Pfizer Inc.,  to develop the vaccine that was granted emergency-use authorization in the U.K. on Wednesday—beating the previous Western record for a vaccine by more than three years. Yet, for BioNTech’s founders, Ugur Sahin and Özlem Türeci, the husband-and-wife team behind the successful endeavor, it was the outcome of three decades of work, starting long before the coronavirus first appeared in humans last winter. When the pandemic broke out, Dr. Sahin had spent years studying mRNA, genetic instructions that can be delivered into the body to help it defend itself against viruses and other threats. In January, days before the illness was first diagnosed in Europe, he used this knowledge to design a version of the vaccine on his home computer. “The success of Ugur and Özlem is a fantastic combination of two people who complement each other,” said Rolf Zinkernagel, a Swiss Nobel Prize laureate who once employed Dr. Sahin in his Zurich lab. “He is an innovative scientist, and she is an amazing clinician with a great sense for running a business.”  "

Andrew Cuomo said Wednesday. Mr. Cuomo said at a news conference that the initial batch of vaccines— manufactured by  Pfizer Inc.  in partnership with  BioNTech SE —will be distributed to residents of nursing homes and staff in those facilities. The companies will send the necessary second doses of the medicine roughly three weeks later to fully inoculate those recipients. A second tranche of vaccines developed by  Moderna Inc.  is expected later in December, state officials said. Both Pfizer and Moderna have asked the Food and Drug Administration to authorize use of their vaccines, and the distribution is contingent upon that approval. The initial number of doses won’t be sufficient to fully inoculate the 85,000 nursing-home residents and 130,000 facility staff in the state, officials said. However, the governor said he expects some individuals will decline to take the vaccine. Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, said he was following the advice of a federal advisory panel that on Tuesday recommended that health-care workers and residents of long-term care facilities be the first to receive vaccine doses. The governor said hospital-based health-care workers in the state would be vaccinated after people who live and work in nursing homes.  "

Between April and October the unemployment rate fell by more than half, to 6.9%, undoing more than two-thirds of its initial rise. But unemployment data overstates the health of the labor market because the supply of people either working or looking for a job has declined. The U.S. labor force is 2.2% smaller than in February, a loss of 3.7 million workers. The labor-force participation rate, or the share of Americans 16 years and over working or seeking work, was 61.7% in October, down from 63.4% in February. Though up from April’s trough, that is near its lowest since the 1970s, when far fewer women were in the workforce. The supply of workers and their productivity are the building blocks of economic growth.  A smaller labor force leaves fewer workers to build machines and clean tables, restraining the economy’s long-term prospects. “If we don’t get all the workers back, we can never have a V-shaped recovery,” said Betsey Stevenson, economics professor at the University of Michigan, referring to a quick and sustained bounce-back after a sharp decline.  “Everybody should be worried about making sure that we don’t leave workers behind,” she said."

The recent surge in Covid-19 cases across the country has led to an uptick in Americans resuming work at home after some momentum had been building for returning to the workplace, property analysts said. Floor after floor of empty office space is a source of great frustration for landlords and companies, which have invested millions of dollars in adapting building plans and developing new health protocols to make employees comfortable with a shared location. About a quarter of employees had returned to work as of Nov. 18, according to Kastle Systems, a security firm that monitors access-card swipes in more than 2,500 office buildings in 10 of the largest U.S. cities. That rate is up sharply from an April low of less than 15%, which largely consisted of building-maintenance and essential workers. The office return rate climbed steadily during the summer and early fall, but it has flattened out after reaching a high point of 27% in mid-October, Kastle said. The rate for last week was down even more sharply than in previous weeks but likely reflected the Thanksgiving Day holiday. “There’s a huge headwind against company executives to strongly push their employee bases to come back to work,” said Douglas Linde, president of big office owner  Boston Properties Inc.

Reddit hosts message boards for users on seemingly countless subjects. The company, which was founded in 2005 and is based in San Francisco, is also known for its “ask me anything” digital town halls with celebrities and politicians. It described its daily user count amid a continuing effort to attract more advertisers to its platform, which most marketers consider experimental. “We’re sharing [daily active users] for the first time as a more accurate reflection of our user growth and to be more in-line with industry reporting,” said            Jen Wong,      chief operating officer of Reddit. “We’re focused on daily usership and increasing this number as we continue to grow our community and scale our advertising business.” Reddit’s number pales compared with that of            Facebook Inc.,      which said it averaged 1.82 billion daily active users on its namesake social network in September, and is less than a third that of            Twitter Inc.,      which said it averaged 187 million monetizable daily users in the third quarter. But Reddit said growth in the ranks of its users has coincided with growth in its advertising business. The company’s ad revenue totaled more than $100 million in 2019 and is on track to rise by more than 70% this year, according to Ms. Wong. CMO Today delivers the most important news of the day for media and marketing professionals. A throttling of ad spending caused by the coronavirus pandemic hurt Reddit’s business in the second quarter—when year-over-year direct-ad revenue growth fell to 27%, from 40% in the first quarter—but it has since rebounded, growing by 83% year-over-year in the third quarter, Ms. Wong said. Direct ad revenues are based on deals conducted by Reddit’s sales team and don’t include revenues from advertising bought and sold through outside automated platforms. “Like with everybody in the ads business, it’s been a volatile year,” she said, adding that while Reddit isn’t profitable it is making significant investments. Reddit is in the experimental bucket of budgets for advertising by companies in such categories as gaming, technology, entertainment, finance and beauty, said            Susan Schiekofer,      chief digital investment officer for ad-buying giant GroupM, which is owned by ad-holding company            WPP      PLC. “If we are comparing them to the big ones—Snap, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram—they are not anywhere near that scale,” she said. “But the upside for them is really big.” GroupM has more than 10 clients currently advertising on Reddit, and that number continues to grow, Ms. Schiekofer said. Reddit’s big challenge will be in bringing more advertisers across categories to come on board and feel comfortable advertising on its platform, she added. Like Twitter and Facebook—which recently faced a boycott from some advertisers over its policies for handling hate speech and misinformation—Reddit has hosted unwelcome content posted by some of its users.  “Would I necessarily advise clients to lean right away into their top-10 fastest-growing categories?” Ms. Schiekofer said. “It’s a similar story to other platforms—their tried-and-true communities are generally safer than something that’s up-and-coming that we have not vetted yet. With these platforms, if you want to look for something that’s brand-unsafe, you can find it.” Ms. Wong said Reddit has taken efforts to ensure ads don’t appear next to content or conversations that advertising clients may deem objectionable, including by hand-selecting which communities serve ads. Reddit also offers three tiers of ad inventory—expanded, standard and limited—that advertisers can choose from to suit their comfort level, and offers clients the option to disable comments on their ads and to keep the ads away from certain keywords and communities. “More advertisers want the expanded and standard inventory than the limited inventory, despite how important brand safety is,” Ms. Wong said. Ms. Wong said Reddit’s future revenue growth will come partly by expanding the company’s ad business to new international markets. Reddit announced an operations team in London in September, and will seek to open offices in three to five countries every year, initially targeting countries in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, she added.

B-school applications for fall 2020 surged at the start of the pandemic as students sought ways to ride out a tenuous job market. Now, full-time residential M.B.A. programs continue to report higher application volumes for next fall and expect to have fewer spots to offer than in years past, since schools have allowed many international students to defer enrollment due to virus-related travel restrictions. Prospective students say they’re already feeling the crunch. Jimmy Lin applied several months ago to six of the top-ranked full-time M.B.A. programs for fall 2021. Five rejected him.

I oversee the intelligence agencies, and my office produces the President’s Daily Brief detailing the threats facing the country. If I could communicate one thing to the American people from this unique vantage point, it is that the People’s Republic of China poses the greatest threat to America today, and the greatest threat to democracy and freedom world-wide since World War II. The intelligence is clear: Beijing intends to dominate the U.S. and the rest of the planet economically, militarily and technologically. Many of China’s major public initiatives and prominent companies offer only a layer of camouflage to the activities of the Chinese Communist Party. I call its approach of economic espionage “rob, replicate and replace.” China robs U.S. companies of their intellectual property, replicates the technology, and then replaces the U.S. firms in the global marketplace. Take Sinovel. In 2018 a federal jury found the Chinese wind-turbine manufacturer guilty of stealing trade secrets from  American Superconductor .  Penalties were imposed but the damage was done. The theft resulted in the U.S. company losing more than $1 billion in shareholder value and cutting 700 jobs. Today Sinovel sells wind turbines world-wide as if it built a legitimate business through ingenuity and hard work rather than theft. The FBI frequently arrests Chinese nationals for stealing research-and-development secrets. Until the head of Harvard’s Chemistry Department was arrested earlier this year, China was allegedly paying him $50,000 a month as part of a plan to attract top scientists and reward them for stealing information. The professor has pleaded not guilty to making false statements to U.S. authorities. Three scientists were ousted in 2019 from MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston over concerns about China’s theft of cancer research. The U.S. government estimates that China’s intellectual-property theft costs America as much as $500 billion a year, or between $4,000 and $6,000 per U.S. household.  "

Bitcoin has nearly tripled in 2020 and is up more than 90% since early September. It closed Monday at $19376.18, up 6.1%. The surge comes amid a wider rally across markets. The Federal Reserve and other central banks have injected trillions worth of liquidity into the capital markets, and a number of companies working on coronavirus vaccines are providing hope that the global pandemic will soon be brought under control. With safe assets like government bonds yielding close to zero, investors have been more willing to place bets on risky assets in hopes of reaping big gains, and bitcoin is among the riskiest assets in the capital markets. “You have the weakened dollar, enormous growth of central bank balance sheets and questions about whether it will or won’t cause inflation,” said  Société Générale  forex strategist Kit Juckes. “It’s another beneficiary of the collapse in real yields.” Trading volume for bitcoin has surged in the past few months, to $50 billion a day from around $18 billion a day in September, according to data from research site Coingecko. Other cryptocurrencies have benefited from the interest as well. Ether is up 370% this year. XRP is up more than 234%.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has signed on dozens of grocery and pharmacy chains to provide Covid-19 vaccines once the inoculations are approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Among the retailers are  Kroger Co. , Albertsons Cos. and  CVS Health Corp.  These businesses are part of “Operation Warp Speed,” which also includes drugmakers, medical distributors and federal agencies. Grocers have emerged as providers of Covid-19 testing for employees and consumers during the pandemic. Many supermarkets have offered customers flu shots for years, but vaccine distribution will require more coordination with state and federal agencies. In addition to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s nationwide distribution, states will receive their own allocation of doses. Many of these details are still being ironed out.

Across the country, dry-ice makers are planning to boost production of the frigid storage material needed to ship hundreds of millions of doses to hospitals, pharmacies and physicians’ offices. Brad Dunn, vice president of Cee Kay Supply Inc., which makes dry ice at three Missouri plants, said he has fielded calls from public-health departments, medical-supply and logistics companies planning to take part in what  Pfizer Inc.  has called its biggest vaccination campaign ever.

The drugmaker expects to distribute 25 million doses in the U.S. this year and another 1.3 billion globally in 2021. Few pharmaceutical products have required such low temperatures for storage and transit. Pfizer’s vaccine must be shipped and stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius to remain stable and effective. The temperature of dry ice is around minus 78 degrees Celsius. A vaccine  Moderna Inc.  is developing must also be stored at cold temperatures, though not as low as those Pfizer’s shot requires.

The clampdown, which started last month, put an end to a hands-off approach that had made the Scandinavian nation a prime example in the often heated global debate between opponents and champions of pandemic lockdowns. Admirers of the Swedish way as far away as the U.S. hailed its benefit to the economy and its respect for fundamental freedoms. Critics called it a gamble with human lives, especially those of the most vulnerable.

It never met the goal; by mid-November, the U.S. Strategic National Stockpile and the Federal Emergency Management Agency held 142 million N95 masks, which filter out at least 95% of small particles and fit snugly to the face. The U.S. also has yet to develop a centralized database to distribute medical gear to all health providers. The Department of Health and Human Services hasn’t adopted key recommendations to ease supply shortages made in September by the U.S. Government Accountability Office. A federal crisis response program hasn’t reached its staffing goals for health responders. The predicament “underscores the critical imperative” for HHS and FEMA to adopt September recommendations to address how it would deal with supply shortages and help states track supply requests, according to a new GAO report released Nov. 30. HHS disagreed with the need to follow GAO recommendations on handling supply shortages. An HHS spokeswoman said some GAO proposals were vague, outdated and based on incomplete data. She said HHS has filled all supply requests made of the stockpile, that some states inflate their needs and that there haven’t been directives to deploy N95 respirators from the stockpile in the past 30 days.

The trick will be figuring out whether they are signal or noise. The Labor Department on Thursday reported that consumer prices rose 0.2% in November, putting them 1.2% higher than a year earlier. Prices excluding food and energy items—the so-called core that economists see as a better reflection of inflation’s underlying trend—were up 0.2% on the month and 1.6% on the year. The inflation indexes the Federal Reserve focuses on, from the Commerce Department, run a bit cooler than the Labor Department measures, so for now inflation isn’t within spitting distance of the 2% the central bank is aiming for. That could change soon. A big reason the year-over-year inflation readings are low now is that there was a dip in prices in March through May, when the Covid crisis first struck. Come next March, that shock will start reaching its first anniversary, and the year-over-year comparisons will appear souped-up as a result. If over the next half year prices on a monthly basis rise by just half as much as they did in November, for example, the Labor Department’s headline inflation measure would be up 2.6% on the year by May, with core prices up 2.3%. But the cycling out of last year’s inflation dip won’t be the only thing going on next spring.

The likely result is a surge in demand, particularly in services categories such as travel.  "

On Wednesday, South Korean President Moon Jae-in convened an emergency meeting after the country saw a nine-month peak of 686 cases that has forced officials to use shipping containers to address a hospital-bed shortage. Japan on Wednesday recorded 2,810 new cases, the government said, its highest daily total yet. Vietnam reported community infections for the first time in around three months, prompting authorities to suspend all inbound commercial flights. Hong Kong, which had taken daily infections down to single digits, has seen cases surge past 100, requiring the reintroduction of limits on dine-in restaurant service and gym closures. Several regions of Malaysia went into lockdown after cases doubled within a month. “We have overcome coronavirus crises several times but now we are in a more serious situation than ever,” said Mr. Moon, during a meeting with officials earlier this week. He called for expanded coronavirus testing, prompting testing sites to extend working hours and reopen drive-through sites. Though the virus tallies pale in comparison with the U.S., Europe and elsewhere, the uptick in outbreaks among Asia’s Covid-19 success stories comes after life had been restored to pre-pandemic levels. But unlike more isolated outbreaks of prior months, this winter upturn is more diffuse, as places once considered havens—a family gathering at home or work sites long reopened—are now the outbreak origins.

In the coming weeks, U.S. health regulators are expected to authorize the emergency use of two Covid-19 vaccines: one from Pfizer Inc. and  BioNTech SE ,  and another from  Moderna Inc.  While researchers haven’t found serious safety issues with the vaccines, they do come with possible side effects mostly of mild to moderate severity, including fever, fatigue, headache and arm pain. Severe allergic reactions are likely to be rare, they say. The two people had a history of allergic reactions and carried adrenaline auto-injectors to deal with their allergies. Both recovered after receiving treatment. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), the body that gave the go-ahead for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in the U.K., has told doctors and hospitals that any person with a history of significant allergic reactions to a vaccine, medicine or food shouldn’t receive the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. That includes people with a previous history of anaphylactoid reactions and those who need to carry adrenaline auto injectors.  "

The idea is that individuals could stop wearing masks and following social-distancing rules if they can prove they have been inoculated and so aren’t a risk to others. Restaurants, theaters and offices could reopen with confidence by admitting those certified as vaccinated, and international travel could resume. As the vaccinated population increases, normal life could gradually resume. Scientists and public-health experts caution, though, that it is too soon to know whether the vaccines being raced into production will confer true and lasting immunity to infection. Nor is it clear if they will be as effective at preventing transmission as they were at reducing the severity of illness in trials. Such proposals raise ethical and political considerations, too, about whether it is wise or just to divide citizens into new categories based on their vaccination status. This debate over the pros and cons of so-called immunity passports as a tool to combat the pandemic has been rekindled by the U.K.’s decision last week, the first by a Western country, to authorize the rollout of a coronavirus vaccine. Elderly citizens and health-care workers started receiving a shot developed by  Pfizer Inc.  and Germany’s BioNTech SE on Tuesday. The Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency are evaluating the vaccine as well as several others and, if cleared, vaccinations in the U.S. and the European Union could begin late this year or early in 2021, health officials in both jurisdictions say.

In recent weeks, Chinese state media, often suggesting the virus came from outside China, have seized on a series of recent studies that show it was spreading outside the country earlier than first assumed. Government officials have also pushed the theory that the virus could have hitched a ride into the central Chinese city of Wuhan on frozen-food imports. After outbreaks in multiple Chinese cities in recent months including Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and elsewhere, authorities pointed to frozen-food packaging as the potential origin. While infectious disease experts say cold surfaces can be vectors for virus transmission, the WHO and other health authorities say the risk of infection from food or its packaging is thought to be low. On Tuesday, a Chinese diplomat based in India posted a story about the possibility of cold-chain transmission on Twitter while calling for further investigation into an unsubstantiated fringe theory that the U.S. military was involved in spreading the virus.

However, health experts cautioned that more information was needed on the Phase 3 trials. The efficacy rate announced by authorities in the U.A.E., where the trials took place, would put the vaccine above the 50% threshold that international scientists deem necessary to protect people. Candidates developed by Moderna Inc. and jointly by            Pfizer Inc.      and BioNTech SE have shown to have efficacy rates of 94.5% and 95% in the final stages of testing, respectively. The U.A.E. Health Ministry didn’t disclose how many trial participants developed Covid-19 and how many of those received a placebo or a vaccine. It also wasn’t known whether the data was peer reviewed. The results were the first from Phase 3 trials of a Chinese Covid-19 vaccine. Nearly one million Chinese people have already received the shot, which was developed by state-owned drugmaker Sinopharm, after the government granted emergency-use authorization for it in July. Public-health experts said that the headline figure suggested that the world had another working vaccine option, although more details were needed. Some questioned why Sinopharm hadn’t jointly presented the results. “I think it’s great news but it’s a little unusual not to come from the study manufacturer,” said Jerome Kim, director of the International Vaccine Institute in Seoul. Among the details that Mr. Kim said were still needed were confidence intervals that could give the public a sense of how reliable the efficacy estimate was. “There are just so many questions around the way it’s been presented.” A U.A.E. official involved in the trial didn’t immediately respond to a request for further information. Sinopharm didn’t respond to a request for comment. The U.A.E. said it had registered the vaccine, paving the way for its wider use, having approved it for emergency use in September. The U.A.E. government and Sinopharm haven’t disclosed the financial details of their trial partnership. The trial began in July, involving about 31,000 volunteers and two different strains of the vaccine. The U.A.E. had previously said one-third of the trial’s participants got a placebo and the remaining two-thirds were administered one of the two strains—one developed in Beijing and another in Wuhan. The U.A.E. said the Beijing strain was 86% effective. It wasn’t known whether an analysis was conducted on the Wuhan strain. While some people who received the vaccine got infected, it said the shot was 100% effective in preventing moderate or severe cases of the disease. The analysis also showed 99% of participants analyzed developed antibodies against the disease. An 86% efficacy rate makes Sinopharm’s vaccine a potential candidate for many countries in emerging markets that can’t immediately gain access to vaccines from the West. Bahrain has already approved emergency use of the vaccine, while China is also testing the candidate in Egypt, Argentina, Jordan, Peru and other countries. Countries running clinical trials generally have a head start in evaluating the vaccine for use by their own people. While Western governments are focused on launching vaccines within their own borders, Chinese officials have talked about sharing their shot in an effort aimed in part at strengthening diplomatic ties.

The candidate developed by Sinopharm, or China National Pharmaceuticals Group, is based on an inactivated virus, meaning that the pathogen is weakened for use on humans. It can be stored at regular refrigerator temperatures, unlike the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, making it an attractive option for poorer countries lacking cold-chain infrastructure. Hani Naja, a partner at law firm Baker McKenzie who covers health-care legislation in the U.A.E., said the health ministry doesn’t regularly green light new medicines and vaccines, as the country’s pharmaceutical manufacturers largely produce generics. But the regulator does have years of experience vetting drugs that have been approved first elsewhere, Mr. Naja said. “It is an encouraging step,” he said. “They have been keen on making sure the vaccine is in the country as soon as possible, but also wanted to make sure it was safe.” Sinopharm previously said that among the nearly one million Chinese people who have been vaccinated, only a few of the people experienced mild symptoms and not a single person had a serious adverse reaction. The U.A.E. has already inoculated tens of thousands of residents with the Sinopharm vaccine since September, offering it to airport staff, teachers and government officials, including police officers, judiciary employees and 30,000 armed forces personnel. U.A.E. officials have said that none have gotten sick with Covid-19. By contrast, Western companies sought government approvals to market their candidates to the public once clinical trials were complete. China has three other Covid-19 experimental vaccines in late-stage trials. Brazil, which is testing Sinovac Biotech Ltd.’s CoronaVac, is expected to release efficacy results in the coming days. Results from early clinical trials of CoronaVac showed that it induced antibodies in volunteers, although at lower levels than those seen in people who were previously infected with Covid-19. China has had to venture overseas to conduct clinical trials on its vaccines as it has successfully controlled the coronavirus at home. Sinopharm executives have said the U.A.E. was chosen for trials due to its diverse population: Only about 10% of the country’s nearly 10 million residents are Emiratis, with the remainder largely from Asia, Europe and the U.S. Corrections & Amplifications 			An earlier version of this article misspelled Pfizer.

Many developed countries maintain lists of who has received vaccines, but those registries can rely on incomplete data provided voluntarily by doctors, pharmacies and even health-care providers that distribute flu shots to corporate clients in winter. The U.S. doesn’t have a national database, but states and some localities maintain their own. Health experts say it will be crucial for governments to monitor accurately who gets inoculated, particularly because many vaccines are under development and some are expected to require multiple doses. Widespread tracking would also enable health officials to detect any adverse reactions, which is important because the vaccines are being developed much faster than usual. “It is mandatory to have this kind of information to protect the health of the population,” said Terry Slevin, chief executive of the Public Health Association of Australia. Government health officials there plan to require health-care providers to report who gets a coronavirus vaccine to that country’s register. Requiring reporting presents several challenges to authorities, including the security of patient health data. Early in the pandemic, an Australian government initiative to develop an app that would record whether someone was in contact with anyone infected with the coronavirus foundered when many people avoided it on privacy grounds.

Now, thanks to Covid-19, they are full-time residents of the Quechee Club, a golf club community in Vermont. The family never would have made such a move if it weren’t for the pandemic. “I never thought I’d end up with this type of life,” she said. “If you asked me two years ago if that was going to be the case, I would have told you you’re crazy.” After years of slow sales and stagnant prices, homes in residential golf club communities across the country are seeing a surge in demand amid the pandemic. But for many home buyers, golf is only part of the attraction. Buyers like Ms. Bueno say they are drawn to these communities because they offer myriad options for outdoor sports, dining and socializing when Covid has curtailed many other forms of entertainment. Clubs’ ability to limit access to their facilities makes residents feel insulated from the virus. “Covid may have affected the consumer outlook on where they want to reside, most likely due to safety and security of the club and being in a controlled environment,” said Jason Becker of Golf Life Navigators, a company that helps home buyers find golf clubs. The fact that many private clubs this summer didn’t allow guests, for example, was “very attractive to somebody in their 60s who is fearful of Covid.” A November Golf Life Navigators survey of people looking to join golf clubs found that 63% of respondents said they wanted to live inside a gated golf community versus outside it, up from 51% pre-pandemic. It remains to be seen if the upsurge in demand for golf homes is temporary, or reflects a permanent shift in buyers’ preferences. After overdevelopment in the 1980s and 1990s, golf communities have struggled in recent years as participation in the costly and time-consuming sport declined, forcing many courses to close. Golf participation peaked in 2001 with roughly 30 million people; by 2017 it had dropped to approximately 24 million, according to the National Golf Foundation."

Now some public health experts are weighing a counterintuitive idea for how they could help end it. They are suggesting that athletes get earlier access to the coronavirus vaccines. The process of injecting 330 million Americans with a vaccine for a disease that wasn’t identified one year ago began as a marvel of science and medicine. Soon it will be a daunting logistical challenge. And then it will be a vexing behavioral problem. There are too many people who want the vaccine right now and too many people who don’t want the vaccine at all. That’s where the athletes would come in. Researchers say that prominent people getting the vaccine and urging others to get the vaccine could help overcome widespread skepticism—especially in the Black community. Polls have shown that vaccine mistrust is greatest among Black adults. “I could envisage celebrity sports figures playing a very constructive role with vaccine hesitancy,” said Harvey Fineberg, a former dean of Harvard’s School of Public Health and former president of the Institute of Medicine. “I could imagine a campaign that enlisted professional sports. ‘Let’s get everyone back in the game’ could be one tagline.

Not just the health crisis—the economic and fiscal crises emerging in its wake, and the wave of protests for racial and economic justice that has swept up alongside it, are altering the way we live and work in powerful ways. This Great Urban Reset gives us a once-in-a-century opportunity to create more equitable and inclusive communities of all sizes and shapes. In the wake of the 2008 economic crash, I identified the Great Resets that remake and recharge economic systems in the wake of crises. They do so by giving rise to new ways of living and working that enable the economy to expand and grow. I called attention to two—the rise of great industrial cities like Detroit and Pittsburgh at the end of the Long Depression in the second half of the 19th century, and the wave of suburbanization that spurred economic growth after the Great Depression and World War II. We are going through a third today, which began during the 2008 economic crisis and is being ushered into place by the Covid crisis. First, Covid-19 will not kill off cities like New York and London. Global cities will not only survive but revive—as they did after even deadlier epidemics, economic crises, wars and natural disasters in the past—as their commercial spaces are transformed into mixed-use areas where people live and work. This is because the clustering force—of talent and innovation—is a core characteristic of this new reset. But, smaller cities and suburbs as well as rural areas also have the ability to thrive as people flock to them because of their ability to do far-flung jobs remotely. This pandemic, like pandemics through all of human history, is not a fundamental disrupter but an accelerator of trends already under way: “pull forces” that draw certain groups, like families with children, out of cities, and “push forces” that impel others, like the young and the ambitious, techies and artistic creatives, into cities, especially as they become more affordable.

Few have benefited more than Austin. Texas’ capital is attracting more corporate jobs and remote workers than  ever before, lured by lower costs and lower taxes. Business relocations to Austin announced this year are expected to create nearly 10,000 jobs. That is the city’s highest figure on record for a single year, according to the Austin Chamber of Commerce, and is helping offset the hit from Covid-19 to the city’s tourist-dependent restaurants, bars and music venues. It helps that Texas has no state income tax, that Austin winters are relatively short and mild, and that social distancing is easier in a city where homes tend to be roomy and many have backyards. Austin has also managed to remain cheaper than San Francisco, Brooklyn and Manhattan by building tens of thousands of apartments over the past decade. Tech investor Joe Lonsdale said he and his venture-capital firm 8VC were moving to Austin, and  Royal Dutch Shell  recently opened a studio to develop energy-exploration ideas in the city, among others who have made or plan the move. “It’s just a whole lot easier to hire. It’s a lot easier to get housing. It’s a lot easier to get business licenses than it is in other places,” said Greg Schwartz, chief executive of real-estate startup Tomo Networks. His company, based in Stamford, Conn., is preparing to open a co-headquarters in Austin."

And even in the developing world, the recovery has been uneven. “China is in recovery, and that helps its neighbors, so in Southeast Asia, there has been more of a recovery underway that extends to Japan,” Mr. Malpass said. “For other developing countries, advanced economies are the most important variable because that’s often where their markets are.” The pandemic has caused the global economy to collapse this year, throwing nearly 100 million people into extreme poverty in many poor countries.

But hurdles exist, the U.S. government’s top infectious-disease expert said. They include people’s hesitancy to get vaccinated, a successful and swift vaccination program, and getting through a rise in Covid-19 cases that is now being fueled in part by misinformation about the virus, Dr. Fauci said at The Wall Street Journal’s CEO Council Summit on Tuesday. “There are a substantial proportion of people who do think this is not real, that it’s fake news, or it’s a hoax. This is extraordinary. I’ve never seen this before,” he said. Dr. Fauci added that he will convey the following to President-elect Joe Biden’s administration: “We have all got to be on the same page telling the American public we have to pull together. That, to me, is the most important thing.” Dr. Fauci and Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus-response coordinator, who also spoke Tuesday at the summit, both reiterated their calls for people to adopt public-health measures to combat the spread of the virus. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently said the virus infected people in the U.S. in mid-December 2019, a few weeks before it was officially identified in China and about a month earlier than public-health authorities found the first U.S. case. It has since caused almost 15 million diagnosed cases and more than 283,000 deaths. Cases have surged since the fall, with more than 2,000 daily deaths being reported. It is too early to know whether the Thanksgiving holiday will add an additional spurt of cases.  "

The Covid-19 pandemic forced Americans to collectively swap the physical for the digital world in a matter of months. As retailers learn to operate without stores, business travelers without airplanes, and workers without offices, much of what started out as a temporary expedient is likely to become permanent. “Covid has acted like a time machine: it brought 2030 to 2020,” said Loren Padelford, vice president at  Shopify Inc.  “All those trends, where organizations thought they had more time, got rapidly accelerated.”  Merchants using the company’s e-commerce platform shot up more than 20% between January and June to 1.4 million, according to broker Robert W. Baird & Co. The reverberations are already apparent in everything from the stock market to corporate spending patterns to the decline of physical cash. Investors in 2020 rewarded companies with digital-intensive, asset-light business models such as online used car seller  Carvana Co. , Airbnb Inc. and  Amazon.com Inc.  or firms that supply the infrastructure that makes those models possible—like Shopify,  Zoom Video Communications Inc.  and Microsoft Corp. Businesses are now spending less on office space and travel and more on cloud computing, collaboration software and logistics. In many ways, digitization is simply the next chapter of a process under way for a century: the dematerialization of the economy. As agriculture gave way to manufacturing and then services, the share of economic value derived from tangible material and muscle shrunk while the share derived from information and brains grew. Former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan liked to note that economic output has steadily gotten lighter.  "

Data released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Tuesday showed that life expectancy rose to 78.8 years in 2019, an increase of one-tenth of a year, marking the second consecutive year of progress on the key measure of national well-being. The main drivers were lower death rates from heart disease and cancer, the country’s no. 1 and no. 2 causes of death, respectively, said Robert Anderson, chief of the mortality-statistics branch of the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics. The death rate from drug overdoses rose after declining the prior year, while the suicide death rate fell for the first time since 2005. Last year’s slim gain will be erased by a large drop in longevity when the government releases 2020 figures next year. Mr. Anderson said he performed a simple simulation based on mortality figures through August and found that life expectancy had declined by about 1½ years. For the full year, he expects that life expectancy could fall by two to three years. “We’ve had a lot of deaths added since August, so I think a drop of two to three years for 2020 isn’t out of the question,” Mr. Anderson said. He said his figures are rough estimates and that the government needs complete data to measure the exact impact of the pandemic on U.S. mortality.  "

The $900 billion in relief, paired with a $1.4 trillion bill to continue government funding into September, excluded the Republican priority of liability protection for businesses and other entities, and left out a pot for state and local funding desired by Democrats. Mr. Trump signed the bill even though it didn’t include the larger stimulus checks he had demanded. Here are some highlights of what is in the legislation based on the text and summary of the legislation and lawmakers’ statements. The legislation would authorize a second round of economic-impact payments, following the checks Americans received in the spring and summer, at a cost of $166 billion. Households would receive $600 for each adult and $600 for each dependent, instead of $1,200 and $500, respectively, in the first round. Mixed-status households, where some people are ineligible noncitizens, would get payments based on the number of eligible people in the households, as opposed to being shut out as they were in the first round. The payments would be based on income from 2019 and begin phasing out for individuals with adjusted gross incomes over $75,000 and married couples over $150,000. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Monday that the first electronic payments could reach bank accounts by the beginning of next week.  "

Brazil is the first country to complete Phase 3 trials of the Chinese company’s CoronaVac vaccine, which is also being tested in Indonesia and Turkey. With Covid-19 largely under control in China, the country’s vaccine developers have had to conduct their clinical trials abroad. People involved in the Brazilian trials, which completed Phase 3 last week, told The Wall Street Journal that the results showed CoronaVac with an effective rate above 50%, the threshold for a vaccine to be considered viable by international scientists. The people declined to give any further information. But scientists tracking the vaccine’s development say they expect it to show efficacy comparable to other Covid-19 vaccines that have proven 95% effective in trials. “Everyone is hoping for an efficacy rate above 90%,” said Domingos Alves, a professor at Ribeirão Preto Medical School in São Paulo who specializes in analyzing health data. “The results from the first phases of trials were very good.” Brazil’s Butantan Institute, the research center backed by the São Paulo state government that has been testing CoronaVac, is poised to announce the vaccine’s efficacy rate on Wednesday.

Last spring, with less known about the disease, doctors often pre-emptively put patients on ventilators or gave powerful sedatives largely abandoned in recent years. The aim was to save the seriously ill and protect hospital staff from Covid-19. Now hospital treatment for the most critically ill looks more like it did before the pandemic. Doctors hold off longer before placing patients on ventilators. Patients get less powerful sedatives, with doctors checking more frequently to see if they can halt the drugs entirely and dialing back how much air ventilators push into patients’ lungs with each breath. “Let us go back to basics,” said Dr. Eduardo Oliveira, executive medical director for critical-care services for AdventHealth Central Florida, which recommends its doctors stick with pre-pandemic guidelines for ventilator use. “The less you deviate from it, the better.” Advances also include new drugs, most notably steroids, for severely ill patients."

Americans have long relied on institutions to care for the frailest seniors. The U.S. has the largest number of nursing-home residents in the world. But families and some doctors have been reluctant to send patients to such facilities, fearing infection and isolation in places ravaged by Covid-19, which has caused more than 115,000 deaths linked to U.S. long-term-care institutions. The drop-off has persisted since spring, including at times when the virus’s spread was subdued. In the summer, when many hospitals were performing near-normal levels of the kinds of procedures that often result in nursing-home stays, referrals to nursing homes remained down. Occupancy in U.S. nursing homes is down by 15%, or more than 195,000 residents, since the end of 2019, driven both by deaths and by the fall in admissions, a Wall Street Journal analysis of federal data shows.

In a Wednesday afternoon statement on the defense measure released by the White House, Mr. Trump objected to some of the provisions related to the removal of Confederate base names and troop levels abroad, as well as the legislation’s lack of language revoking internet platforms’ broad immunity for the content they publish from users on their sites. The president had called on lawmakers to terminate Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. Mr. Trump has targeted that section of the law, arguing that social-media giants like Facebook and Twitter use it to suppress conservative voices on their platforms. The annual defense bill sets pay rates for troops and authorizes funds for military construction projects, aircraft, ships, nuclear weapons and other national-security programs. It also includes items related to anti-money-laundering efforts, cybersecurity and the U.S. border wall. This year, the House approved final passage 335-78 and the Senate passed it 84-13.  "

People with such disorders, who account for one in 50 Americans, are on average more than 2½ times as likely to die from Covid-19 as the wider U.S. population, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of data from 12 states. The analysis mirrors similar, recent studies. One study, conducted by nonprofit organization FAIR Health, found the group’s death rate is higher than many others already widely recognized as particularly vulnerable to the disease. The higher rate is because many people with these disorders suffer from conditions such as respiratory and heart disease, which are known to contribute to lower rates of survival from Covid-19, medical experts say. Family members and caregivers are concerned that the vulnerable won’t be prioritized for vaccines despite the high death rates. They say people with these conditions have been consistently ignored by officials throughout the pandemic and the disorders are little understood even by medical professionals, making diagnoses and treatments more difficult. “They have been an afterthought,” said Margaret Puddington, whose 40-year-old son has Cornelia de Lange syndrome, a rare disorder, and who earlier this month appeared before a panel of the New York City Council Committee on Health to argue for people with intellectual development disorders to be among the first to receive a vaccine.

How did it happen so quickly? In part, the world can thank decades of frustrating and often fruitless research to find a vaccine for Human Immunodeficiency Virus or HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. Many of the new technologies and approaches employed to create potent Covid-19 vaccines and therapies trace their origins to the desperate search, starting in the early 1980s, to slow the spread of HIV. AIDS has claimed 33 million lives to date, and 38 million people are currently living with HIV. There is still no vaccine. But since 1982, the U.S. has invested more than $76 billion in lifesaving treatments, quietly revolutionizing the development of vaccines and therapies for other viruses, including the coronavirus. “Everything we do with every other pathogen spins off of things we’ve learned with HIV,” said Anthony Fauci, a leader in HIV research as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984. Scientists haven’t yet been able to develop an effective AIDS vaccine, partly because HIV is one of the most cunning, complex pathogens ever encountered. Like the coronavirus, HIV has a spike or envelope protein that binds to receptors on the surface of cells, but in HIV it doesn’t stay intact long enough to be efficiently attacked by the immune system. Over decades of work, however, HIV researchers developed a better understanding of the complex workings of the immune system. They mapped out in detail how HIV invades cells and replicates, and identified weak spots in the virus that can be targeted by drugs. Using X-ray crystallography and later electron microscopy, combined with computer modeling, researchers created highly detailed three-dimensional images of proteins on the surface of HIV. The idea was to use the images to engineer antigens, molecules that generate an immune response and prompt the body to mount a defense against the virus.  "

Around 611 people are dying of Covid-19 in Italy on an average day, behind only Brazil and the U.S. This year Italy has recorded about 68,900 confirmed deaths from the virus, the highest total in Europe and fifth in the world after the U.S., Brazil, India and Mexico—which all have much bigger populations. Once again, Italians are asking themselves: Why is Covid-19 killing more people here than almost anywhere else? The answer lies partly in demographics, public health experts say. Italy has one of the world’s oldest populations, second only to Japan. Nearly one in four Italians is over 65, an age group much more likely to succumb to the disease. Another factor: Multigenerational homes are especially common in Italy, potentially exposing older people to infection from their younger relatives."

The president’s announcement stunned Washington, where Monday’s vote on the deal—with concessions from both parties—had capped a bitter, monthslong fight. Democrats said they would press to pass more assistance next year. Mr. Trump’s resistance is likely to delay payments to Americans, upending a plan unveiled by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin—a key negotiator on the package—for the first batch of payments to go out at the beginning of next week. The legislation, which includes $900 billion in coronavirus relief and a $1.4 trillion spending bill that funds the government through September, passed both chambers by wide margins—92-6 in the Senate and 359-53 in the House—and had been expected to be signed by the president. If he vetoes it, lawmakers would need to either pass new legislation meeting his demand for larger stimulus checks or vote to override his veto—which requires a two-thirds threshold for passage in each chamber.

British authorities have said the new variant of the coronavirus is more contagious than the existing one—prompting a raft of countries to cut off travel to and from the U.K. A more contagious version of the virus means a greater number of people than originally expected would need to be vaccinated to halt its spread, said Ugur Sahin, CEO of BioNTech. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is now being deployed in the U.S. and U.K. and is expected to roll out in the European Union from next week. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient proportion of a population has been immunized by vaccination or after having been infected, effectively ending the disease’s spread. The threshold at which herd immunity is achieved varies between diseases. That threshold is related to the speed of the viral spread, known as R. Most experts agree the herd immunity threshold for coronavirus is between 60% and 70% of a population.  "

With vaccines finally being administered, we should be entering a joyous phase. Instead we endure still more inflammatory rhetoric and media distortion. Americans need to understand three realities. First, all 50 states independently directed and implemented their own pandemic policies. In every case, governors and local officials were responsible for on-the-ground choices—every business limit, school closing, shelter-in-place order and mask requirement. No policy on any of these issues was set by the federal government, except those involving federal property and employees. Second, nearly all states used the same draconian policies that people now insist on hardening, even though the number of positive cases increased while people’s movements were constrained, business activities were strictly limited, and schools were closed. Governors in all but a few states—Florida and South Dakota are notable exceptions—imposed curfews, quarantines, directives on group gatherings, and mask mandates. Mobility tracking verifies that people restricted their movement. Gallup and YouGov data show that 80% to 90% of Americans have been wearing masks since early August. Lockdown policies had baleful effects on local economies, families and children, and the virus spread anyway. If one advocates more lockdowns because of bad outcomes so far, why don’t the results of those lockdowns matter? Third, the federal government’s role in the pandemic has been grossly mischaracterized by the media and their Democratic allies. That distortion has obscured several significant successes, while undermining the confidence of ordinary Americans. Federal financial support and directives enabled the development of a massive, state-of-the-art testing capacity and produced billions of dollars of personal protective equipment. Federal agencies met all requests for supplemental medical personnel and hospital-bed capacity. Officials in the Health and Human Services Department have told me there are no unmet requests for extra resources.  "

MRNA 3.29%            are slated to start Monday, boosting the mass inoculation campaign that was launched just last week. Drug distributor            McKesson Corp.      began picking up doses of the vaccine from manufacturing plants on Saturday for distribution around the country.            United Parcel Service Inc.      and            FedEx Corp.      trucks started rolling out Sunday to deliver the doses to hospitals and other sites. The federal government plans to distribute over the coming week a total of 7.9 million doses of vaccines from Moderna and            Pfizer Inc.,              PFE 0.05%            which developed the first Covid-19 shot authorized for use in the U.S. “The second vaccine from Moderna, added to the Pfizer vaccine, now allows us to be on the offense” against the coronavirus pandemic, Gen. Gustave Perna, who is overseeing the federal vaccine-distribution plan, said Saturday. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Friday authorized the emergency use of Moderna’s vaccine in people 18 years and older, citing the shot’s high effectiveness in preventing Covid-19 in a large clinical study. A panel of doctors and public-health officials advising the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention voted on Saturday to recommend that people receive the Moderna vaccine. “This represents progress toward ending this horrific pandemic,” said committee member Beth Bell, a professor of global health at the University of Washington. The clearance came a week after the FDA authorized use of the first Covid-19 vaccine in the U.S., developed by Pfizer and its German partner            BioNTech SE.      The CDC committee also recommended the Pfizer vaccine last week.  Health authorities view inoculations as crucial to allowing people to gather in large numbers, and for schools, businesses and other establishments to fully reopen. During the first week of the mass immunization campaign, Pfizer shipped 2.9 million doses of its vaccine, which largely went to health-care workers and residents of long-term care facilities. Many hospitals, nursing homes and other sites in more rural areas, however, missed out because they lacked the freezers capable of storing the shots at ultracold temperatures. These hospitals and other vaccination sites have been waiting for Moderna’s vaccine, which also must be kept cold but at higher temperatures that most standard medical freezers can accommodate. Another factor making Moderna’s shot more accessible for smaller and harder-to-reach vaccination sites, Gen. Perna said, is the shipment sizes. An order for Moderna’s vaccine contains 100 doses, while Pfizer’s has 975. George Garrow,      chief medical officer for the Primary Health Network, said the health centers it covers across rural Pennsylvania are pleased that they will be among the first to receive the Moderna vaccine this week. They have been preparing for the vaccine since mid-November by training staff in procedures, finding venues to administer it, developing a tracking process to ensure follow-up immunizations and determining vaccine demand among staff and administration capabilities at various clinics, he said. “We recognized that the Pfizer vaccine was not a good option for smaller Community Health Centers due to the cold-storage requirements and the incremental allotments of 975 doses,” Dr. Garrow said in an email. This week, the federal government planned for deliveries of 5.9 million doses of Moderna’s vaccine and two million doses of Pfizer’s. december distribution target   20 million people FIRST TO GET THE VACCINE Health-care personnel 21 million (U.S. population) Long-term care facility residents 3 million Each figure = 1 million people january distribution target   30 million people SECOND-highest priority Essential workers (non-health care) 87 million february–march distribution target at least 50 million people April–June distribution target  50 million people third highest 100 million Adults with high-risk medical conditions  53 million Adults age 65+ years Notes: Based on the timing of first dose. Each person is given two doses, three to four weeks apart.  Because of overlap between groups, the number of adults over 65 and those with high-risk conditions in line for vaccinations is smaller than their combined populations, and some would be vaccinated earlier. Sources: Department of Health and Human Services (vaccination goals); CDC (prioritized groups)Erik Brynildsen, Todd Lindeman, Josh Ulick and Taylor Umlauf/THE WALL STREET JOURNAL Michael Dacey, president of Riverside Health System, a Virginia-based health-care provider that encompasses five hospitals and 10 nursing homes, said his company is anticipating an allocation of 5,000 initial doses of the Moderna vaccine in the coming weeks. Riverside has already received 2,800 initial doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, according to Dr. Dacey. Altogether, he said, the supplies won’t be enough for a system with 10,000 employees, as well as 1,300 nursing-home residents. “It is going to leave us short, no doubt,” he said. Jimmy Lewis, chief executive officer of HomeTown Health LLC, an Atlanta-based company that serves as a consultant to rural hospitals throughout Georgia, expressed concern that some people living around the hospitals might be hesitant to take the vaccine. “We get the vaccines, but how do we convince people that this is the right thing?” he said. Other challenges remain in rolling out both vaccines. This past week, some shipments of Pfizer’s vaccine had temperature variations that required them to be returned for replacement doses. And several states, including Illinois, Michigan and Iowa, complained they weren’t getting as many doses of Pfizer’s vaccine as expected. Gen. Perna apologized for the miscommunication, saying he had given states larger estimates earlier based on projections of how many Pfizer doses would be available for shipment. Pfizer said it is coordinating closely with federal officials to deliver as many doses as possible to people in the U.S. Gen. Perna said he still expects that enough doses to vaccinate about 20 million people will be allocated by the end of December, though distribution of those doses might now spill into the first week of January. Moderna, of Cambridge, Mass., has been manufacturing doses of its vaccine at its plant in nearby Norwood, Mass. Contract manufacturer            Lonza Group AG      is also making doses at plants in New Hampshire and Switzerland. The U.S.-made doses are sent to a plant in Bloomington, Ind., operated by contract manufacturer            Catalent Inc.      It fills vials with the vaccine and packs them for shipment. Catalent said its employees are working around the clock to supply 20 million doses of Moderna’s vaccine by the end of the month, and hundreds of millions of doses next year. Get a coronavirus briefing six days a week, and a weekly Health newsletter once the crisis abates: Sign up here. McKesson started picking up the doses from Catalent on Saturday and moving them to distribution hubs. UPS and FedEx began collecting the supplies Sunday and delivering them to sites. The first truck, belonging to FedEx, left McKesson’s distribution center in Olive Branch, Miss., about 9 a.m., a McKesson spokeswoman said. UPS and FedEx will deliver both vaccine doses and kits that contain needles and syringes necessary to inject the shots. Doses are being sent to hospitals initially because federal and state officials have said health-care workers should be among the first to be vaccinated with the limited supply. Another priority group, residents of nursing homes and other long-term care facilities, are also starting to get inoculated. Pharmacy chains            CVS Health Corp.      and            Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc.      are conducting vaccinations at these sites.

This fall, he began rethinking it. A growing body of research and data suggested the virus wasn’t spreading widely in schools. An email from a star football player who had been sidelined from a playoff game became a turning point. The student, senior Brady Comello, had been seated in class, masked, near another student who later tested positive. “I am so upset right now that I have to miss my first playoff game and possibly my last high school game ever,” Mr. Comello wrote, pleading for Mr. Cooper to reconsider the rule. Even with coronavirus cases beginning to rise again across the country, student quarantines were more stringent than they needed to be, Mr. Cooper decided. He forwarded the email to Gov.

However, Brazil’s Butantan Institute, the research center backed by São Paulo’s state government that has been testing CoronaVac, said Sinovac asked for 15 more days to analyze the data together with results from other trials of the vaccine, which is also being tested in Indonesia and Turkey. “There can’t be three efficacy results for the same vaccine,” said Butantan’s director, Dimas Covas. He said the delay had nothing to do with the efficacy of the vaccine, which is expected to be one of the first approved for use in Brazil. Scientists tracking the vaccine had hoped CoronaVac would be comparable to other Covid-19 vaccines that have shown to be as much as 95% effective. “It was very frustrating…this is the only vaccine we have at the moment on Brazilian soil,” said Luiz Carlos Dias, part of a Covid-19 task force of researchers at the University of Campinas in São Paulo state. “I’m worried that perhaps the efficacy rate is not so high after all.”  "

Facebook Inc.,   Marriott International Inc.,  and  Discover Financial Services  are among big employers saying they will urge vaccinations and highlight the benefits of doing so but stop short of requiring them. Covid-19 vaccines are likely to be available to anyone in the U.S. who wants one by the end of the second quarter, federal officials said this week. Some employers plan to provide 401(k) or other cash incentives to staff, as they do to encourage use of other wellness benefits, or bar unvaccinated employees from certain activities. Several executives have said they would offer their corporate facilities to public-health officials as vaccine administration sites in making shots convenient for workers. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission last week released guidance noting that employers can generally require their workers to get vaccinated and may ask employees for proof that they have done so. Employers are bound to accommodate employees who object because of religious beliefs or because they have a medical condition that makes it unsafe for them to get a vaccine. Human-resources leaders and chief executives say they aren’t mandating vaccinations because they want to respect the views of those who lack confidence in the new vaccines, avoid liability if there are adverse reactions and not infringe on religious or personal beliefs. The approach is similar to how large companies often handle seasonal flu shots, though this vaccine targets a novel virus that shut down many workplaces across the country, corporate medical advisers say.

The British government said on Saturday the new strain appeared to be spreading 70% faster than earlier variants and is responsible for a surge in cases in London and its surrounding areas. Recorded cases across the U.K. in the week to Sunday rose 51% over the week before. The emergence of the variant presents a serious setback for suppressing the pandemic before new vaccines can be rolled out across the country, suggesting major restrictions will continue into the new year. There is no evidence so far that the new variant causes more serious infections or will neutralize the vaccines, British scientists say, but there are concerns it will make controlling the virus’s spread less manageable, even with a vaccine. Viruses mutate constantly and scientists are constantly on the alert for new mutations that may affect how the virus behaves. The new strain hasn’t been identified in the U.S. The British government imposed a new lockdown on the affected regions, including the closure of all nonessential retail, and abandoned plans to allow a five-day truce of Covid-19 restrictions across the country over Christmas where three households could mingle.

Mexico began administering 3,000 doses from Pfizer, and Argentina will start inoculations next week after 300,000 doses of Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine arrived Thursday from Moscow on an Argentine state aircraft. The first injections in Mexico and Chile were broadcast live on television. “It was something unexpected, I’m very excited,” said Zulema Riquelme, a 46-year-old Chilean nurse who works with Covid-19 patients and became the first in that country to receive the vaccine. “These have been difficult months because I haven’t been able to see my family, a lot of exhaustion. I feel proud that they chose me.” The arrival of the vaccines, which most countries are administering first to front-line health-care workers before giving them to the elderly, offers a glimmer of hope for a region of 650 million that has logged over 470,000 deaths from Covid-19, about 30% of the world’s total, and more than 14 million cases. With a new surge of deaths and cases now hammering the region, health officials in most countries are still negotiating purchases with pharmaceutical companies or awaiting delivery of vaccines early next year.

A Wall Street Journal review of data from more than two dozen nations with significant elder-care facilities shows that such institutions are tied to more than a third of Covid-19 deaths, though they typically house less than 2% of the population. These countries linked at least 233,000 of 641,000 overall Covid-19 deaths to nursing homes and other long-term elder-care sites. In the U.S. alone, the death toll tied to these facilities tops 125,000. Nursing homes were a soft target for a highly contagious and deadly virus because they house the frailest people in proximity. The new coronavirus has generally proved most dangerous for the elderly, who have had the highest mortality rates overall. But even among older people susceptible to Covid-19, nursing homes proved uniquely perilous. An analysis published in November in the Journal of Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine looked at a dozen Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development member countries and found the Covid-19 mortality rate among long-term care residents was more than 20 times higher than that among older people living outside such facilities. The devastating toll wasn’t inevitable. Countries such as South Korea managed to limit the deaths among nursing-home residents by avoiding widespread community outbreaks and moving quickly to prevent infections from spreading inside the facilities. Even as it faces a recent surge of Covid-19 cases, the entire east Asian nation has still reported only about 70 long-term care deaths in total. Eight U.S. states have reported more than 7,000 deaths."

He signed the legislation under pressure from lawmakers of both parties. In a statement, the president called on Congress to remove what he called wasteful spending in the bill and said he would send lawmakers a list of provisions he wants eliminated—an effort that Democrats said they will block. The president also said he expects Congress to vote on separate legislation to increase direct payments to $2,000. The House was already planning to vote on such a bill on Monday. Mr. Trump said the Senate will “start the process” to vote on legislation to increase the direct payments, as well as roll back Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act and investigate alleged voter fraud. “Much more money is coming,” Mr. Trump said. “I will never give up my fight for the American people!”  "

Of the more than 12 million doses of vaccines from  Moderna Inc.  and  Pfizer Inc.  with  BioNTech  SE that have been shipped, only 2.8 million have been administered, according to federal figures. The reported shortfall is due in part to a lag in reporting data using new tools, government officials and health experts said. But as the federal government has left it to states to determine what to do with the vaccines it ships to them, and with some states pushing decision-making to local health departments and hospitals, the process has gone far from smoothly. People in Florida are waiting in hourslong lines to get shots on a first-come, first-served basis. Some West Virginians got a Covid-19 treatment instead of vaccines. A medical practice in Texas had only two workers sign up to take the shots. While some states received fewer doses than they expected and some hospitals got their first ones this week, other health-care providers have more doses than they know what to do with and are scrambling to find enough syringes to use them.

Zhang Zhan, 37 years old, was convicted of “picking quarrels and provoking trouble” after a roughly 2½-hour trial at the Shanghai Pudong New Area People’s Court on Monday, where prosecutors accused her of spreading falsehoods about the coronavirus pandemic through social-media posts and interviews with overseas media, her lawyers said. The verdict came more than seven months after authorities detained Ms. Zhang in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, the pandemic’s original epicenter, where she posted more than 120 YouTube videos chronicling conditions in the city and detailed what she saw as missteps in the government’s initial pandemic response. Her detention dovetails with Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s campaign to recast the coronavirus pandemic in China as a showcase of the Communist Party’s good governance, featuring extensive propaganda and censorship efforts aimed at mollifying public anger and suppressing criticism against missteps in the government’s initial response. The case against Ms. Zhang is the first known prosecution of a citizen journalist who covered the coronavirus pandemic in Wuhan, where government efforts to punish whistleblowers and suppress information on the early outbreak stirred a public backlash and prompted some ordinary citizens to chronicle conditions in Wuhan with firsthand accounts over social media. At least three other citizen journalists in Wuhan disappeared in February and, though one of them briefly resurfaced in April, their fate remains unclear, rights activists say.  "

After clearing regulators at home on Wednesday, the partners face the challenge of convincing medicine watchdogs in the U.S. and elsewhere that their missteps are behind them and that their vaccine, while not as effective as shots from two rivals already rolling out, can play a meaningful role in curbing the pandemic. The partners have promised to distribute their vaccine in huge quantities and sell it cheaply throughout the pandemic. In the U.S., AstraZeneca expects to have data from a large American clinical trial to show to the Food and Drug Administration by February, said a person familiar with the trial. The partners hope for authorization across Europe by February, and a green light in Australia could also come soon, this person said. AstraZeneca’s manufacturing partner in India has asked for regulatory authorization there. All depend on regulatory sign-off. Complicating those plans are doubts seeded by the partners’ own handling of their ambitious project. In late November, they unveiled late-stage trial results that showed a wide range of efficacy levels, varying by dose and age group. The presentation, which described an unusual and unexpected half-dose given to some subjects that wasn’t fully explained, sowed confusion and skepticism about the vaccine."

But one town claims to have found a formula to prevent high mortality without a draconian lockdown. The southern German city of Tübingen was hit hard by the virus in the spring, but measures such as widely available testing and even subsidizing taxi rides have since managed to protect the elderly, who make up most of the fatalities. At the peak of the first wave in April, the town had 70 Covid-19 patients in its biggest hospital—out of 89,000 inhabitants—including 33 in intensive care, forcing doctors to cancel elective surgery. Now, at the height of the far more devastating current surge, patients number just 35, many transferred from other regions. Fifteen of them are in intensive care, of whom fewer than half are Tübingen residents. The hospital hasn’t canceled non-urgent surgery. Local authorities say such numbers are no accident. The town, they point out, started earlier than most German municipalities in carrying out frequent Covid-19 tests on care-home staff, residents and visitors. It subsidizes taxi rides for those over age 65 so they don’t have to use public transit. Younger residents are discouraged from shopping between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. so as to avoid seniors having to mingle with people who are more likely to carry the virus without symptoms. Tübingen’s pandemic policy has so far cost it half a million euros, all financed through the town‘s budget. A week of the current lockdown, with restaurants and all nonessential stores closed, costs the German economy and the state between €27 billion and €57 billion in lost output and subsidies, according to estimates by the Ifo Institute, a government-funded economics think tank in Munich.

At the same time, they were on a buying spree in the country’s oil patch. Since spring, businesses controlled by the Wilks brothers have hunted for deals among fracking firms going through bankruptcy and taken or increased stakes in at least six other companies, corporate filings show. But when it looked like the oil-and-gas industry would be shut out of a key pandemic lending program, they and others in the industry turned their attention to Washington, making an appeal for help in meetings with home-state senator Ted Cruz. The twin dynamics of acquisitions and government rescue show how the economic tumult caused by the pandemic has reshaped the landscape for a key U.S. industry. One result: The Wilkses have expanded their presence in a still-youthful industry where they first invested in 2002, soon to become billionaires as fracking flourished. But the industry was already under pressure from international competition and a sagging oil price by the time the pandemic hit, and its mounting woes prompted the Wilkses and others to turn to allies in Washington, including Mr. Cruz. The Republican senator helped convince the Trump administration and the Federal Reserve to change the rules for pandemic loans to ensure oil and gas firms could participate. Soon after the U.S. government changed the rules of its lending program in April, a Wilks family company, ProFrac Holdings LLC, applied for and received a $35 million loan, federal records show. ProFrac, a supplier of pumping equipment and services, is just one slice of the sprawling portfolio of fracking businesses that the Wilks family owns in part or outright across the American West and Canada.

The Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network cautioned on Monday of an array of vaccine-related crimes, including the sale of unapproved, counterfeit or illegally marketed vaccines. In addition, fraudsters have offered to provide individuals with a vaccine sooner than provided under authorized distribution plans, FinCEN said. Cybercriminals, meanwhile, have targeted vaccine researchers with ransomware, the Treasury unit said. It warned financial institutions as well as their customers to be on the lookout for phishing schemes seeking to snare victims with misinformation about vaccines. Our Morning Risk Report features insights and news on governance, risk and compliance. Financial institutions are required to report all transactions that might be dubious. Such suspicious activity reports, or SARs, are intended to help federal authorities disrupt the flow of money to terrorists, drug traffickers, arms proliferators and other bad actors. FinCEN asked that banks pay close attention to Treasury-issued guidance on reporting suspicious activity, particularly pertaining to the Covid-19 pandemic. The Treasury unit called on banks to offer detail on how a possible scammer contacted the purported victim and how payments were made or attempted. FinCEN also highlighted Treasury guidance from October, which warned victims of ransomware schemes and financial institutions that they could be violating sanctions or anti-money-laundering rules if they facilitate or make payments to their attackers. Law enforcement agencies including the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Interpol also issued warnings this month about vaccine-related fraud.  For financial institutions, fraud tied to vaccines is among the latest compliance risks to emerge from the pandemic. Banks have had to contend with fraud stemming from a surge in unemployment claims, for instance. They have also had to monitor fraud risks related to government relief initiatives such as the Paycheck Protection Program. “Banks have a lot on their plate, and this is just one more thing to put on top of the pile,” said David Schwartz, president of the Florida International Bankers Association. Members of the organization have reported cases of fake solicitations, offering opportunities to “jump the line” to get the vaccine sooner, he said. He has also heard reports of fake sales of vaccines. Remote operations are complicating efforts to fight a growing and evolving set of risks, he added, particularly as companies redistribute resources to manage new modes of working. That could spark an increase in near-term hiring of compliance analysts to help manage the increasing and evolving risks, Mr. Schwartz said. “They’ve reallocated some of their resources towards a lot of these operations,” he said. “But there are only so many resources to go around.” Write to Jack Hagel at jack.hagel@wsj.com Copyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Millions of U.S. consumers, looking to stretch their dollars and avoid taking on new credit-card debt during the coronavirus pandemic, flocked in recent months to “buy now, pay later” offers from financial-technology companies including Affirm Holdings Inc.,  Afterpay Ltd.  and Klarna Bank AB. In November, the cumulative number of U.S. shoppers that had opened an Afterpay account exceeded 13 million, and 7.5 million of them had made a purchase using Afterpay in the previous 12 months. Also in November, purchase volume among Afterpay’s U.S. users reached more than 1 billion Australian dollars, equivalent to more than $770 million and roughly triple the level a year earlier. (Afterpay is based in Australia and reports its figures in the local currency.) Klarna had counted 11 million total U.S. users as of October, two million of which used the Klarna app in the preceding month. The number of annually active Affirm users reached 3.9 million as of Sept. 30, up 63% from a year earlier. “You think of the Zooms of the world, for example, the delivery services of the world—some businesses were really lucky to do well during Covid, and I think we were one of those really fortunate businesses,” said David Sykes, the head of Klarna’s U.S. unit. Investors are taking notice. The price of shares in Afterpay, which trade in Australia and the U.S., has quadrupled since the start of 2020. Affirm filed paperwork last month with the Securities and Exchange Commission for an initial public offering that could value the San Francisco startup at as much as $10 billion, The Wall Street Journal previously reported. Klarna recently became one of Europe’s most valuable privately held tech companies after a fundraising round pegged the worth of the Swedish company at $10.65 billion.  "

Now, many companies are considering changing the model to avoid future product shortages and transportation delays, even if it might increase costs. Some are looking at moving production closer to home. Others are considering spreading small factories around the world instead of putting all their manufacturing in one place. There is little evidence of a big shift so far, given the costs and the uncertainty. But surveys and interviews with corporate executives show some have started to make changes and many are seriously considering them, though consultants say the moves could take several years to roll out. Their decisions could ripple through the global economy, fueling growth in some places while curbing it in others. Prices for consumer goods could rise, as companies source from more expensive places. Higher inflation and interest rates could follow. “If you go into a world of more diversified supply chains, which almost certainly will be less efficient…you could start to see inflationary pressures building,” said Shaun Roache, chief Asia-Pacific economist at S&P Global Ratings, who previously worked for the International Monetary Fund.

But it isn’t going to be soon. Rather, a widespread return probably won’t take place until the late spring or early summer of 2021 when enough people have been vaccinated in the U.S. for the population to come close to achieving “herd immunity,” according to public-health professionals and executives in the real-estate industry. Moreover, the office world that will be reinhabited next year will look a lot different from the one that was hurriedly vacated in mid-March when the fear of Covid-19 sent much of the U.S. labor force into lockdown. During an initial transition period, office density likely will be low, workers will wear masks and a range of other safety precautions will be followed. Long-term changes in the workplace will continue for years. Working from home and other remote locations, which became a necessity during the pandemic, will likely remain a major part of the workplace, employers and real-estate executives say. Businesses that are highly competitive for top talent will likely begin opening small satellite offices in metropolitan areas and offering employees the option of working there, at home or in centralized headquarters—or a combination of the three. Design firm Gensler already is working with a half dozen Fortune 100 companies on such “hub-and-spoke” strategies, as they are becoming known in the office industry, said Joseph Brancato, co-chairman of the firm.

Under the slogan #DisruptTexts, critical-theory ideologues, schoolteachers and  Twitter  agitators are purging and propagandizing against classic texts—everything from Homer to F. Scott Fitzgerald to Dr. Seuss. Their ethos holds that children shouldn’t have to read stories written in anything other than the present-day vernacular—especially those “in which racism, sexism, ableism, anti-Semitism, and other forms of hate are the norm,” as young-adult novelist Padma Venkatraman writes in School Library Journal. No author is valuable enough to spare, Ms. Venkatraman instructs: “Absolving Shakespeare of responsibility by mentioning that he lived at a time when hate-ridden sentiments prevailed, risks sending a subliminal message that academic excellence outweighs hateful rhetoric.” The subtle complexities of literature are being reduced to the crude clanking of “intersectional” power struggles. Thus Seattle English teacher Evin Shinn tweeted in 2018 that he’d “rather die” than teach “The Scarlet Letter,” unless Nathaniel Hawthorne’s novel is used to “fight against misogyny and slut-shaming.” Outsiders got a glimpse of the intensity of the #DisruptTexts campaign recently when self-described “antiracist teacher” Lorena Germán complained that many classics were written more than 70 years ago: “Think of US society before then & the values that shaped this nation afterwards. THAT is what is in those books.” Jessica Cluess, an author of young-adult fiction, shot back: “If you think Hawthorne was on the side of the judgmental Puritans . . . then you are an absolute idiot and should not have the title of educator in your twitter bio.”  "

Ultimately, Mr. Cuomo said he wants “to send a clear signal” that the state won’t tolerate attempts to subvert the process it has put in place for vaccine distribution and administration. “If you violate the law on these vaccinations, we will find out and you will be prosecuted,” he said.

Nearly 20% of U.S. counties, or more than seven million people, lack a single site that administers Covid-19 tests, according to estimates by nonprofit data-analytics group Surgo Ventures. Areas without testing sites tend to be in less affluent urban and rural counties, the data show. Although these so-called testing deserts are home to a relatively small portion of the U.S. population, health experts say their existence hinders the broad national effort to slow the virus’s spread, because many people in these areas hold public-facing front-line jobs that put them at risk of infection and unwittingly spreading the virus. The physical access issue is part of a larger problem, experts said. Beyond that, “there is also the functional access, or the barriers to access,” that are much more widespread and further limit people’s ability to get tested, said Jorge Caballero, co-founder and medical director of Coders Against Covid, a volunteer group that collects and verifies testing data through official sources like testing sites, clinics and public-health departments. The Surgo analysis is based on Coders Against Covid’s data, in collaboration with nonprofit Urban and Regional Information Systems Association’s GISCorps. Some testing sites are only accessible by car, charge for tests, or don’t test children, Dr. Caballero said, and “that’s not even touching on the other component of what happens if someone tests positive. How do they pay their bills and put food on the table?”  "

The premise of his decision is that reforming international institutions from inside is more effective than leaving or withholding funds, and this theory will be tested quickly. “China has total control over the World Health Organization,” Donald Trump said last year when announcing the U.S. would leave. That was typical hyperbole, but he had a point. WHO director-general Tedros Ghebreyesus fawned over China’s response to the virus—“very impressive, and beyond words”—as Beijing destroyed virus samples, neutralized whistleblowers, and spread conspiracy theories. WHO officials privately considered speaking out but calculated that the Chinese Communist Party would be even less cooperative if criticized publicly. The agency’s reticence didn’t do much. A team of WHO experts went to Beijing to study the origins of the virus in February 2020—when their chances of discovering how it transferred to humans from animals were significantly better than today—but the Chinese government impeded them. Negotiations with Beijing dragged on through 2020. This month Dr. Tedros finally mustered the spiritless complaint that he was “very disappointed” with the delays. The Chinese foreign ministry said it welcomed the investigators’ presence shortly before they began arriving in recent days. Take this as seriously as O.J. Simpson’s vow to make finding the killer of his ex-wife “my primary goal in life.” Media reports say Beijing pushed WHO to delegate critical initial investigatory work to Chinese scientists. The WHO team at best will get incomplete data, because research on Covid-19’s origins can’t be published in China without the Communist Party’s approval. The Chinese government also approved the WHO mission’s members and agenda.  "

He has set a target of administering 100 million doses of the vaccine during the first 100 days of his presidency. The U.S. is administering close to 1 million doses a day now, but Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told The Wall Street Journal, “We would prefer to underpromise and overdeliver.” To accelerate vaccinations, he said his administration will work with federal, state and local officials to set up thousands of community vaccination centers across the country and deploy mobile units to rural and underserved areas. Mr. Biden promised 100 federally supported centers by the end of his first month in office. The Federal Emergency Management Agency will help set them up, and the federal government will increase reimbursements to states deploying the National Guard to help with vaccinations. Mr. Biden also said he aims to increase the pace of vaccinations by making shots available at independent and chain pharmacies beginning in February. In addition, Mr. Biden has promised to make the vaccine available free of charge to all members of the public, without cost-sharing, regardless of immigration status. His administration had also planned to release nearly all available vaccine doses. The Trump administration had been holding back stock for second doses, but then decided to release them as Covid-19 cases mounted.  "

One order directs agencies to use their authority, including the Defense Production Act, to meet shortfalls in supplies such as masks, while another establishes a pandemic testing board to expand testing supply and access. Another order requires masks in airports and in certain types of public transportation such as many trains, ships, intercity buses and airplanes. Mr. Biden’s ability to pursue some of his biggest policy objectives—limiting industrial emissions, expanding health coverage and overhauling immigration laws—will depend in part on his success in combating the pandemic. On Thursday, he sought to manage expectations. “We’re in a dark winter of this pandemic,” said Mr. Biden, warning that the situation will get worse before it gets better.

Testing has been uneven across states and communities. Case counts, missing asymptomatic and mild infections, are too low. And death tallies are believed to be incomplete. According to some estimates, for every documented case of Covid-19, there are at least two undetected infections, and the unusually large number of deaths that occurred last year suggest the virus might have killed more people than the data record. By the end of 2020, nearly 346,000 deaths in the U.S had been attributed to Covid-19, according to Johns Hopkins University, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 450,000 excess deaths occurred that year.

As health departments across the country get their vaccination efforts up and running—some more successfully than others—President Biden’s administration is hoping to quicken the process. As of mid-January, there was an average of almost 900,000 people getting their first doses of the vaccine each day. This pace might change, but based on the recent rate, it might take a year—until January 2022—for every American to get at least one shot, according to data analyzed by The Wall Street Journal. The projection provides a snapshot at the current trajectory, although it is conceivable that not everyone will receive a vaccine. The projection overstates the current progress because the two vaccines currently approved for emergency use in the U.S.—one made by  Pfizer Inc.  and its partner  BioNTech SE  and the other developed by  Moderna Inc. —require two doses for full vaccination. Since mid-December, more than 14 million people—about 4% of the population—have received at least one dose as of Jan. 20, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A vaccine from  Johnson & Johnson ,  which could seek U.S. emergency-use authorization as soon as February, only requires a single dose and could shorten the projection. Moreover, the rate of vaccination has been improving, with the first three weeks of the rollout averaging about 216,000 a day.  "

Will capitalism be changed as a result? To answer the question, it is worth looking back a decade to the aftermath of the global financial crisis. Occupy Wall Street was the protest group du jour, and governments had just allocated trillions of dollars to rescue the financial system. Aside from bank reforms, capitalism (though not global trade) survived pretty much unscathed. This time might be different, because the past decade has prepared the ground for a shift to more interventionist government. The stunning shareholder returns of the past decade hang in the balance. Dominic Barton, then head of management consultants McKinsey & Co. and now Canada’s ambassador to China, summed up the view shared by many of capitalism’s winners in a 2011 article in the Harvard Business Review: “Business leaders today face a choice: We can reform capitalism, or we can let capitalism be reformed for us.” Dozens of think tanks were formed in the 2010s to allow the world’s elite to discuss how to fix capitalism, roping in the pope and Britain’s Prince Charles to speak to corporate leaders. Thousands of environmental, social and governance (ESG) funds were set up, and many old unsuccessful funds had the label slapped on them to make them more attractive. Even the Business Roundtable, the main U.S. corporate lobbying group, signed up for stakeholder capitalism, the idea of paying more attention to the needs of workers, local communities and the environment.

Eight countries outside Russia have authorized the shot for emergency use. Still, Sputnik V hasn’t been approved by Western health authorities or received authorization from the World Health Organization, which many developing countries rely on for vetting vaccines. Russia has initiated talks with the European Medicines Agency about approving the shot in the European Union and has applied for WHO authorization.  "

It is a small bright spot amid Covid-19, although the number of people saved from a flu death pales next to the number dying from the new pandemic. It also presents questions that doctors around the globe will likely be wrestling with for years: If flu can be nearly wiped out this season, why not every season? Which steps help the most to stop the flu from spreading? “This is an extremely puzzling phenomenon. We’re in a historic, unbelievable situation,” said Norio Sugaya, a pediatrician who serves on a World Health Organization influenza committee. The WHO says the measures people and governments are taking to prevent the spread of Covid-19, such as wearing masks and limiting public gatherings, have probably helped keep the flu in check. Increased flu vaccination rates may also be contributing, it says. Another hypothesis holds that the broad spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, in countries like the U.S. may play a role in blocking the flu by lifting people’s immunity against other viruses. One study in the spring of 2020 in New York City found that people testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 were far less likely to be carrying other common viruses such as influenza viruses. Still, research into that hypothesis is just beginning.  "

Beyond the blows to airlines, hotels, travel agents and rental-car companies, the drop in business travel is rippling through whole ecosystems of related commerce, including airport shops, downtown bars and restaurants, construction companies building convention stages, entertainers, taxi drivers and aircraft-parts manufacturers. Domestic and international business travelers in the U.S. directly spent $334.2 billion in 2019, supporting 2.5 million jobs, according to the U.S. Travel Association. But when considering the follow-on effects, it estimates the economic output and jobs supported by business travel were roughly double those figures before the pandemic. “When a large convention or event is happening, the entire city is involved,” said Tori Emerson Barnes, the association’s head of public affairs and policy. “The florist that provides the flowers, the dry cleaners that prepare the linens, the coffee shop that serves travelers. Whole downtown areas have been revitalized due to the meeting and events business, and they’ve really struggled this past year.” When global restrictions to control the spread of Covid-19 were put into place last spring, businesses and road-warrior workers were forced to adjust, making sales calls and attending board meetings through videoconferences rather than on-site visits, and adapting to virtual training and networking instead of conference-center seminars.

I’m capable of forming my own ideas,” the 33-year-old nurse says. “There is some mistrust of the authorities on my part, when you see how the crisis has been managed in France from the start.” France’s mass vaccination campaign is off to a glacial start, with only around 422,000 people receiving the vaccine in more than three weeks since European regulators authorized the drug, far behind most other developed nations. A big reason: French officials are running up against deeply ingrained opposition that has made France among the world’s top vaccine skeptics. An Ipsos poll conducted in December found that France ranked at the bottom of 15 countries on willingness to take a Covid-19 vaccine, with only 40% of the public saying they wanted the shot. Polls show that more than three-quarters of nursing home workers—who are among the government’s first target groups for the vaccine—don’t want to take it. The resistance has historical roots in the 19th century, when antivaccination groups campaigned against modern inoculation techniques discovered by Frenchman Louis Pasteur. In recent years, it has been fueled by widespread distrust of the government of President Emmanuel Macron, who has faced years of protests from the antiestablishment yellow-vests movement.  "

The new version is already the most common variety of the virus across most parts of the U.K., and U.S. federal authorities have said it is likely to become the dominant variant in America by March. Britain’s top scientific adviser Friday said preliminary studies show it may be between 30% to 40% deadlier than previous variants. The preliminary conclusions from the U.K., based on four separate studies, come as health authorities are expressing heightened concerns about mutations of the virus that could make it more contagious, more deadly or more resistant to vaccines. A variant discovered in South Africa has a mutation that could make current vaccines less effective at preventing it, researchers say. Another in Brazil has raised similar concerns. The emergence of such variants increases the stakes in the sometimes faltering efforts to roll out vaccines in the U.S. and across the world. The conclusions from scientists advising the British government are still tentative. U.K. hospitals are already stretched to the limits with more Covid-19 patients than at any time during the pandemic. The Covid-19 death toll in the U.K. is expected to pass 100,000 in the coming week.  "

Under a presidential proclamation released by the White House on Monday, the change would go into effect Jan. 26, the same day as new requirements announced last week that all people flying to the U.S. from abroad test negative for Covid-19 no more than three days before their flights. Restrictions on travel from China and Iran would remain in place. But Mr. Biden’s incoming White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, wrote on Twitter on Monday night that the Biden administration wouldn’t lift the travel restrictions on Jan. 26. “With the pandemic worsening, and more contagious variants emerging around the world, this is not the time to be lifting restrictions on international travel,” she wrote. “On the advice of our medical team, the Administration does not intend to lift these restrictions on 1/26.

This is a slap at Canada, and it sends a message to investors that playing by U.S. rules provides no immunity from arbitrary political whim. TC Energy  (formerly TransCanada) has been stuck in the quicksand of American politics for more than a decade. A 2004 executive order requires the State Department to approve cross-border projects. In 2008 TC applied for a permit to transport up to 830,000 barrels of crude per day from the Alberta oil sands to U.S. refineries on the Gulf Coast. The Obama State Department found five separate times that the pipeline would have no material impact on greenhouse gas emissions since crude would still be extracted. Shipping bitumen by rail or tanker would result in 28% to 42% higher CO2 emissions and more leaks. No matter. President Obama in 2015 rejected the permit as an oblation to the Paris Climate accords. President Trump gave the right of way, but legal challenges by anti-fossil fuel groups marooned the pipeline and ran out the clock on the Trump years. Now Mr. Biden is yanking Keystone’s permit and rejoining the Paris agreement. Neither action will matter to the climate. Since 2000 the U.S. has led the world in energy-related emissions reductions as natural gas from shale hydraulic fracturing has replaced coal in power production. China’s Paris commitment doesn’t require it to cut emissions for another decade. Russia’s are set to rise for years. Last November Russian oil giant Rosneft launched a massive exploration project in the Arctic. “Mineral resources will remain a competitive advantage of Russia’s economy, and will determine the place and role of the country in the world,” Russia’s strategic mineral plan says.

As efforts ramp up, here’s advice from doctors involved with the vaccine rollout on how to prepare and what to expect. Many people will register for a timed appointment, aimed at keeping wait times and the potential for crowds to a minimum—although the patchwork rollout so far has also meant many waiting in long lines. After filling out consent forms and receiving the shot, you’ll be monitored for adverse reactions for 15 or 30 minutes depending on your allergy history. In the case of a timed appointment, the entire process should take around an hour, says Julie Boom, co-chair of the Covid-19 Vaccine Task Force at Texas Children’s Hospital in Houston, which is now vaccinating eligible patients that already have records within the hospital system. Afterward, some people choose to go home and rest. In most cases, you’ll simply need your photo ID and proof of your appointment. Some places may require additional documents, such as employee badges for first responders to show they are eligible. Those getting vaccinated generally shouldn’t be asked to pay, so do ask questions if payment is requested. For now, the two vaccines available in the U.S. are found to be similarly safe and effective, says Wafaa El-Sadr, professor of epidemiology and medicine at Columbia University in New York. Eventually, choosing one vaccine over the other may come down to scheduling conflicts, she says. The second dose of the Pfizer vaccine is offered 21 days later, while Moderna is offered 28 days later. “The only thing I would consider is convenience,” says Dr. El-Sadr. No food precautions are required. Staying well hydrated prior to the vaccine is encouraged for people who tend to feel lightheaded with vaccines or blood draws, says Gregory Huhn, vaccination coordinator for Cook County Health, a hospital system in Chicago. Even if you are worried about side effects, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention doesn’t recommend taking fever-reducing drugs (known as antipyretics) before a vaccine shot. However antipyretics, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen, can be used following vaccination to treat any fever or local discomfort, the CDC says. In any public setting, there’s a possibility of being exposed to the virus. The vaccine dose received that day won’t offer additional protection, Dr. Huhn says. However, vaccine-site organizers are aware of the risks and take precautions throughout the process, which includes floor decals and furniture spaced at least six feet apart, along with strict masking and capacity limits, he says. People are asked to stay at the site to be monitored for adverse effects, including allergic reactions, though these are rare. Those experiencing any post-vaccine sensations can call over a medical professional to address concerns. The monitoring occurs “within the line of sight of our nurses,” Dr. Huhn says. In some cases, Dr. Boom notes, feelings of faintness can relate to nervousness over getting the shot rather than side effects relating directly to the vaccine. While those vaccinated are asked to stay between 15 and 30 minutes, it is possible to have an allergic reaction or worrying side effects after returning home, Dr. Huhn notes. “Anaphylaxis can occur hours after exposure,” he says. If that happens, immediately seek medical help. Adults will receive a vaccination card that includes the lot number and name of the administered vaccine along with a reminder to get their second dose. Those going for their second dose will need to bring this card with them. Your vaccination data is also recorded by the vaccine provider and stored electronically, Dr. Boom says. Later, you may need your vaccine document for work or travel purposes. While many experience no side effects at all, some younger people with more robust immune systems often have a stronger immune response to the vaccine, which can take the form of side effects including fatigue, muscle aches and soreness at the injection site. In previous research, “those over age 55 had less reactogenicity, because their immune systems aren’t as vigorous as those of younger individuals,” Dr. Huhn says. Those who have previously had Covid may also have a stronger immune response, he adds. Doctors say there is likely some protection from the first shot but, as the majority of participants in the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine trials received two doses, there isn’t yet enough data to say definitively how much protection and how long it lasts. The second dose enables the immune system to provide long-lasting protection. Doctors strongly advise getting both shots, in the recommended time frame. It takes time for your body to build protection after any vaccination, the CDC says, and the vaccines that require two shots may not protect you until a week or two after your second shot. “The protective effect begins to be observed from two weeks after the second vaccine injection,” Dr. El-Sadr says. She notes that the minimum follow-up for vaccine study participants was eight weeks and that information will evolve over time on the duration of protection. Precautions including mask-wearing and staying away from others are important even after you’ve been fully vaccinated, as the vaccines aren’t 100% effective, Dr. El-Sadr says. Late-stage trials showed Pfizer has 95% effectiveness while Moderna has 94.1%. Additionally, it is possible that even those who have been vaccinated can carry the virus without showing symptoms and pass it onto others. Research on this is still under way.

Tuesday’s findings, from a preliminary analysis of a large-scale clinical trial published in the British medical journal the Lancet, demonstrated that the two-shot vaccine was 91.6% effective in preventing symptomatic Covid-19 and offered complete protection against severe cases. There were no serious side effects, the paper said. The vaccine was also found to be similarly safe and effective in elderly people. The endorsement of Sputnik V presents a significant victory for Russian President Vladimir Putin in the global vaccination race, providing a vote of confidence in the capability of Russian science and medicine and helping to deflect some of the criticism Moscow encountered for its fast-tracked development of the vaccine and lack of published trial data. The Russian shot’s efficacy rate is almost equal to vaccines developed by  Moderna Inc.  and  Pfizer Inc.  and its German partner  BioNTech SE ,  which are around 95% effective, and outshines the vaccine produced by the British-Swedish multinational pharmaceutical company  AstraZeneca  PLC, which has published efficacy rates at between 62% to 90% in late clinical trials, with most trial results in the lower end of that range. Russia—the world’s fourth worst-hit country with nearly four million cases—has banked on Sputnik V to avoid new costly lockdowns as its economy reels from plummeting prices for its oil, a critical industry for the country. Authorities here plan to vaccinate 60% of the domestic population by the end of the year.  "

The 10 Republican senators met with Mr. Biden Monday evening to discuss their proposal, which would provide $300 a week in enhanced federal unemployment benefits through June, versus the $400 a week through September in the Biden plan. The GOP proposal also outlines $20 billion each for child care and schools—both lower than the Biden proposal—as well as $50 billion for small-business relief and $160 billion for vaccines, testing and protective equipment, according to a summary released Monday morning. The proposal omits measures favored by many Democrats, such as aid for state and local governments and a plan to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. The meeting lasted roughly two hours, and Sen. Susan Collins (R., Maine) said the two sides explained their proposals further and agreed to keep talking. Nine senators joined in person, with Sen. Mike Rounds (R., S.D.) attending remotely. “It was a very good exchange of views. I wouldn’t say that we came together on a package tonight.

The pandemic has only made them bigger. A lot bigger. In almost every facet of life—the tools we use to work, study, and play; how we shop and interact; the way companies operate and market their products—people and businesses have become more reliant on technology over the past year. Even amid one of the most punishing economic downturns on record, spending surged on computers, videogames, online retail, cloud-computing services and digital advertising. The result was dizzying growth for some of the largest corporations in history—and for their stock prices. At a time when companies such as airlines and bricks-and-mortar retailers struggled to survive, combined revenue for the five biggest U.S. tech companies— Apple Inc.,   Microsoft Corp. ,  Amazon.com Inc.,  Google-parent Alphabet Inc., and  Facebook Inc. —grew by a fifth, to $1.1 trillion. Their aggregate profit rose an even faster 24%. And their combined market capitalization soared by half over the past year to a staggering $8 trillion. Their economic sway expanded in other ways, too, including employment: Amazon alone added 500,000 new workers in a single year, roughly equivalent to the entire population of Atlanta. Lawmakers and regulators may yet find ways to rein them in, but the economic and societal forces propelling Big Tech to even higher heights seem likely to outlast Covid-19. Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella has said that he expects spending on technology to double to 10% of gross domestic product from its current level of 5%. This month he said he now expects that to happen even faster."

It wasn’t just that players and staff for the Tennessee Titans were continuing to test positive in an outbreak that shook the NFL’s season. It wasn’t even that the league was learning that the virus was able to rush through holes in its protocols. The NFL was slowly discovering something far deeper: a core tenet of Covid-19 transmission wisdom—how to define when individuals are in “close contact”—was just wrong. The safety of interactions during this global pandemic had been for months measured by a stopwatch and a tape measure. The guidance was that someone had been exposed to the virus if they had been within six feet of an infected person for more than 15 minutes. It was drilled into everyone for so long it became coronavirus gospel. But that wasn’t proving true during the NFL’s outbreaks. People were testing positive for the virus even though they had spent far less than 15 minutes or weren’t within six feet of an infectious person—and the league had the contact-tracing technology to prove it. “That was a wake-up call,” said Dr. Allen Sills, the NFL’s chief medical officer. “We had to be more precise in our definition of high-risk close contacts because clearly transmission could occur outside those basic boundaries of time and distance.”  "

Researchers are beginning human trials in which volunteers will receive an initial dose of one vaccine and a booster shot from another made by a different manufacturer. The goal is to see if such a strategy—known as heterologous prime-boost vaccination—could produce a more effective immune response against the virus that causes Covid-19 than using two shots of a single vaccine. Finding ways to bolster the body’s defenses has gained new urgency following the emergence of variants of the virus, whose vulnerability to existing shots isn’t fully understood. Researchers said the mix-and-match approach, if validated in human trials, will offer another benefit as countries race to inoculate their citizens: It might help ease pressure on vaccine supplies by giving doctors more options when patients are due for a second dose. “Knowing that you could mix different vaccine types according to supply availability could only accelerate vaccination efforts,” said Helen Fletcher, professor of immunology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.

Not all Americans are eligible for the vaccines, and shots remain in short supply. But vaccines are becoming more broadly available in some states, and the Biden administration on Tuesday announced the first phase of a federal program starting Feb. 11 that will deliver vaccines directly to retail pharmacies. There is no cost to receive the vaccine. The job of vaccinating large swaths of the population will fall largely on retail pharmacies, with companies such as  CVS Health Corp. ,  Walgreens -Boots Alliance Inc.,  Walmart Inc.  and  Kroger Co.  saying they are prepared to give tens of millions of shots a month. “We’re going to have to look at ways to increase our access points.

The jobless rate stalled at 6.7% in December and November after a rapid descent from double-digit levels last spring. A Labor Department report coming Friday will provide an update. Economists estimate business and government payrolls rose slightly in January and the jobless rate remained stuck in place. Just a year ago, the unemployment rate had fallen to 3.5%, a low not seen in decades. The Federal Reserve and the new Biden administration want to get back there as quickly as possible. Washington’s intense focus on driving unemployment much lower marks a change in policy circles and more broadly in economic thinking. The Trump administration initially set speeding up economic growth as its top goal. The Federal Reserve for decades made low and stable inflation its beacon. Previous administrations have given priority to rising homeownership, reduced poverty, low taxes, balanced budgets and other economic objectives. However, the low unemployment rate achieved before the pandemic was a wake-up call for many policy makers and economists about the merits of reducing joblessness as the primary goal. It occurred without spurring the inflation that old economic theories suggested would happen."

For months, public health authorities have been calling for rapid, easy-to-use tests for Covid-19 that can be performed anywhere, both to enable people to quickly determine whether or not they have Covid-19 and to allow for wider screening. At-home tests are expected to be less precise than those done in a lab and will likely require a follow-up test in certain situations. Ellume shipped out its first batch of 10,000 tests to the U.S. the week of Jan. 18, the company said last week. Ellume had originally aimed to ship 100,000 tests a day starting in January.  "

Instead of its 27 member states fighting for doses from a few manufacturers, the European Commission, the closest the bloc has to a government, would centralize purchases for some 450 million inhabitants, bringing prices down and ensuring that residents of rich and poor countries alike would get equal access to the best shots available. Half a year later, an acute shortage of doses is keeping the EU’s vaccination effort from taking off, making it likely that only a small portion of the general public will get a shot by the end of summer. The reasons: The EU was late in ordering vaccines compared with the U.S. and the U.K.; it bet on companies that have yet to deliver; and when delays started creeping in, it blamed the manufacturers instead of restarting negotiations. “There are about 10 hard weeks of vaccine deficiency ahead of us,” German Health Minister Jens Spahn told journalists over the weekend. “More [vaccines] could have been ordered, and faster.” Israel has vaccinated 55% of its population, the U.K. 14% and the U.S. 9.4%, against just 2.8% for the EU. At current rates, only two members, Malta and Romania, will have immunized one-third of their population by the end of the year, according to a Jan. 29 report by UBS.  "

In other words, all that conservative suppression that’s, er, not happening? We need more of it. New York University’s Stern Center for Business and Human Rights released a brief this week that is being amplified in the press entitled, “False Accusation: The Unfounded Claim that Social Media Companies Censor Conservatives.” It argues that “some conservatives believe their content is suppressed on partisan grounds when, in fact, it’s being singled out because it violates neutral platform rules.” That is sometimes true, but the report doesn’t remotely prove that it always is. What about when  Twitter  and  Facebook  tried to suppress a New York Post story about Hunter Biden before the 2020 election? Even the report concedes that “the question of whether social media companies harbor an anti-conservative bias can’t be answered conclusively.” That doesn’t stop the authors from unabashedly asserting that “the claim of anti-conservative animus is itself a form of disinformation.” It is perpetuated partly because “it appeals to the same conspiratorial mindset that has fostered the QAnon movement.”  "

The Chinese authorities turned down requests to provide such data on 174 cases of Covid-19 that they have identified from the early phase of the outbreak in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019. The investigators are part of a WHO team that this week completed a monthlong mission in China aimed at determining the origins of the pandemic. Chinese officials and scientists provided their own extensive summaries and analysis of data on the cases, said the WHO team members. They also supplied aggregated data and analysis on retrospective searches through medical records in the months before the Wuhan outbreak was identified, saying that they had found no evidence of the virus. But the WHO team wasn’t allowed to view the raw underlying data on those retrospective studies, which could allow them to conduct their own analysis on how early and how extensively the virus began to spread in China, the team members said. Member states typically provide such data—anonymized, but disaggregated so investigators can see all other relevant details on each case—as part of WHO investigations, said team members. “They showed us a couple of examples, but that’s not the same as doing all of them, which is standard epidemiological investigation,” said Dominic Dwyer, an Australian microbiologist on the WHO team. “So then, you know, the interpretation of that data becomes more limited from our point of view, although the other side might see it as being quite good.”  "

Chinese authorities performed antibody tests on about two-thirds of those patients in the past few months, according to the investigators, and said they found no trace of infection by the virus. But members of the WHO team probing the pandemic’s origins said any antibodies could have subsided to undetectable levels during the delay. “Further studies are needed,” said Peter Ben Embarek, the food-safety scientist who led the WHO team, which wrapped up a four-week visit to China on Wednesday. Team members said they urged China to conduct wider tests on blood samples collected in autumn 2019 around Hubei, the province that is home to Wuhan, to look for evidence about when the virus was first circulating. Chinese authorities said they hadn’t yet obtained necessary permissions to test samples, many of which are held in blood banks, WHO investigators said. China’s disclosures to the WHO raise questions about the possibility that Covid-19—which has now killed more than 2.3 million people—was already spreading in China as far back as October 2019 and that earlier detection could have helped contain the outbreak before it became a global pandemic. Beijing says the first patient identified in China developed symptoms on Dec. 8, 2019.  "

All that was left were pockets in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Medical experts hoped 2020 would be the last year that the main form of the virus, which can permanently paralyze or cause death, posed a threat. The coronavirus pandemic put a halt to that progress. In March, house-to-house vaccination teams working across Pakistan were forced to stop their work because of Covid-19. As a result, polio resurged, including a mutated form of the virus. It has now been detected in samples taken from sewers in 74% of Pakistan in late 2020, up from just 13% in early 2018. “Now the virus isn’t just in select pockets. The risk is everywhere” in the country, said Rana Safdar, the doctor in charge of Pakistan’s polio campaign. The decadeslong battle to eradicate polio around the world is one of the most ambitious and expensive public-health campaigns in history. The mass-vaccination drive and its progress toward arresting a malady that has disabled or killed millions of people point to the success possible in the efforts to inoculate people around the world against Covid-19."

The longer it takes to get the virus under control, the harder it may become. And soon, the problem may be a vaccine glut if demand is weaker than expected. After early challenges, vaccine delivery is keeping up with supply. But by the end of March, the monthly vaccine supply may reach 100 million doses. To keep pace, the vaccination rate would have to double and then some. This will require an all-of-the-above approach to administering vaccines, tapping substantial capacity in pharmacies, primary-care practices and other trusted health-care providers. Especially with improved delivery, at some point, perhaps in April, supply will start exceeding demand. The challenge won’t be how to ration a scarce resource, but how to reach patients reluctant to get vaccinated. Based on the latest Kaiser Family Foundation tracking surveys, more than half of Americans say they don’t want to get vaccinated. Some may simply want to wait; others may be set against getting it. One reason for the hesitancy may be that it was necessary to ration scarce doses at the start, causing many Americans to internalize the idea that some people may be more likely to benefit or more deserving than others. It is essential to emphasize in public-health messaging that every adult can benefit and deserves the protections they can provide, and there will be no reason to forgo it once the scarcity problem is solved. Government at every level should work with as many partners as possible to expand access. More Americans will take the vaccine if they can get it at a comfortable location. Not everyone will be willing or able to line up at Dodger Stadium. Insurers, pharmacies and large employers can assist public-health systems to reach people in every community.  "

The trial, which enrolled around 2,000 volunteers with a median age of 31 in South Africa, was too small and its participants too young to draw broad conclusions on the vaccine’s overall efficacy in protecting against the disease caused by the coronavirus, especially when it comes to hospitalizations or death. However, its findings contribute to concerns that a mutating virus is rendering existing Covid-19 vaccines less effective and that shots will need to be updated to protect against new virus strains. Of the 39 volunteers in the AstraZeneca trial that were found to be infected with the new South African variant, 19 had received the vaccine, while 20 had received a placebo, said Shabir Madhi, the trial’s principal investigator and dean of the medical school at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. Those numbers would imply an efficacy rate of around 10% at protecting against mild and moderate Covid-19 from the new variant, said Dr. Madhi, although he added that the data were too limited to be statistically significant. After the results were announced, South Africa’s health minister, Zweli Mkhize, said the country would temporarily halt a planned rollout of the vaccine until there was more information on the vaccine’s efficacy. The country had planned to administer a first shipment of one million doses of the vaccine to health-care workers later this month. Johnson & Johnson  and  Novavax Inc.,  whose vaccines have yet to be authorized in any country, have also found that their shots were less effective in recent human clinical trials in South Africa, compared with trials in the U.S. or the U.K. But their vaccines were still found to be 50% or more effective at preventing mild or moderate cases of Covid-19 and even more potent at shielding recipients from severe illness and hospitalization from the new strain.

But the relief programs, largely designed to last a maximum of 12 months, are set to expire in the coming months, a serious challenge for borrowers who are still out of work or are earning less than they did pre-pandemic. More than half of 2.7 million active forbearance plans are set to end for good in March, April, May or June, according to mortgage-data firm  Black Knight Inc. “The biggest concern in my eyes is the number of folks whose forbearance programs are going to end this spring,” said Ralph McLaughlin, chief economist at Haus, a home-finance startup. “Those that were hit the hardest early on and still haven’t found a job are going to be in dire straits.”  "

Though the U.K. is grappling with a new, highly contagious variant of the coronavirus, Prime Minister Boris Johnson is hopeful that a rapid vaccination drive will permit a gradual reopening of the economy in the coming months, paving the way for a consumer-driven rebound later in the year. Gross domestic product shrank 9.9% over the year as a whole, the Office for National Statistics said Friday, the largest annual decline among the Group of Seven advanced economies. France’s economy shrank 8.3% and Italy’s contracted 8.8%, according to provisional estimates. German GDP declined 5%. The U.S. shrank 3.5%. However, the data showed the U.K. economy grew at an annualized rate of 4% in the final quarter of the year, aided by government spending and a small uptick in business investment. The decline in U.K. GDP in 2020 was the largest in more than 300 years, according to Bank of England data, though the preliminary estimate is likely to be revised. BOE data shows the economy last recorded a comparable drop in 1921, when it shrank 9.7% during the depression that followed World War I. The economy last recorded a bigger contraction in 1709, when it tumbled 13% during an unusually cold winter known as the Great Frost.  "

Alabama administered 10,013 doses per 100,000 people as of Tuesday, the lowest rate among states, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Meanwhile, it had among the highest rates in the U.S. for positive coronavirus tests over the past month at 29.1%, based on data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Several factors are at play, health officials and specialists say. Alabama’s public-health system has been depleted by years of poor funding, leaving some counties with thinly staffed health departments or no department at all. Administrative and technological problems, including inadequate appointment programs and outdated software, have hobbled the effort. Alabama’s telephone hotline for vaccine appointments initially fell short, with insufficient lines to handle demand, said Dr. Karen Landers, a district medical officer for the Alabama Department of Public Health. An appointment website went live only last week. Last month, a reservation glitch resulted in people showing up for scheduled appointments at a vaccination event in the Birmingham area, only to find it was mistakenly listed and no one was there. A large portion of Alabama’s population lives in rural areas with limited health services. Since 2009, seven rural hospitals have shut down in the state,  part of a broader wave of closures driven by factors including population loss and poverty among patient populations, according to the Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services at the University of North Carolina."

Also essential, the agency said, are proper hand-washing practices, cleaning and maintaining healthy facilities, and working with health departments to use contact tracing, isolation and quarantine to reduce the risk of transmission once someone has been infected. Strictly adhering to these measures will reduce the risk of Covid-19 in schools even if transmission is high in the community, the CDC said. The timing and logistics of bringing students back to schools without Covid-19 transmission has led to sharp debates between parents pushing for reopenings and cautious school systems, as well as tense negotiations between teachers’ unions and city governments.

Their bosses want to make sure they get the shots. Meat-industry officials said vaccines now being provided to some essential workers offer the best chance of ensuring safety for employees who cut meat, standing shoulder to shoulder, for hours at a stretch each day. Vaccination rates among plant workers could determine whether the $213 billion U.S. meat sector can move beyond the crisis that has upended the industry this past year, sickening thousands of workers and killing more than 130, according to labor union estimates. Many meatpacking-plant employees remain unsure of the vaccines’ safety and effectiveness, according to company surveys, worker groups and some workers themselves. Some worry about having to provide proof of immigration status to get a shot, worker advocates said, while others who don’t speak or read English might struggle to find out where to get one. “There is no doubt that if we can get very high acceptance of the vaccine, it will be instrumental in helping us bring the pandemic under control,” said Tom Brower, senior vice president of health and safety for  Tyson Foods Inc.,  the largest U.S. meat processor by sales. The Arkansas-based company last week administered vaccines to 45 employees in a North Carolina chicken-processing plant, among the first shots offered to the hundreds of thousands of U.S. meatpacking workers. So far, meat companies have said they won’t require workers to be vaccinated. Instead, companies including Tyson,  Pilgrim’s Pride Corp. ,  Sanderson Farms Inc.,  Smithfield Foods Inc. and Perdue Farms Inc. are producing educational videos, posters and presentations to promote the shots, joining employers in other industries in taking a bigger role to share public-health information with workers. Pilgrim’s and JBS USA Holdings Inc., the country’s biggest beef processor, will offer employees cash bonuses for getting vaccinated, and about 500 have taken the shots so far, a spokeswoman said.  "

To keep up, physicians need a broader arsenal of therapies that the virus can’t easily defeat. But the Food and Drug Administration has authorized precious few treatments for Covid-19, namely Gilead’s antiviral remdesivir and monoclonal antibodies by  Regeneron Pharmaceuticals  and  Eli Lilly .  The National Institutes of Health has prioritized monoclonal antibodies—essentially manufactured copies of human antibodies—which have shown promise against other diseases, including cancer. The rub is that mutations that alter the shape of the spike protein on the surface of the virus—as variants from the U.K., Brazil and South Africa do—can deform the sites to which antibodies bind before they neutralize the virus. Developing new antibody cocktails that target new variants could become a game of Whac-A-Mole. The good news is that Gilead says remdesivir appears effective against the new strains. It is the only FDA-approved antiviral for Covid-19, and the five-day infusion treatment is limited to hospital patients. Antivirals, which stop viruses from replicating in human cells, are typically most effective early in an illness. So finding other effective antivirals, especially ones that can be prescribed to outpatients, should be a priority. Antivirals can gum up virus replication in myriad ways. Remdesivir creates a paper jam in the coronavirus’s copy machine so it can’t distribute copies of its genetic code. Scientists at the University of Texas last month published a study in the journal Molecular Cell in which they identified the key mechanism remdesivir uses to inhibit the virus’s replication. That could lead to the creation of more potent and perhaps ingestible drugs. “What if you could take just one pill and that was all you needed to do?” as study co-author Kenneth Johnson was quoted in a UT press release. “That would make a huge difference in terms of the here and now.”  "

Democrats have been debating whether to reduce those income levels, but the version headed for a Ways and Means Committee vote this week gives the full amounts to individuals with incomes up to $75,000 and married couples with incomes up to $150,000. The legislation also expands the child tax credit, broadens child-care assistance and bolsters tax credits for health insurance. It will be combined with pieces advancing through other House committees with the aim of getting through the full House later this month. Together, the measures make up President Biden’s $1.9 trillion aid plan, which Democrats are trying to push quickly through Congress. “Our nation is struggling, the virus is still not contained, and the American people are counting on Congress to meet this moment with bold, immediate action,” said Rep. Richard Neal (D., Mass.), the committee chairman whose panel will begin considering the bill on Wednesday.

The Covid-19 pandemic is largely behind us. Most of the world has been vaccinated, though we have to tamp down occasional flare-ups and people sometimes still wear masks. While we mourn the millions who died, we have entered a post-pandemic world in which most things are more or less as they were before Covid-19. Travel and trade are unrestricted; everything from dinner parties and big weddings to stadium concerts and megachurch services are being held again; and economies are booming to keep pace with pent-up demand. Then, just as suddenly as Covid-19 emerged, disease detectives discover a fresh cluster of a new, pneumonia-like illness. Testing quickly confirms that it isn’t a variant of Covid-19 but a new influenza virus that jumped—somehow, somewhere—from birds to humans. The new virus is as infectious as the one that caused Covid-19 but four times as deadly. And unlike Covid-19, but like the devastating 1918 influenza pandemic, the new virus is particularly deadly to young adults—and, in this case, also to children. A horrifying influenza pandemic isn’t the only nightmare scenario that could be worse than Covid-19. Think of the hundreds of thousands of cases of tick-borne Lyme disease in the U.S. each year. In other parts of the world, some ticks spread Ebola-like illnesses, and if these infections spread to the U.S., tick-bites could also lead to a disease with the terrifying lethality of Ebola. Or a highly drug-resistant bacterium could spread rapidly. Or a laboratory could develop an untreatable, vaccine-defying strain of a virus or bacterium and—intentionally or by accident—release it into the world. The world wasn’t ready for Covid-19. Will we be ready for the next, inevitable pandemic? To prepare, we must start by understanding that the lessons from battling Covid-19 aren’t just about Covid-19. We will fail if we learn nothing more than how to fight the last war better. Now is the time to get ready and to realize that the costs of preparedness will be dwarfed by the price of disaster. Here are six urgent steps the world must take to become far more pandemic-proof. We will have to respond rapidly to any potentially major new health threat. I suggest a goal of “7-1-7”: Every country should be able to identify any new suspected outbreak within seven days of emergence, start to investigate the event within one day and report it then, and mount an effective response—defined by clear, specific benchmarks for different pathogens—within seven days. These goals will help governments focus attention and resources. Part of the reluctance to fund health preparedness has been a lack of simple measurements of progress. One reason for the broad bipartisan support for the global battles against HIV and malaria has been the appeal, to American politicians and voters alike, of clear metrics: the numbers of people treated, bed-nets distributed, lives saved. For HIV, the goal has been what the U.N. calls “90-90-90”—ensuring that 90% of people infected with HIV know their status, getting sustained treatment to 90% of those diagnosed and suppressing the viral load of 90% of the people on treatment. This strategy has turned concrete, lifesaving outcomes into targets for global action. Meeting the 7-1-7 goal, or something like it, is essential to a safer planet, but it won’t be easy. It will require several other steps. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have learned a crucial lesson over the past two decades: The best emergency responses use everyday systems that are robust enough to scale up in an emergency. Yet efforts to strengthen such systems are often unfocused. Enhancing countries’ capacities will require substantial resources, robust technical assistance and an insistence on accountability. As noted in a recent study by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, a global-health research group at the University of Washington School of Medicine, annual funding for global health in 2019 was an estimated $41 billion (less than 20% of which came from the U.S.). Of that total, the group estimated that less than 1% was for pandemic preparedness—some $374 million. Credible estimates of the amount needed to boost preparedness (beyond current investments) in low- and middle-income countries start at $5 to 10 billion a year for the next two or three years, continuing for at least a decade. This would come in addition to funding for better research, primary healthcare and other steps essential for progress. This is serious money, but it is dwarfed by the costs of an out-of-control pandemic, as we have all painfully learned. Many countries will need technical assistance, which can be provided in part by the World Health Organization and its networks, as well as by the U.S. CDC. Such efforts could be complemented by additional regional public-health organizations. For instance, during the Covid-19 crisis, the newly created Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (a public-health agency of the African Union officially launched in 2017) has supported stronger disease-tracking and response systems, as well as a rapid expansion of sorely needed laboratory services on the continent. The European Union announced late last year a 20-fold increase in funding for the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (founded in 2004), and discussions are under way about creating similar regional disease-control centers in Southeast Asia and the Middle East. Stronger bilateral programs from the U.S., the U.K. and other wealthy countries can also help. China would be likely to follow suit and increase its own global public-health engagement. Structured well, this could be an area for U.S.-Chinese collaboration. As recent studies in the Lancet and other medical journals have noted, the Covid-19 pandemic has underscored the central importance of primary care. New infectious diseases will be able to spread widely until patients can afford to go to health centers as soon as they feel ill, clinicians are trained to diagnose and report patients with unusual conditions, and health centers can provide accessible treatments and vaccinations. Most countries haven’t invested remotely enough in primary care—including the U.S., which performs abysmally on core measures of primary-care quality. This is a major reason for the rocky U.S. rollout of Covid-19 vaccinations. But even with more money and better technical assistance, the world won’t be able to meet the 7-1-7 goal unless it is organized for success. As the lead U.N. agency for global public health, the WHO remains the indispensable anchor of such efforts. The organization has obvious limitations: It has often been underfunded, underpowered and reluctant to criticize governments. But it performs several indispensable roles: providing evidence-based public-health guidance, facilitating international collaboration, openly tracking data and helping countries to strengthen their public-health efforts. The WHO needs real reforms to meet its mission. It must be much better insulated from political and geographic considerations in the hiring and promotion of staff, as well as in its assessments of countries and recommendations to them. A stronger WHO could provide robust technical support to governments world-wide, especially through its proposed Global Strategic Preparedness Network. As the world faces 21st-century pandemics, its international public-health structures still come largely from post-World War II agreements, with newer entities often grafted awkwardly onto them. The WHO was central to global health during the Cold War era, with a prominent role for the U.S. CDC too, but new entities—including new national and regional CDCs based on the U.S. model—have reshaped the landscape of global health. The two largest new public-health groups—the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance—have a combined budget that is about twice that of the WHO. Some new philanthropies, particularly the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust, are also large and influential. The Global Fund is a major financier of programs to combat the three diseases in its title, while Gavi helps to negotiate and finance vaccines for lower-income countries. Both are international organizations that aren’t part of the U.N. and aren’t under WHO control. They receive their substantial resources from country governments, which have steadily increased their investments in the Global Fund and Gavi because of their efficiency, accountability and impressive results. But both entities were created without strong technical components (in large part to avoid alienating the WHO), and the WHO hasn’t been able to provide sufficient specialized expertise to ensure that Global Fund and Gavi programs reach their potential. These new entities have brought far more resources, energy and accountability into global health, but they haven’t substantially strengthened laboratory capacity, disease monitoring, primary care and other capacities essential to beating Covid-19 and future pandemics. By working together to strengthen early-warning systems, share data, improve rapid-response capacities and strengthen health-protection systems world-wide, we can save millions of lives and trillions of dollars. This will cost billions a year, spent by countries large and small, but that pales in comparison to the International Monetary Fund’s October 2020 estimate that Covid-19 has cost the world some $20 trillion. The next pandemic could be even deadlier—and costlier. The world needs new financial mechanisms for readiness that can administer funds efficiently, offering accountability and boosting confidence for government investments. The World Bank, the African Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank and other entities can play important roles. Most important, the Global Fund could both generate and disburse funds for national preparedness. It could offer not just money but specific benchmarks toward the 7-1-7 goal and a new, pandemic-specific structure for ownership and oversight in recipient countries, involving ministries of finance, health, agriculture and more, as well as the private sector and civil-society groups. “An eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind,” as the old saying goes. Today, failures of global cooperation worsen the spread of infectious diseases by leaving the world blind to emerging threats. But by working together—by sharing data, knowledge and resources—we can increase our shared safety and security. One neglected issue is improving laboratory safety. Some lab errors are inevitable, but we have insufficient global standards—and no global oversight—to reduce the risk of unintentional release of deadly pathogens, as may have occurred with influenza from an accidental laboratory release in the former Soviet Union in the late 1970s and is documented to have occurred with smallpox in the U.K. in 1978 and with SARS in China in 2004. Release of a biological agent could be as deadly as a nuclear war, and we need similarly vigorous systems of standards and inspections to reduce that horrifying risk. Advances in biological science have made it increasingly easy to create dangerous pathogens. A global compact to limit the number of laboratories, personnel and experiments and to more safely manage them could substantially reduce the risk. Even reaching this modest goal would be difficult: It would be expensive, require global agreement, face resistance by researchers, demand inspections and still fail to eliminate the risk of bad actors. But we urgently need it nonetheless. We must also reduce the risk of diseases spreading from animal populations to humanity. Most dangerous new pathogens emerge from human contact with animals, often because of our encroachment into traditional habitats. A global, enforceable compact, as proposed by Vanda Felbab-Brown of the Brookings Institution and others, would help to end the commercial sale of wild animals for food. In parts of Africa and Asia where bush meat is important to nutrition, we will also need economic measures that make it easier to substitute other locally available sources of protein, and much stronger programs are needed to reduce the risk of influenza spreading from birds and swine to people. What’s the biggest lesson you think public officials should draw from the pandemic? Join the conversation below. Finally, the world must increase its manufacturing capacity for diagnostics, treatments and vaccines. Pathogens spread, so we cannot leave millions without access to the top-quality diagnosis, treatment and vaccines we want for ourselves. The Rand Corp. has warned of the dangers of “vaccine nationalism,” in which “countries push to get first access to a supply of vaccines, potentially hoarding key components for vaccine production.” Such short-sighted behavior is both ethically indefensible and politically inevitable. One solution would be to increase manufacturing by countries with relatively small populations, which would be able to vaccinate their own populations without having much impact on the overall supply. The world could also work to boost manufacturing capacity through companies that accept global financing in exchange for their agreement to produce reasonably priced products that meet stringent standards and to distribute them in underserved regions. Exciting new technologies such as mRNA—which made possible the first two Covid-19 vaccines licensed in the U.S.—raise the promise of platforms that can be rapidly repurposed to tackle new threats. Globally supported mRNA production facilities could help end the current pandemic and, potentially, produce lifesaving vaccines and medicines that would create a sustainable business model, with sales to public and private purchasers between pandemics. But more than all this, we need a new global attitude. We must act now: 2021 is the now-or-never moment to improve global resilience in facing future pandemics. We can’t know the character or the timing of the threats ahead, but they are inevitable. There is no time to lose in making preparations. Public-health decisions are unavoidably political. Failing to act, in the face of Covid-19’s proof that the world is dangerously vulnerable, would also be a decision. This year, when the urgency of such work is so clear, we must make significant investments to protect and expand global health—or we and our children will face the dire consequences. —Dr. Frieden was the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 2009 to 2017.

Andrew Cuomo was awarded an Emmy for “his leadership during the Covid-19 pandemic and his masterful use of TV to inform and calm people around the world.” Turns out the Emmys had the right actor—but the wrong performance. Increasingly it looks like Mr. Cuomo’s real act was to keep people from finding out how many people in his state’s nursing homes died from Covid-19. On Thursday the New York Post reported that Melissa DeRosa, the Governor’s top aide, admitted to Democratic leaders that the state had deliberately kept the true numbers from them. In a Wednesday conference call, Ms. DeRosa told Democrats the Cuomo administration rejected a legislative request for the figures last August because Donald Trump was tweeting that “we killed everyone in nursing homes” and was directing “the Department of Justice to do an investigation into us.” As Ms. DeRosa put it, “Basically, we froze.” The administration wasn’t sure, she said, if any information it released to state lawmakers or the Department of Justice “was going to be used against us” or “if there was going to be an investigation.” Nursing home deaths are a sensitive issue for Mr. Cuomo because of a March 25 health department directive that barred these homes from rejecting people because they had Covid-19. The Associated Press reports that 9,056 recovering patients were sent into nursing homes after the directive, more than 40% higher than what the state had previously reported. In January state Attorney General Letitia James released a report on an investigation into complaints about how the nursing homes handled Covid-19. Two findings stand out. First, that “a larger number of nursing home residents died from COVID-19 than” the official data reflected. Second, that the March 25 directive “requiring the admission of COVID-19 patients into nursing homes may have put residents at increased risk of harm in some facilities and may have obscured the data available to assess that risk.”  "

Whether it’s prudent, if acquittal appears likely, is a related question. But wherever you come down on those issues, the House impeachment managers this week are laying out a visceral case that the Capitol riot of Jan. 6 was a disgrace for which President Trump bears responsibility. Long before November, Mr. Trump was saying that the only way he could lose the election was if it were rigged. On the night of the vote, he tweeted, “they are trying to STEAL the election.” In his speech that night, he called it “a fraud on the American public,” and said, “frankly we did win.” Is it a surprise that some of his fans took his words to heart? Instead of bowing to dozens of court defeats, Mr. Trump escalated. He falsely claimed that Vice President Mike Pence, if only he had the courage, could reject electoral votes and stop Democrats from hijacking democracy. He called his supporters to attend a rally on Jan. 6, when Congress would do the counting. “Be there, will be wild!” Mr. Trump tweeted. His speech that day was timed to coincide with the action in the Capitol, and then he directed the crowd down Pennsylvania Avenue. Mr. Trump’s defenders point out that he also told the audience to make their voices heard “peacefully.” And contra            Rep. Eric Swalwell,      who argued the incitement to attack the Capitol was “premeditated,” it’s difficult to think Mr. Trump ever envisioned what followed: that instead of merely making a boisterous display, the crowd would riot, assault the police, invade the building, send lawmakers fleeing with gas masks, trash legislative offices, and leave in its wake a dead Capitol officer. But talk about playing with fire. Mr. Trump told an apocalyptic fable in which American democracy might end on Jan. 6, and some people who believed him acted like it. Once the riot began, Mr. Trump took hours to say anything, a delay his defenders have not satisfactorily explained. Even then he equivocated. Imagine,            Rep. Joe Neguse      said, if Mr. Trump “had simply gone onto TV, just logged on to            Twitter      and said ‘Stop the Attack,’ if he had done so with even half as much force as he said ‘Stop the Steal.’” The impeachment managers hurt their case by blaming only Mr. Trump for earlier clashes. “      Donald Trump,            over many months, cultivated violence,” said            Stacey Plaskett,      the delegate for the Virgin Islands. But often those events were showdowns between left and right, with both seeking trouble. “When darkness fell,” the Washington Post reported after one melee, “the counterprotesters triggered more mayhem as they harassed Trump’s advocates, stealing red hats and flags and lighting them on fire.” Yet there’s no defense for Mr. Trump’s conduct on Jan. 6 and before.            Mitch McConnell      is reportedly telling his GOP colleagues that the decision to convict or acquit is a vote of conscience, and that’s appropriate. After the Electoral College voted on Dec. 14, Mr. Trump could have conceded defeat and touted his accomplishments. Now his legacy will be forever stained by this violence, and by his betrayal of his supporters in refusing to tell them the truth. Whatever the result of the impeachment trial, Republicans should remember the betrayal if Mr. Trump decides to run again in 2024. Copyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

But it also helped a few come true. Laurie Beijen’s family had long wanted to move from San Francisco to Spain for a year. Her husband had been able to do it twice as a child, thanks to the sabbaticals his professor father took, and he wanted his kids to have a similar formative experience. “We never figured out how we could make it work,” said Ms. Beijen, 46, who manages rental properties. Last fall, with Ms. Beijen and her husband both working remotely and their kids, 11 and 9, in school two days a week, an ambitious plan emerged. “We were like, we can either sit here and have Groundhog Day every day, like we’ve been doing for the past several months,” Ms. Beijen said, “or we can do something with this time and really kind of make it matter.” It took a few months to assemble their visa paperwork (“like the biggest term paper I’ve ever done,” she said). They submitted it the day before Thanksgiving, received approval in January and departed a few days later. Now they’re living in a small town outside of Valencia, in southeastern Spain. The modernized farmhouse the family rented is surrounded by orange and avocado trees; on weekends they visit nearby beaches and castles. The kids attend a private British school nearby—in person, five days a week. “So far so good,” Ms. Beijen said. The Department of State estimates that some 9 million U.S. citizens live outside of the country. When Covid-19 closed borders and triggered restrictions around the world, thousands of them returned home—even diplomats, as some 6,000 were evacuated with their families. But other Americans are bucking the trend, leaving the U.S. to live overseas for anywhere from a few months to indefinitely. A number of hotels and resorts have been capitalizing on the appeal of extended stays, offering discounts and upgrades for bookings that are over 14 days or a month. Luxury travel company Embark Beyond launched an Embark Longer program, which offers discounts and amenities such as unlimited laundry service for resort and villa stays upward of a month. “We have clients staying several months in places like St. Barts and even Ireland,” said Jack Ezon founder of Embark Beyond. And several countries are offering special streamlined visa programs that allow foreigners to work legally for several months or a year (see “Stay Awhile” below).  "

Yet we wonder how much public support there’d be if Americans understood that most of the blowout is a list of longtime Democratic spending priorities flying under the false flag of Covid-19 relief. Let’s dig into the various House committee bills to separate the Covid from the chaff. The Covid cash includes some $75 billion for vaccinations, treatments, testing and medical supplies. There’s also $19 billion for “public health,” primarily for state health departments and community health centers. One might even count the $6 billion to the Indian Health Service, or $4 billion for mental health. The package also hands more to businesses and individuals most hit by lockdowns. That includes $7.2 billion more for the Paycheck Protection Program, $15 billion for economic injury disaster loans, $26 billion for restaurants, bars and live venues, and $15 billion in payroll support for airlines. The recipients of this taxpayer money will at least be required to prove economic harm, and in some cases repay loans. Not so the recipients of the $413 billion in checks Democrats intend to send to households far and wide, at $1,400 per man, woman and dependent, that begins phasing out at $75,000 of individual income. The Congressional Budget Office says the bill’s unemployment provisions will increase deficits by $246 billion, and that its $400 a week in federal “enhanced” unemployment benefits through August “could increase the unemployment rate as well as decrease labor force participation.” So much for economic stimulus. All told, this generous definition of Covid-related provisions tallies some $825 billion. The rest of the bill—more than $1 trillion—is a combination of bailouts for Democratic constituencies, expansions of progressive programs, pork, and unrelated policy changes.  "

The U.K. government recently announced it will consider whether Britons will need proof of vaccination or a negative Covid-19 test to visit bars, return to the office or attend theaters and sporting events. In Israel, a vaccine passport was launched last week allowing those who are inoculated to go to hotels and gyms. Saudi Arabia now issues an app-based health passport for those inoculated, while Iceland’s government is doling out vaccine passports to facilitate foreign travel. Last month, President Biden issued executive orders asking government agencies to assess the feasibility of creating digital Covid-19 vaccination certificates. Proponents of the plans say they will enable battered economies to reopen, even as vaccines are still being rolled out, allowing people to enjoy leisure activities and go to work safe in the knowledge they aren’t harming others or at risk themselves. It could also act as an incentive for people to get the shot. But the concept is potentially fraught with pitfalls. It could discriminate against minority communities, who are less likely to accept the vaccines, according to national surveys, or young people, who are less likely to be given priority to receive them. There are questions about the ethics of granting businesses access to peoples’ health records.

Nearly a year ago, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic. “We have been fighting this pandemic for so long. We have to resist becoming numb to the sorrow. We have to resist viewing each life as a statistic,” Mr. Biden said, as he referenced the grief he felt after the deaths of his wife, daughter and son. “That black hole in your chest, you feel like you’re being sucked into it.

Now, with vaccine rollouts delayed in some places and new virus strains appearing, it is looking more likely that international travel could be stalled for years. After declaring that 2020 was the worst year for tourism on record, with one billion fewer international arrivals, the United Nations World Tourism Organization says prospects for a 2021 rebound have worsened. In October, 79% of experts polled by the agency believed a 2021 rebound was possible. Only 50% said they believed that in January, and some 41% didn’t think travel would reach pre-pandemic levels until 2024 or beyond. James Sowane, who owns a transportation company catering to tourists in Fiji, called a staff meeting earlier this month and told employees to start looking for other jobs. He recently took advantage of a government-assistance program and had brought back some laid-off workers, optimistic that vaccines could spark a travel rebound as early as April. But now Mr. Sowane doesn’t think tourists will return until next year, and he and his wife can’t afford to keep paying wages at their company, Pacific Destinations Fiji.

The putative patient zero met the WHO investigators during their recent four-week visit to Wuhan, and told them that his parents had visited another local community food market, according to three team members.

The research, while preliminary, found that the previously infected people generated protection against the disease quickly and at dramatically higher levels after a first shot of the current two-shot regimens when compared with people who were vaccinated but hadn’t been sick. “Everyone should get vaccinated. Not everybody needs two shots,” said Viviana Simon, a professor of microbiology at New York’s Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and an author on one study. “As long as we can’t deliver as much vaccine to everybody who wants it, I think it’s an important consideration.” The research, which has been posted on preprint servers but not peer-reviewed or published in a scientific journal, comes as other findings into the two-shot regimen to healthy members of the general population highlight immune benefits after the first injection. On Friday, researchers in Israel reported a single shot of the vaccine from  Pfizer Inc.  and  BioNTech SE  is 85% effective in preventing symptomatic disease 15 to 28 days after being administered. Late-stage clinical trials of two-dose vaccines by Pfizer and BioNTech, as well as  Moderna Inc.,  have shown their shots to be safe and highly protective against Covid-19 when given through two doses spaced several weeks apart. However, Pfizer’s trial excluded individuals with symptomatic Covid-19, and Moderna’s left out people with a previously known infection, prompting researchers to see how immune systems in people previously sick responded.

Its intensive-care units were often filled to or near capacity in 2020. And while doctors throughout the health system rushed to find ways to care for the wave of sick patients infected by the new virus, many of the medical and support staff were being sent home to work remotely. The information-technology team led by Mayo Clinic Chief Information Officer Cris Ross faced immense challenges. Practically overnight, remote, secure and fast access to multiple systems had to be provided to thousands of workers, including doctors. The influx of Covid patients, meanwhile, needed to be able to communicate with the outside world while being kept in isolation. And it all had to be done on the fly. Adapting the healthcare system’s networks and building new tools to meet these demands required planning, decisions and execution at speeds undreamed of a short time before. Mr. Ross spoke to The Wall Street Journal about his IT department’s efforts to support Mayo’s staff and how the pandemic is changing the way his team provides IT to the organization. Here are edited excerpts of the discussion. WSJ: What was the biggest lesson you learned? MR. ROSS: Sometimes we have an expectation that if we’re going to make a change, it’s going to take months and months—that we have to step slowly and carefully. But with the pandemic, we were forced to make decisions in weeks or days. We’ve discovered that when necessity requires rapid decisions and fast action, we can do it.  "

Now, as a global recovery gathers pace, trade will likely keep growing, say policy makers, business executives and economists. But it will be hampered by the growing difficulties factories face in meeting Western consumers’ appetite for goods. Last April, as large parts of the global economy were in a deep freeze, economists at the World Trade Organization said global trade flows could suffer the largest peacetime decline since the Great Depression, possibly falling by as much as a third. Instead, global trade flows fell just 5.3% last year, according to new data from the CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis, after having returned to pre-pandemic levels by November. That recovery required less than half the time it took flows to return to their previous level following the global financial crisis. Demand for personal protection equipment, including face masks, soared. Working and schooling from home boosted demand for computers. Efforts to avoid risky public transport systems in cities boosted demand for bicycles. Many splashed out on new kitchens and furnishings. Huge government stimulus in wealthy countries has only turbocharged such demand.  "

For decades, the small biotech had tried to develop an approved vaccine, with no success. The company had enough cash to survive only another six months or so and its shares traded under $4, with a market value of $127 million. Today, Novavax is advancing toward authorization of a Covid-19 vaccine. Scientists believe that, if cleared, it could be one of the more powerful weapons against the pandemic, offering key possible advantages over its competitors. Some early data suggest the Novavax shot may be one of the first shown to stem asymptomatic spread of the coronavirus and also potentially provide longer-lasting protection. If the two-shot regimen is authorized, Novavax will still face the challenge of making and distributing it in large quantities. The firm sold some manufacturing assets in 2019 when it was desperate for cash. Investors, who left the 33-year-old company for dead last year, are betting that regulators will authorize Novavax’s vaccine in the next couple of months. They have sent shares on Nasdaq up to $229, up 106% so far this year. Late last month, Novavax released preliminary data indicating its shot was effective at protecting against Covid-19, though less so against a new strain identified in South Africa that appears to be a challenge for other shots, too. Results of the vaccine’s late-stage U.S. trial could be released late next month. Novavax now has a market value of $15.4 billion, greater than that of companies with billions of dollars of annual sales, including generic drug giant             Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. An authorization would reinforce just how much Covid has upended the pharmaceutical world. The most advanced vaccines have been introduced by newcomers to the vaccine market using previously unproven technologies that can be designed and manufactured more quickly than conventional options. While vaccine giant             Merck       & Co. recently shut down its Covid-19 vaccine effort after disappointing results, upstarts like             Moderna Inc.       and             BioNTech SE       quickly developed, tested and manufactured shots currently going into arms around the world. Novavax’s vaccine “looks as strong as any vaccine, and it may have better durability,” says John Moore, an immunologist at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York. Initially skeptical of Novavax and its shot, Dr. Moore said he grew so encouraged by early study data last year that he volunteered to be a study subject and purchased some shares in the company, which he has since sold. Much is riding on Novavax’s success. Rollouts of shots from             Pfizer Inc.       and partner BioNTech, Moderna, and             AstraZeneca       PLC have been slower than anticipated. The companies have struggled to meet huge demand. Novavax says it could produce a couple billion doses over the next year, beginning around April, equal to or more than those expected from other companies. Last week, Novavax announced a deal with Geneva-based public-health institution GAVI to allocate doses around the globe. “I admire their tenacity, their persistence, their never-say-die approach,” says             Roger Pomerantz,       an infectious-disease and vaccine veteran who is chief executive of biotech ContraFect Corp. and a former executive at Merck, which several years ago passed on working with Novavax. “But at the end of the day, you need to see vaccines.” Unlike shots from Pfizer and Moderna, the two authorized in the U.S., Novavax’s vaccine doesn’t need to be kept at freezing temperatures. That’s an advantage for hospitals, clinics and pharmacies lacking freezer capacity. While Novavax has developed some proprietary methods, its vaccine approach is similar to those of proven vaccines, such as those for shingles and hepatitis B—one reason why some scientists are fans. The Pfizer and Moderna shots are based on a newer technology that delivers genetic code through molecules known as messenger RNA, instructing the body to create the coronavirus’s signature spike protein, which elicits an immune response. AstraZeneca’s vaccine, based on a different technology and authorized for use in Europe and the U.K., delivers a harmless chimpanzee virus carrying similar directions. Novavax’s vaccine injects a synthesized, slightly modified version of the spike protein, rather than instructing the body to create it. The company’s scientists first take a common insect virus, called a baculovirus, and insert DNA instructions to create the spike protein. They use the newly infused baculovirus to infect cells that originally came from an armyworm insect. The cells are grown in large bioreactors holding up to 6,000 liters of liquid—vats that look like they come from breweries—where the spike protein is produced. The protein is isolated, purified and injected into people as a vaccine, along with a compound, called an adjuvant, that jump-starts an immune response and renders the vaccine more effective. Traditional vaccines use the actual virus to generate an immune response. Novavax's relies on a synthesized version of the coronavirus's outer spike proteins, which are what antibodies use to recognize the virus. Scientists make the protein by genetically modifying an unrelated insect virus, a baculovirus, and then using that modified virus to infect cells cloned from the armyworm insect. Coronavirus spike protein Baculovirus Modified virus The vaccine is made from a stabilized form of the coronavirus spike protein, which is anchored in a lipid nanoparticle and then injected into the body. The purified protein antigens in the vaccine can't replicate and can't cause Covid-19. The vaccine also contains a compound that enhances desired immune system responses to the vaccine.

Vaccine-generated antibody response Sources: National Institutes of Health, the company Alberto Cervantes/THE WALL STREET JOURNAL Novavax’s bumpy history shadows its efforts. Sixteen years ago, its lead product was a cream for postmenopausal women dealing with hot flashes. It wasn’t selling. Facing bankruptcy, the company turned to             Gale Smith,       now 71, a molecular biologist who was running its small vaccine group. As a graduate student, Dr. Smith had helped invent the approach of using baculoviruses to shuttle the DNA of an infectious agent into insect cells to create vaccines, a method that today is used for a flu vaccine and another for human papillomavirus, or HPV. For the next decade or so, the company employed Dr. Smith’s approach to develop vaccines for HIV, SARS, swine flu, Ebola, Middle East respiratory syndrome and more. Each time, Novavax achieved promising early results and gained backing from government bodies and nonprofits, including the Gates Foundation. Ultimately, either the shots failed in further testing or the epidemics ebbed, reducing the need for a vaccine. Executives tried to lift staffers’ spirits amid the disappointments. Most Fridays, Chief Executive Stanley Erck, a 72-year-old Vietnam War veteran, led employees to a nearby bowling alley, where they competed over pizza and beer.             Gregory Glenn,       a pediatrician who runs research and development, tried to persuade employees to stick around. “Where else can you do something noble, interesting and get paid for it?” he says he told researchers. Senior executives and others began quitting, weighing on Dr. Glenn. Driving home one night a few years ago, he broke down crying, he says. “I felt I let them down and had been overly enthusiastic,” he says. In 2014, Novavax purchased a Swedish company that produced an adjuvant, derived from the bark of a Chilean tree, to boost the immune response generated by a vaccine. Using the adjuvant, Novavax began working on shots to protect against respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, which causes the hospitalization of about 58,000 young children a year in the U.S. and can be deadly. In 2015, the stock doubled as Mr. Erck said the vaccine had the potential to be “the largest selling vaccine in the history of vaccines in terms of revenue.” “I’m a biotech CEO, I admit to being an optimist,” Mr. Erck says. The next year, the vaccine failed in late-stage, or Phase 3, trials. The morning after the 2016 presidential election, about one-third of staffers were greeted by messages they were being laid off, due to the RSV failure. “It was a huge surprise, a sad and gloomy day. People were crushed,” says Kwanho Roh, a cell biologist who survived the layoffs but saw a third of his team let go before he left the company. By 2019, after another RSV trial failed, Novavax had cemented a reputation as the little company that couldn’t. When Mr. Erck spoke at industry conferences, sometimes as few as three people came to hear him, he says. In May of that year, with the stock at 36 cents a share and in danger of getting tossed off the Nasdaq market, Novavax did a 1-for-20 reverse stock split. It finished 2019 down another 39%. In late 2019, Nasdaq removed Novavax’s shares from its biotechnology index, but Dr. Smith was sure his team was making further progress tweaking their vaccine. As 2020 began, Novavax was conducting late-stage trials on yet another vaccine, this time for flu. The company was also exploring options to advance its RSV vaccine, which has shown efficacy, including holding discussions with regulators and potential commercial partners. Early data on the flu vaccine was impressive but staffers fretted about the dwindling cash. Mr. Erck knew it was his company’s final chance, and that some employees already had one foot out the door. When the pandemic hit, executives made a difficult decision to shift to a Covid-19 vaccine, risking delays in their flu efforts. They had done work on earlier coronaviruses, so they figured they had a chance at success. In January, Novavax ordered the gene for the spike protein from a supplier with an office in Shanghai, but it never came—flights from China had been frozen. After a few days, the supplier’s New Jersey office agreed to produce the gene and drive the red-capped vial overnight to Novavax’s offices outside Washington, D.C. Weeks later, they used their baculovirus method to create a vaccine that needed to be tested in trials. However, Novavax didn’t have the cash to make the shots in bulk. In March, Mr. Erck joined other pharmaceutical executives in a meeting at the White House to discuss Covid-19 vaccines. He was blunt about Novavax’s challenges. “Frankly, we need money,” he told President Trump, according to a transcript of the conversation. Novavax lined up about $2 billion in combined funding from Operation Warp Speed, the U.S. government’s initiative to speed development of Covid-19 vaccines, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, a Norway-based nonprofit. Novavax raised additional money from a big hedge fund. To test the vaccine, Dr. Glenn called researchers at the University of Oklahoma, who offered 15 baboons bred for medical research. The subsequent trial, along with other animal studies and early human trials, demonstrated enough efficacy to stir buzz in the industry. In October, the company pushed back the start of its late-stage U.S. trial, falling further behind rivals, due to the complexities of manufacturing the shots. How do you think the pandemic will change the pharmaceutical world? Join the conversation below. On Jan. 28, Novavax said an interim analysis from a Phase 3 study showed its vaccine was 89% effective at protecting people from the disease in the U.K., where a worrisome strain of the coronavirus has been circulating. The vaccine was just 49% effective overall in a separate, middle-stage study in South Africa, where another variant is spreading, though the figure was 60% among those who weren’t HIV-positive. Like other Covid-19 vaccine makers, Novavax is reformulating its shots to better handle the new virus strains. Larry Corey,       an infectious-disease specialist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center who helped set up the federally funded trials of several of the Covid-19 vaccines, says Novavax’s vaccine has several potential advantages, including a relatively low dose level that should support mass production and enable supplies to be stretched out. “Its global applicability and potential are very high,” Dr. Corey says. Analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein say if Novavax’s is cleared, it could generate revenues of $5 billion this year. But Novavax executives, more aware than most that vaccines often fail in late trials, aren’t ready to celebrate. Investors have bet against nearly 10% of Novavax shares, a sign of their lingering doubts. By comparison, stocks in the S&P 500 have an average short-rate—a measure of shares sold short as a percentage of those outstanding—of 2.5%. Results of the large U.S.-based trial could be available by late March. Mr. Erck says he is nervous but optimistic. Others close to him remain on edge. His wife, Dr. Sarah Frech, has recently been rubbing a favorite doll, something she does to bring good luck. “She’s more superstitious than I am,” he says.

Beginning in the 1930s, federal officials enrolled hundreds of Black men in Tuskegee in an experiment to examine the effects of untreated syphilis. The men were told they were being treated for “bad blood,” according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In fact, the infected were left to suffer and die from syphilis, decades after treatment existed. Chris Pernell, a physician conducting nationwide outreach regarding Covid-19 vaccines, said the legacy of the Tuskegee study has made many Black people wary of the shots. As officials race to get shots into arms, inoculation rates in Black communities have fallen behind. At Tuskegee’s farmers market on a recent morning, David Banks said he won’t get the shot because he doesn’t trust those administering it. The 67-year-old said some neighbors have said they suspect the first dose of a two-shot regimen is used to infect a person, and the second to see if they are cured. “It’s cynical,” he said. “But like I said, they have reason to be.”"

The measure passed early Saturday largely along party lines, 219-212, with two Democrats joining all Republicans in opposition. Lawmakers will likely alter the legislation before passing it in the Senate, meaning the House will then need to approve the amended bill before sending it to the president’s desk. Democrats are racing to finish the package before March 14, when certain types of federal unemployment assistance are set to expire. The relief plan would enhance and extend federal unemployment benefits, provide $350 billion to state and local governments, send a $1,400 check to many Americans and fund vaccine distribution, among other measures. Congress has passed a series of relief measures since the pandemic’s beginning, and Democrats say the latest package will help support the country’s return to normalcy. “This bill meets the moment, meets the challenge, and we think it’s a great victory for the American people and will get us finally out of this terrible crisis we’ve been facing,” said Rep.

One is a piece of paper and the other a rubber band. If you squeeze your hands together hard and let go, the paper will remain crumpled, but the rubber band will return to its original shape. Economists tend to think of the economy as the rubber band. After a shock, they expect it to go back to normal. When it doesn’t, like the crumpled paper, they call the effect “hysteresis”—lasting changes caused by some large perturbation. The Covid-19 pandemic is a classic example. What permanent damage to the economy will it leave behind? The first place to look is in classrooms, say Eric Hanushek and Margaret Raymond, economists and education researchers at Stanford University. Lost study time for children during the pandemic has the potential to do lasting harm not just to their own long-term prospects but to American prosperity in general, say the married couple. Ms. Raymond studied 18 states and Washington, D.C. and concluded that, on average, children lost 116 days of reading time during the early stages of the pandemic last year and 215 days of math work—instruction that will be hard to regain and could leave a whole generation of children struggling to keep up in their studies and testing. If your child misses out on learning fractions now, how will she perform in algebra later? And the shock has been distributed unevenly. Children in rural areas and areas with large Black and Hispanic populations were hit the hardest. Among the states suffering the most are South Carolina and Illinois, according to Ms. Raymond’s study.  "

NBA, NFL and Major League Baseball officials say a significant percentage of players—perhaps even a majority in some leagues—have expressed concerns about taking the vaccine when it becomes available to them. The benefits of the Covid-19 vaccines are clear. Both shots that were authorized for emergency use were shown to be very safe and highly effective in large clinical trials. But the mistrust in the Black community of a healthcare system that has discriminated against them is contributing to many athletes’ uneasiness about receiving vaccines that were developed in record time. That indecision could have ramifications for the entire country’s rollout—and the immediate future of sports. NBA and MLB players are likely to become eligible during their seasons, and NFL players might be able to get the shots as they report to training camp, but the leagues have already begun education campaigns to persuade them to take the vaccines when it’s their turn. The NBA organized Zoom team meetings with the league’s medical director, a Black doctor who debunks common vaccine myths in his presentations, while their union’s consulting epidemiologist is another source of reliable information as players make up their minds.

Among both unvaccinated Hispanics and whites, 11% under 40 said they definitely won’t get the vaccine, compared with 24% of unvaccinated Black young adults. The survey of 80,000 people, conducted between Jan. 20 and Feb. 1, gauges national responses by different demographic groups in a quick turnaround period to show how the coronavirus pandemic is affecting Americans’ daily lives.

Overall, more Black adults are willing to be inoculated, compared with previous weeks’ results. In the latest poll, 70% of Black adults who haven’t received the vaccine said they definitely or probably would get it, an increase of 7 percentage points since the survey conducted the week of Jan. 6.

These deaths skew younger among minorities, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of death-certificate data collected by federal authorities.

They’re botching the recovery. After carrying out an orderly retreat from assembly lines as the pandemic arrived in the U.S., many manufacturers pulled out the playbook they followed in past recessions, cutting costs and preserving cash. That left them unprepared for the sharp rebound in consumer demand that began just weeks later and never let up. Without restaurants to visit and trips to take, Americans bought out stocks of cars, appliances, furniture and power tools. Manufacturers have been trying to catch up ever since. Nearly a year since initial coronavirus lockdowns in the U.S., barbells, kitchen mixers, mattresses and webcams are still hard to find. A global shortage of semiconductors has forced many car makers to cut production in recent weeks. “Everyone was caught flat-footed,” said Jack Springer, chief executive officer of Malibu Boats Inc. The boating industry was preparing for a downturn but instead sales jumped, he said. Malibu’s orders were up by more than half last June from a year earlier and sales of recreational boats in the U.S. in 2020 were the highest in 13 years, according to the National Marine Manufacturers Association, a trade group."

It’s going to be more gradual.” Mr. Bernstein defended the president’s $1.9 trillion stimulus plan against critics who say it risks overheating the economy and generating inflation. He acknowledged that rising inflation is a potential risk, but that a weak recovery that leads to scarring for households and businesses—such as long-term unemployment, foreclosures and bankruptcies—would do more harm. “There is room for more heat,” he said, pointing to data on weekly claims for unemployment benefits, which came to 861,000 in the most recent report, and elevated jobless rates in minority communities as evidence of spare capacity in the economy. Mr. Bernstein pointed to comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who said Tuesday that he doesn’t expect a temporary burst of federal spending to cause a large or persistent rise in inflation.

For now, you’re unlikely to have much of a choice. Medical experts say it’s important to take whichever vaccine is offered to you, and the Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines that are currently authorized in the U.S. have all been shown to be effective at preventing disease. As vaccine supply increases and more options become available in the coming months and years, there may be more scope for doctors to recommend  different types of shots for different populations. Currently, there is a little bit of wiggle room for people who are determined to get one vaccine over another. People who have registered for vaccination can try to call vaccine sites directly to find out which shots they have. But many places don’t inform people far ahead of time about which vaccine they will get during the appointment. In the early stages of the rollout,  Pfizer ’s  vaccine was more likely to be offered in hospitals, medical centers or large vaccine sites that have the ultracold storage that it was initially believed to need. Moderna’s shots, by contrast, have had less-extreme cold-storage requirements, making them more accessible for smaller pharmacies or offices in addition to larger venues. But a recent study indicated that Pfizer’s vaccine can be stored and transported at temperatures similar to what a consumer freezer provides. Now that the FDA has authorized the Johnson & Johnson vaccine too, it’s also likely to help serve areas without access to high-grade cold storage, says Kathleen Neuzil, director of the Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.

This apparently is prehistoric thinking. “The last thing we need is Neanderthal thinking,” Mr. Biden said Wednesday after            Texas Gov. Greg Abbott      lifted his statewide mask mandate and restrictions on businesses. Democrats are applauding Mr. Biden, but imagine if      Donald Trump            had attacked            Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s      lockdown as “Neanderthal thinking.” Vaccination rates in Texas and other states have been increasing while hospitalizations are plunging. About one in five adults in Texas has received at least one dose of the            Pfizer      or Moderna vaccine. Most are seniors and people with health conditions who are at highest risk of severe illness. Hospitalizations in Texas have fallen more than 60% since a mid-January peak. Politicians created a box canyon with lockdowns last spring that were originally intended to “flatten the curve.” But then every time governors loosened restrictions and cases ticked up, Democrats would demand lockdowns. Not that lockdowns (or mask mandates) much helped California or New York, which experienced bigger surges this winter than Florida did with neither. Vaccines were supposed to enable Americans more or less to get back to their before-Covid lives—youth sports, eating out, family gatherings, and even walking outside without a mask. It’s probably still prudent to wear masks in public settings indoors for a few more months, and businesses like            Starbucks      and            Target      plan to continue requiring them. But liberals and their public health friends don’t seem to want the pandemic to end—ever. Some lockdown advocates are warning that myriad new gene variants may be more infectious—though it’s unclear if they are—and could render vaccines less effective. They also warn that vaccinated individuals might still transmit the virus if they are asymptomatic (though the probability is low). Ergo, pandemic restrictions must be maintained until we achieve herd immunity—which the experts also say may never happen because of new more transmissible variants and the potential for reinfection. This eternal public health crisis is unsustainable politically and economically. Washington can’t keep passing trillion-dollar spending bills with jobless benefits, food stamps, cash payments, rent subsidies and other welfare to help unemployed (and many gainfully employed) Americans. Forget the mental health toll on people who have been cooped up for a year. But Democrats seem pleased they can use the pandemic to expand the welfare state. Some are now demanding recurring stimulus checks and enhanced unemployment benefits tied to economic conditions. “This crisis is far from over, and families deserve certainty that they can put food on the table and keep a roof over their heads,” 10 Democratic Senators wrote to Mr. Biden this week. Meanwhile, they are preparing a giant climate-infrastructure spending bill that they say is urgently needed to jolt the economy and save the planet.

At least four recent studies have identified coronaviruses closely related to the pandemic strain in bats and pangolins in Southeast Asia and Japan, a sign that these pathogens are more widespread than previously known and that there was ample opportunity for the virus to evolve. Another new study suggests that a change in a single amino acid in a key component of the virus enabled or at least helped the virus become infectious in humans. Amino acids are organic compounds that form proteins. Public-health officials say it is critical to identify the origin of the pandemic to take steps to avert future outbreaks, though it may take years to do so. These latest pieces of research add to evidence that the virus, called SARS-CoV-2, likely originated in bats and then evolved naturally to infect humans, possibly through an intermediary animal. The studies also help explain why members of a WHO team that in February completed a four-week mission to Wuhan—the Chinese city where the first known cases of Covid-19 were found—advocate searching for the origin of the pandemic in other countries in addition to China, particularly those along its border in Southeast Asia.

The group of two dozen scientists is calling in an open letter on Thursday for a new international inquiry. They say the WHO team that last month completed a mission to Wuhan—the Chinese city where the first known cases were found—had insufficient access to adequately investigate possible sources of the new coronavirus, including whether it slipped from a laboratory. Their appeal comes as the U.S.—which recently reversed a decision to leave the WHO—lobbies for greater transparency in the investigation, saying it is waiting to scrutinize the report on the Wuhan mission, and urging China to release all relevant data, including on the first confirmed infections in December 2019, and potential earlier ones. Beijing, meanwhile, is pressing for similar WHO-led missions to other countries, including the U.S., to investigate whether the virus could have originated outside China and spread to Wuhan via frozen food packaging. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesussaid on Feb. 12 that the team would release an interim report briefly summarizing the Wuhan mission, possibly the following week, with a full report coming weeks later. But that summary report has yet to be published and the WHO team is now scrapping that plan, said Peter Ben Embarek, the food-safety scientist who led the team. The WHO team plans to publish a summary along with the full, final report, he said. That final report “will be published in coming weeks and will include key findings,” a WHO spokesman said.  "

His firm, Enesi Pharma Ltd. of Oxfordshire, England, is developing a device that painlessly implants a vaccine-imbued tube of sugars smaller than a grain of rice under the skin. The pandemic has sparked a research-and-development gold rush in vaccines. Developers of novel vaccine-delivery technology hope that they are next, and that the drive to inoculate the planet will shower them with investment dollars and entice big-name partners with deep pockets who can help bring their products to market. Theirs is a field littered with development misfires and costly gadgets that, for decades, failed to unseat the simple needle, syringe and glass vial. Aside from the occasional nasal spray for flu or sugar lump for polio, the hypodermic needle has been the mainstay of protecting against infectious disease since it was pioneered by a Dublin physician in 1844. Skeptics say that because needles are so inexpensive, abundant and effective, that isn’t likely to change. But the belief among delivery-technology executives and others in the vaccine world is that the pandemic has revealed to all what they have long seen as a false economy. Vaccinating millions isn’t a cheap and easy task when the existing technology requires freezing cold-chain logistics, an army of trained personnel to inject needles, long lines, wasted doses and billions of dollars.

Instead, the 36-year-old Italian, who just postponed her wedding for a second time, is starting to wonder whether she should have a child at all. “Our plan was always to get married and then to start a family,” said Ms. Di Iorio, an osteopath from Rome whose fiance has been out of work for nearly a year, ever since a gym they co-own was forced to close because of measures to stop the spread of Covid-19. “We no longer have the kind of stability my partner and I worked so hard to achieve. And I’m getting older,” she said. A year into the pandemic, early data and surveys point to a baby bust in many advanced economies from the U.S. to Europe to East Asia, often on top of existing downward trends in births. A combination of health and economic crises is prompting many people to delay or abandon plans to have children. Demographers warn the dip is unlikely to be temporary, especially if the pandemic and its economic consequences drag on. “All evidence points to a sharp decline in fertility rates and in the number of births across highly developed countries,” said Tomas Sobotka, a researcher at the Wittgenstein Center for Demography and Global Human Capital in Vienna. “The longer this period of uncertainty lasts, the more it will have lifelong effects on the fertility rate.”  "

Similarly, the European Commission plans this month to present proposals for a “digital green pass” for EU citizens, which will specify if someone has been vaccinated, and if not, carry details of their test results. EU leaders expect it to take three months to get the program running. “The aim is to gradually enable them [EU citizens] to move safely in the European Union or abroad—for work or tourism,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said.

Johnson & Johnson’s Covid-19 vaccine, which was authorized Saturday for use in the U.S., is at the vanguard of a class of shots designed to mobilize a person’s immune defenses against the disease. It will be the first Covid-19 vaccine administered in the U.S. that uses viral-vector technology, which employs an engineered cold virus to ferry coronavirus-fighting genetic code to the body’s cells. J&J’s vaccine is the third to be authorized in the U.S. after ones from  Pfizer Inc.  and its partner,  BioNTech SE ,  and  Moderna Inc.  In a late-stage trial, J&J’s single-shot vaccine was 66% effective in preventing moderate to severe cases of the disease that has killed more than 500,000 people in the U.S. and about 2.5 million world-wide. “This is one of those giant leap moments for us. These are fundamental shifts in how we will build vaccines for the future,” said C. Buddy Creech, director of Vanderbilt University’s vaccine research program. “I think this really ushers in a golden age of vaccinology.” New vaccine technologies spurred by the pandemic are leading efforts to combat Covid-19 and herald a new arsenal of weapons for fighting lethal viruses in the future, infectious-disease researchers said, another example of how the fight against Covid has supercharged technological development."

The move was prompted by the persisting shortage of vaccines in Italy and the EU, delays in the supply of vaccines by AstraZeneca and the fact that Australia is considered a “nonvulnerable country” to Covid-19 under EU regulations, Italy’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said. The decision affects 250,700 doses, a number the ministry said was high compared with what has been delivered so far by AstraZeneca. The doses were bottled at a factory near Rome that is part of the company’s supply chain. AstraZeneca has delivered around 1.5 million doses to Italy, according to the government. Representatives for AstraZeneca declined to comment on the decision. The move by Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi’s government in Rome is the first use of a new EU policy that allows controls to be imposed on the export of Covid-19 vaccines. The EU is struggling to meet public expectations of a large-scale vaccine rollout that would rein in Covid-19 contagion and allow the easing of onerous restrictions that have weighed on Europe’s daily life and economy for months.

Andrew Cuomo’s top advisers successfully pushed state health officials to strip a public report of data showing that more nursing-home residents had died of Covid-19 than the administration had acknowledged, according to people with knowledge of the report’s production. The July report, which examined the factors that led to the spread of the virus in nursing homes, focused only on residents who died inside long-term-care facilities, leaving out those who had died in hospitals after becoming sick in nursing homes. As a result, the report said 6,432 nursing-home residents had died—a significant undercount of the death toll attributed to the state’s most vulnerable population, the people said. The initial version of the report said nearly 10,000 nursing-home residents had died in New York by July last year, one of the people said. The changes Mr. Cuomo’s aides and health officials made to the nursing-home report, which haven’t been previously disclosed, reveal that the state possessed a fuller accounting of out-of-facility nursing-home deaths as early as the summer. The Health Department resisted calls by state and federal lawmakers, media outlets and others to release the data for another eight months. State officials now say more than 15,000 residents of nursing homes and other long-term-care facilities were confirmed or presumed to have died from Covid-19 since March of last year—counting both those who died in long-term-care facilities and those who died later in hospitals. That figure is about 50% higher than earlier official death tolls. Mr. Cuomo now faces mounting political pressure over both his administration’s handling of the pandemic in nursing homes and accusations that he sexually harassed two former staffers. Republicans and some Democrats have called for the governor to resign from office or be impeached.  "

Brazil’s daily death toll from the disease rose to its highest level yet this week, pushing the country’s total number of Covid-19 fatalities past a quarter of a million. On Tuesday, Brazil reported a record 1,641 Covid fatalities. Neighbor Peru is struggling to curb a second wave of infections. The new variant, known as P.1, is 1.4 to 2.2 times more contagious than versions of the virus previously found in Brazil, and 25% to 61% more capable of reinfecting people who had been infected by an earlier strain, according to a study released Tuesday. With mass vaccination a long way off across the region, countries such as Brazil risk becoming a breeding ground for potent versions of the virus that could render current Covid-19 vaccines less effective, public-health specialists warned. A more prolonged pandemic could also devastate the economies of countries such as Brazil, slowing growth and expanding the country’s already large debt pile as the government extends payouts to the poor, economists said.

It didn’t meet the moment. Instead of thoroughly investigating complaints of unsafe practices at workplaces, the federal agency and state OSHA agencies it oversees often took limited steps, OSHA records and state health data show, leaving workers more vulnerable to workplace outbreaks. When Kentucky warehouse employees complained that masks weren’t being worn at their site, when a group representing Illinois packaging workers asked if OSHA would enforce social distancing and when workers at a poultry plant said it wasn’t responding to a disease outbreak, the federal agency or a state counterpart took little action as infections at the sites increased, according to interviews, OSHA documents and health department records. OSHA’s mandate, spelled out in a 1970 law, is to help ensure safe and healthy working conditions, by setting workplace standards and enforcing them."

Andrew Cuomo imposed strict lockdown policies—many still in place—and became the media’s golden boy. “The governor of New York’s morning news conferences have become part of the country’s new daily rhythm,” the Washington Post’s Style section gushed in March 2020. “He’s the strongman who can admit he’s wrong. He speaks fluently about the facts. He worries about his mother, and by extension, yours, too.” Gov. Ron DeSantis took a different approach and was pilloried. He was among the first to lift his state lockdown, adopting something resembling Sweden’s strategy of protecting the vulnerable while keeping businesses and schools open. “Florida Man Leads His State to the Morgue,” read a June headline in the New Republic. “Ron DeSantis is the latest in a long line of Republicans who made the state a plutocratic dystopia. Now he’s letting its residents die to save the plutocrats.” A year after the virus hit the U.S., Mr. Cuomo’s luster has faded, and Mr. DeSantis can claim vindication. The Sunshine State appears to have weathered the pandemic better than others like New York and California, which stayed locked down harder and longer. Mortality data bear out this conclusion. The Covid death risk increases enormously with each decade of age. More than 80% of Covid deaths in the U.S. have occurred among seniors over 65. They make up a larger share of Florida’s population than any other state except Maine. Based on demographics, Florida’s per-capita Covid death rate would be expected to be one of the highest in the country. Nope. Florida’s death rate is in the middle of the pack and only slightly higher than in California, which has a much younger population. Florida’s death rate among seniors is about 20% lower than California’s and 50% lower than New York’s, based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data.  "

CDC Director Rochelle P. Walensky gave the go-ahead Sunday after a panel of advisers voted in support of adults in the U.S. getting the one-dose vaccine. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted 12-0 in favor with one recusal. The steps concluded a review process before the shot reaches wider use, which is expected this week. “In the midst of this tragedy we do have some reason for optimism,” said committee member Dr.            Matthew Daley,      senior investigator at the Institute for Health Research with Kaiser Permanente Colorado. “How very grateful I am that we now have three safe and highly effective vaccines.” The U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized use of the single-dose shot on Saturday based on its 66% effectiveness at preventing moderate to severe Covid-19 disease in a large study that also showed it was safe. Pfizer Moderna J&J Number of doses 2 2 1 Overall efficacy 95.0 % 66.1 94.1 Efficacy against severe disease 75.0 * 100 85.4 Efficacy in people 65 and older 94.7 86.4 68.6 Efficacy in U.S. 94.9 94.1 72.0 *Based on a small number of severe cases in study. Note: Results based on the companies’ varying clinical trials and methodologies Source: the companies, Food and Drug Administration; New England Journal of Medicine J&J said after the FDA clearance that it had started to ship doses of its vaccine for allocation and distribution by the federal government. The doses are expected to start reaching vaccine providers in the U.S. in the coming days, with vaccinations starting soon afterward. It was the third Covid-19 vaccine cleared by the FDA, after the agency’s clearance in December of shots from            Pfizer Inc.              PFE 0.05%            with its partner            BioNTech SE              BNTX 2.40%            and from            Moderna Inc.              MRNA 3.29% The addition of the J&J vaccine is expected to boost the mass vaccination campaign aiming to bring the pandemic under control. Demand for the previously authorized vaccines has outpaced supply so far. More than 75 million of the 96.4 million doses distributed nationwide have been administered, according to the CDC. J&J expects to ship about four million doses right away, and to deliver another 16 million by the end of March. By the end of June, J&J expects to provide a total of 100 million doses for use in the U.S.  The federal government has purchased the doses and is making them available free to people. The new supplies should help more people get vaccinated, especially after J&J increases its output. Yet health authorities don’t expect the availability of three shots will mean that many people will start having a choice among them soon. Each of the three authorized shots works well, according to the authorities, who encourage people to get whichever vaccine they can get. The CDC’s vaccine advisory committee members—physicians, public-health officials and infectious-disease specialists—discussed the clinical evidence for J&J’s vaccine during an online meeting. Members of the committee generally had favorable comments about the vaccine, but some expressed concerns. One concern was that in the large clinical trial, J&J’s vaccine appeared to be less effective among people age 60 and older who had certain medical conditions such as diabetes and hypertension. 1. In classic vaccines, such as those against measles and polio, the patient is inoculated with weakened or inactivated versions of the virus. This triggers the immune system to produce specialized antibodies that are adapted to recognize the virus. 2. After vaccination, the antibodies remain in the body. If the patient later becomes infected with the actual virus, the antibodies can identify and help neutralize it.

She said it wasn’t in line with the rest of the trial data, which support that the vaccine provides protection. The efficacy among American Indian and Alaska Natives also was lower than the overall efficacy in the study. Committee members also began to wrestle with the potentially difficult task of comparing the three authorized vaccines and giving guidance about whether people should choose one over the others. The question has arisen partly because the overall efficacy of J&J’s vaccine in a large trial was lower than that for Pfizer’s and Moderna’s from separate trials. For now, the committee isn’t expressing a preference, with members saying it is tough to compare and contrast the vaccines across different trials, and that all three were generally safe and effective. “We want to make sure the public understands the best vaccine is the one they can get access to,” said Dr.            Jason Goldman,      a liaison to the committee from the American College of Physicians.

First, I had to navigate through a corn maze of menus to find the actual booking page. Then, once I miraculously scored an appointment slot by clicking incessantly, and entered all the requested information, it vanished like a mothball in the snow.  “The Covid-19 vaccine demand heavily outweighs supply,” said a Rite Aid spokesman. “When the appointments are made available they are filled quickly.” An issue on the website, which didn’t hold your appointment slot when you’d start to input your personal information, has since been fixed, he added. Congrats! You survived 12 months of pandemic! Now fragmented systems, shoddy websites and limited vaccine supply stand in the way of you and, well, the rest of your life. It’s one of the most important human-vs.-machine battles of our time. And it’s made worse by the fact that most humans currently eligible to enter the fray are over 65 and not necessarily glued to a keyboard all day. Many sites don’t take appointments over the phone, either. But let me tell you, these systems are maddeningly broken, no matter your age or technical skill level. From national pharmacy chains to hospitals to local supermarkets, every Covid-19 vaccine-appointment website I’ve been to has made me feel like I’m bad at computers. And I’ve, well, you know, been reviewing computers for nearly two decades! So I set out to beat these Byzantine, Hunger-Game-like systems—and help eligible family and friends in the process, much like the generous, tech-savvy volunteers booking appointments for those in need across the country. Along the way I met 34-year-old Kris Slevens, an IT guy who’s booked over 350 appointments for New Jersey seniors. He let me into his process, which includes setting up a browser tool and adding a couple of browser extensions. You don’t have to be some hacker or ticket scalper to master these tricks: In the subsequent week, I booked 11 appointments in five states, including Maryland, New York and New Jersey—some on the websites of pharmacy companies CVS, Rite Aid and Walgreens. Have you successfully booked a vaccine appointment online? If so, share your tips. If not, what have you found frustrating? Join the conversation below. Does this mean you’ll be able to score an appointment as soon as you read this? I wish. This whole thing is like a Vegas poker game: You can increase your odds with some skill and good timing, but a lot of it is luck of the draw. (What this guide isn’t for? Cutting the line. My advice will help book appointments for people whose states have deemed them eligible for Covid-19 vaccination.) Because the U.S. lacks a centralized sign-up system, everything is localized to the state or county level. What works in one place might not work in another. So            Facebook              FB 1.55%            groups have popped up in most states, with members who scout the local websites and available appointments. Many groups, such as the one that Kris moderates, help book appointments for in-need seniors. If you plan to ask for help from someone you don’t know, be careful. Don’t share highly personal information such as passwords or Social Security numbers. Having booked for many, I know that only basic contact info—name, date of birth, address, phone number and email address—is usually needed. Head to Facebook and search for your state and “Covid vaccine.” In the New Jersey, New York and Maryland groups, I found active members providing minute-to-minute updates, links and even detailed spreadsheets about locations and appointments. People have also created            Twitter              TWTR 4.21%            accounts to provide instant updates on appointment openings. To see how other states work, I offered to help a Maryland couple in their 70s. I followed MDVaxAlerts and set up push notifications on my iPhone. (Tap the little bell icon on the account page.) I was alerted to new openings at a CVS location and, within five minutes, successfully booked two appointments. Some people have also built websites that aggregate all the locations in a state, such as this one in New York. Some other good resources for local information: Vaccine Finder, run by Boston Children’s Hospital; this AARP page, with information grouped by state; and this site that scans pharmacy sites for availability in different states. When you’ve picked a vaccine location, click to its website. Find the page that tells you whether appointments are available, and the page where you book an appointment. Yes, sometimes those are different. Once you have the links, bookmark them. I suggest using a laptop or desktop for all of this; working on a phone or tablet could slow you down. If you’d like to get a vaccine through one of the big pharmacy chains, here are some specific tips: I didn’t use Walmart or any of the smaller pharmacy chains, but I suggest leaning on your local Facebook groups for information about timing and other site tips. In your browser, locate your autofill settings. This will allow you to store your full name, email address, home address and phone number in the browser. When it comes time to fill in all this, the browser will drop it in—no time wasted typing or copying and pasting. “Any way that you can get a millisecond faster than the other person is crucial,” Kris told me, “especially when you can have 50,000 people vying for one cancellation spot.” In Chrome, go to Settings > Autofill. In Microsoft Edge, Settings > Personal Information, then click the edit button. In Safari, Preferences > AutoFill > AutoFill web forms > Using information from my contacts. Now the hard part: Staying up-to-date on these sites and available appointments. Appointments can disappear minutes after they’re released, so in addition to the Twitter and Facebook resources, I’ve used two tools to try to catch them. The first is a browser extension called Page Refresh. It will refresh the page you’re on every few seconds or minutes, without you clicking anything. I keep this open on my second monitor. It’s available for Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge (and similar extensions are available for other browsers). The Page Refresh developer says the extension doesn’t collect any user data. One important tip: If you see an open appointment, stop the refresher ASAP. If it refreshes while you’re inputting information, you could lose your place. That solution requires you to keep your eyes on the page. A tool called Visualping can do the watching for you. You tell the service’s website or browser extension what website to monitor, then you highlight the part of the site that you expect to change—in this case something that reads “no appointments” or “appointments booked.” If it changes, you get a computer notification or an email alert. For sites such as Walgreens and CVS that require your ZIP Code to check for open appointments, you can set that up with Visualping’s advanced tools as well. The free version of Visualping lets you watch two websites, but it only scans once a day. That isn’t going to cut it. I tried the $58-a-month version, which scans every five minutes, and caught an email that led me to a successful booking on a hospital’s website. The free browser extension is more economical: It allows you to set the cadence to a minute but you’ll have to be at the computer to receive the notification—no email alerts. Visualping created this tutorial and list of Covid-19 vaccine sites to monitor. And then…you wait. When that appointment pops up, breathe. It gets intense. According to my Apple Watch, my heart rate has risen five to 10 beats a minute when I’m booking. Move as fast as you can but not so fast that you don’t read the messages and the prompts. None of the sites are as slick as Ticketmaster, with that helpful booking timer. Generally, you can skip adding insurance info. If it’s needed, you can show it at the appointment. And if you have the option to choose from a variety of days and times, don’t choose the first slots. Go for something in the middle, where demand isn’t as intense. Most people try to book the first available appointment, Kris said. Whatever happens, please just remember: It isn’t you; it’s the Covid-19 vaccine-booking website. You’re smart, you’re capable and you’re damn good at computers. —For more WSJ Technology analysis, reviews, advice and headlines, sign up for our weekly newsletter.

The state was one of the earliest to resume in-person instruction in August, following an executive order by Education Commissioner Richard Corcoran that directed districts to provide families the option of classroom learning five days a week or risk losing funding. The mandate triggered outcry among some teachers and parents who considered it risky, and drew unsuccessful lawsuits aimed at blocking it. In the seven months since, Florida schools have avoided major outbreaks of Covid-19 and maintained case rates lower than those in the wider community. Mr. Corcoran said 80% of students in Florida are now attending schools in-person full- or part-time. But the process at times has been messy, disruptive and divisive. “It felt rushed and certainly had some glitches,” said Barbara Jenkins, superintendent of Orange County Public Schools, which includes Orlando. But, she added, “I would say overall it has been successful.”  "

Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Portugal and the Netherlands said they would start vaccinating residents again after the European Medicines Agency on Thursday said new expert analysis concluded that the benefits of using a Covid-19 vaccine produced by AstraZeneca outweigh its potential risks. EU authorities are hoping the EMA’s statement could put a problem-plagued vaccination campaign back on track, although it remains to be seen whether the new analysis will overcome mistrust of the AstraZeneca shot—the world’s most widely used vaccine—among many Europeans. Many European countries, including Germany, France and Italy, suspended the vaccine’s use over the past week following reports that people who had received it developed rare blood clots, and some had died, further slowing Europe’s already sluggish vaccination rollout. Those reports compounded the delays and uncertainties surrounding a drive that has left the EU far behind the U.S. and the U.K. in vaccinating its citizens. AstraZeneca said after the EMA’s announcement and a similar judgment from British health authorities that the opinions affirmed the vaccine’s benefits. “We trust that, after the regulators’ careful decisions, vaccinations can once again resume across Europe,” said Ann Tayler, the company’s chief medical officer.

Suffering from what’s often referred to as “long Covid,” an estimated roughly 10% to 30% of Covid patients continue to experience symptoms months after their initial diagnosis. Many had mild to moderate Covid cases at first, and didn’t require hospitalization. But months later, they are grappling with often-debilitating symptoms that can include brain fog, fatigue, shortness of breath, racing heart beat, and an inability to tolerate physical or mental exertion. Doctors are struggling to determine what causes the symptoms, exactly how many people are affected and why some suffer while others recover. It’s unclear why women—generally younger or in middle age, who were previously healthy—appear to be disproportionately affected, according to the demographics of post-Covid clinics and support groups. But there is growing consensus that it is a significant disease that needs to be better understood. In February, the National Institutes of Health announced a major initiative to study long Covid, backed by $1.15 billion in funding. “Large numbers of patients who have been infected with [Covid] continue to experience a constellation of symptoms long past the time that they’ve recovered from the initial stages of Covid-19 illness,” said NIH Director Francis S. Collins in the announcement. He pointed to a survey of more than 3,700 self-described Covid long-haulers that indicated nearly half couldn’t work full-time six months after developing prolonged symptoms. The findings came from patient-led research that sprung out of a long Covid advocacy group called Body Politic. A February study in JAMA found that roughly one-third of 177 people who’d largely had mild Covid cases reported persistent symptoms up to nine months after illness. Nearly 30% of nonhospitalized patients reported worse quality of life. Another recent study, in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases, found that 66% of 118 patients with mild to moderate Covid had at least one symptom four months later. Nearly 40% reported a work impairment and 11% said they had to miss some work due to their symptoms.  "

The show of hands came after a four-week joint study in the city where the first cases were identified, a mission many hoped would provide some clarity to a world craving answers. For a while, it appeared to. The vote’s results captured headlines: The virus probably jumped to humans from an animal; further research was needed on whether it spread on frozen food; a lab leak was “extremely unlikely.” A month on, however, as the WHO-led team finalizes its full report on the Wuhan mission, a Wall Street Journal investigation has uncovered fresh details about the team’s formation and constraints that reveal how little power it had to conduct a thorough, impartial examination—and call into question the clarity its findings appeared to provide. China resisted international pressure for an investigation it saw as an attempt to assign blame, delayed the probe for months, secured veto rights over participants and insisted its scope encompass other countries as well, the Journal found."

A new coronavirus strain was surging across the country, thousands of holidaymakers were due to return from Covid-19 hot spots, and one in three coronavirus tests was coming back positive. Then something unexpected happened: Covid-19 cases started dropping. Since mid-January, confirmed Covid-19 infections in South Africa have fallen from a record of nearly 22,000 a day to around 1,000, without a large-scale vaccination campaign or stringent lockdown. Fewer than 5% of Covid-19 tests are finding traces of the virus, a sign that health agencies are missing fewer cases. The government has lifted most of its remaining virus restrictions for the country of 60 million people. The cause of this steep decline in cases remains somewhat of a mystery. As in other countries that have at some point experienced surprising drops in Covid-19 cases—such as India, Pakistan and some parts of Brazil—epidemiologists and virologists are piecing together different explanations for why the outbreak in South Africa isn’t following patterns set elsewhere. Those range from important population groups reaching sufficient levels of immunity to slow down transmission, to people sticking more closely to social-distancing rules, such as wearing masks and voluntarily reducing contacts, when deaths were mounting before the decline.

Israel, a small, wealthy nation with a young population, was uniquely qualified to confront the pandemic: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had secured enough vaccine stocks by paying more, as well as by offering access to Israelis’ personal health data to gauge the vaccine’s effectiveness. Its healthcare system had the means to quickly deliver the shots into the arms of Israelis. The country’s four health-management organizations used centralized data-keeping, technology and the cradle-to-grave ties between Israelis and their doctors to speed up the vaccination drive, targeting residents nationwide with text messages, emails and phone calls. The efficiencies of Israel’s HMOs have been honed by years of competing for patients—and for the tax revenue gained by adding each new member—as they try to outdo each other in quality and availability of care. “It’s really a unique structure,” said economist Moshe Bar Siman Tov, who oversaw Israel’s coronavirus response last year. “I’m not sure it’s possible to duplicate it. It’s a mixture of socialist fundamentals and entrepreneurial spirit.” Israel’s bars and restaurants reopened last week to vaccinated people, prompting street parties in Tel Aviv, and the country is now looking ahead to a broader economic rebound."

A cascade of cautionary pauses that started last week picked up Monday. Denmark was the first to suspend the shots. Ireland, Norway, the Netherlands and Iceland have also said they would wait for Europe’s bloc-wide medicines regulator to investigate a small number of serious blood-clotting issues among people who had received the AstraZeneca shot. That regulator, the European Medicines Agency, is expected by Thursday to give its verdict on safety and potential risks from a review of the reported cases. The agency on Monday repeated an advisory from last week that for now it is recommending countries keep using the vaccine, saying the benefits outweigh possible risks. The EMA, which acts much like the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in regulating medicine across the European Union, has said there was no evidence of a link between the reported blood clots and the vaccine. The U.K.’s medicines regulator, the first to green-light the shot for mass use in late December, maintained that stance as well, telling Britons to get their shots as planned. Around 11 million AstraZeneca shots have been administered in the U.K., making it a central pillar of the country’s fast-paced rollout.  "

Such persistent feelings can signal impostor syndrome, where self-doubts engender fears of being exposed as a fraud despite one’s accomplishments. Covid created fertile conditions for impostor syndrome, as workers watched some jobs become remote while others vanished. “With the pandemic, people are increasingly working in isolation, so it doesn’t surprise me that it’s really exacerbated,” says Valerie Young, author of “The Secret Thoughts of Successful Women: Why Capable People Suffer from the Impostor Syndrome and How to Thrive in Spite of It.” It is normal to feel like an impostor every so often, with up to 82% of people doing so at some point, according to research published in 2019 in the Journal of General Internal Medicine. The findings were based on responses from more than 14,000 participants across 62 studies. Researchers found that impostor syndrome was common among men and women from adolescence well into adulthood and particularly high among ethnic minority groups. Students of color who navigate predominately white environments may experience more pressure to prove that they belong and show others that they aren’t being tokenized for reasons unrelated to merit, says Kevin Cokley, a professor of educational psychology and African-American studies at the University of Texas at Austin. Amid the pandemic’s labor-market turmoil, “it stands to reason that impostor feelings could creep up especially in ethnic minorities trying to get a job when they have already dealt with impostor feelings as students,” Dr. Cokley says.

The issues largely involve systems that states are using to try to report Covid-19 data in near real time, and not deaths reported more slowly through death certificates. These front-line numbers are the ones that fuel state dashboards and data trackers, like the closely watched one created by Johns Hopkins University, which help policy makers and the public closely monitor pandemic trends. Ohio in February announced more than 4,000 additional deaths while reconciling its data, and Indiana added about 1,500. Smaller revisions have also recently come from Virginia, Minnesota and Rhode Island. On Thursday, authorities in West Virginia said medical providers hadn’t properly reported 168 deaths to the state’s public-health department. “Nobody likes surprises, and nobody likes data that’s wrong because that’s what drives decisions,” said Ayne Amjad, West Virginia’s state health officer. These issues underscore ways in which Covid-19 can still challenge data-reporting systems in the U.S. Like many countries, the U.S. is trying to track pandemic events nearly as they happen, and a big part of this effort has required speeding up how deaths are reported.

Earlier this month, the clinic was on the road to deliver five of the first Covid-19 vaccines it received. Mondy Gardner, 59 years old, was waiting when the Health Wagon came to give him his first dose at his best friend’s house. With diagnoses of muscular dystrophy and lung disease, Mr. Gardner said he has been too afraid of contracting Covid-19 to visit a doctor’s office during the pandemic. “I hope it works,” he said of the vaccine, rolling up his sleeve in the yard. President Biden has called on states to make all adults eligible for the vaccine by May 1. More than 111 million doses have been administered in the U.S. so far. As the inoculation drive gains pace, officials are ramping up strategies for getting the vaccine to hard-to-reach populations."

People have the freedom to choose, he said, adding, “It’s a great vaccine. It’s a safe vaccine and it’s something that works.” Mr. Trump previously mentioned the vaccine during a speech before the Conservative Political Action Conference last month in Florida. “So everybody, go get your shot,” he said, a message overshadowed in that context by Mr. Trump’s attacks on fellow Republicans in the fallout of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. What impact on vaccination rates do you think Donald Trump’s endorsement will have? Join the conversation below. Mr. Trump and his wife, Melania, received the vaccine before leaving the White House in January but didn’t publicize it. And Mr. Trump isn’t featured alongside former presidents            Barack Obama,            George W. Bush,            Bill Clinton      and            Jimmy Carter      in a joint ad campaign urging people to get vaccinated. While vaccine distribution is speeding up in the U.S., some segments of the population are declining to get the shot for a variety of reasons, including worries about side effects and distrust of the government. Research has shown vaccine hesitancy is particularly an obstacle in the Black and Hispanic communities. There are partisan barriers, too. A CBS News poll released Sunday showed 33% of Republicans said they wouldn’t get the vaccine, compared with 10% of Democrats and 23% of independents. In a separate poll from NPR/PBS NewsHour and Marist, 30% of all adults said they wouldn’t get the vaccine while 49% of Republican men and 47% of identified Trump supporters said they wouldn’t. Some public-health experts have called on Mr. Trump to speak out. “He has such an incredible influence over people in the Republican Party,”            Dr. Anthony Fauci,      director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Sunday on Fox News. ”It would really be a game changer if he did.” On Monday, President Biden was asked if his predecessor should help. “I discussed it with my team, and they say the thing that has more impact than anything Trump would say to the MAGA folks is what the local doctor, what the local preachers, what the local people in the community say,” he said, encouraging those people to make the case for vaccination. In the interview Tuesday, Mr. Trump cited his administration’s efforts to get vaccine development started, saying: “This would have happened in many, many years from now if we didn’t, if I didn’t get involved.” Write to Alex Leary at alex.leary@wsj.com Copyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The latest blow to once-close relations between major U.S. allies came when the EU announced it would consider giving member states more power to block Covid-19 vaccine exports, of which the U.K. has been the largest non-EU recipient. The U.K.’s vaccine campaign has delivered at least one shot to almost half the adults in the country, in contrast with the EU’s so-far faltering rollout. Britain left the bloc on Jan. 31 last year and began a new economic relationship at the start of this year based on a last-minute trade deal that spelled out an arm’s-length trading relationship. At the time, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the agreement marked “a resolution of the old, tired, vexed question of Britain’s political relations with Europe which has bedeviled our postwar history.” He said the U.K. would be the “best friend and ally the EU could have.”  "

Take it from me: I played many hands of the game and have nothing to show for the effort. Granted, I had no Zoom schooling sessions to enforce, no children to parent, no job to perform remotely. I did work, but at a studio with strictly enforced Covid-19 protocols, along with a large crew who had all been bubbled for the duration of the pandemic. During a time of lockdowns, quarantines and social distancing, solitaire seemed like a harmless enterprise, a salve for the mind and the hands, a safety valve that meant having something to do. The deck of cards was right there on the table, and, without thinking, my hands would take up that file of 52 to riff and shuffle and cut. A game would be dealt—to myself, by myself—in a line of seven cards with a growing pile of face-downs. The cards in my hand were revealed in threes, and the blacks were played on the reds, and so on, and an hour or so would pass. I would play more solitaire later in the day or the next morning. I never cheated to win; winning wasn’t the point. Getting close was good enough, and there was always another game, so why not deal it out? I might win this time. And what else was there to do? Actually, there was plenty to do! Damn! There was a sink to clean out and a dishwasher to empty. Laundry to sort. Rice to put in the cooker with the timer set for breakfast. Letters I could have written and the typewriter and stationery to do it. Books I had packed in a suitcase were set on a reading stack, unread, even though I was, sort of, always reading one of them. There were floor exercises and yoga stretches to do. I have kids to talk to when they are available. I have business partners to contact. I have friends who are hilarious and interesting. I have scenes to study and work to prepare. I have stories in my head—and I tell stories for a living—that could have been sketched out, noted, outlined. I could have re-watched “Chernobyl” on HBO! I did get around to doing many of those things. I lived up to most of my responsibilities and explored a few creative recesses inside my thick head. But those hands of solitaire were accumulated minutes wasted by hoping that a red six would come up or a king would be turned so I could fill an empty column. What didn’t I do instead?  "

The hitch for now: Only vaccines made in China will qualify. Chinese embassies in the U.S., Italy, India, the Philippines and other locations say they will provide “visa facilitation” to foreign applicants who can certify that they have received a Chinese shot. To enter China, most travelers also still need to prove they have tested negative for Covid-19, obtain an antibody test, and quarantine upon arrival, according to statements Tuesday. The increasing availability of a variety of Covid-19 vaccines is prompting some governments to rethink some travel restrictions, even as hundreds of thousands of new Covid-19 infections are recorded daily around the globe. The European Union has proposed a “digital green pass” for the region’s citizens, which will specify if someone has been vaccinated and if not, carry details of their test results. China is eager to play a leading role in setting standards for future travel with “vaccine passports,” in part because opening up and facilitating business travel should boost its economy. It is also an opportunity for Chinese authorities to promote the country’s homegrown vaccines. The new policy is exploratory and “based on sufficient consideration of safety and effectiveness,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said at a regular press briefing on Tuesday.  "

Once we reach that threshold, many Americans believe, we’ll be in the clear, and the pandemic will finally fade into history. But we are unlikely ever to reach herd immunity with Covid-19—it’s not how this nightmare will end. Although case counts are now declining from their winter peak, we fear another spike from potential super-spreader events following spring break, Easter weekend, Memorial Day and the Fourth of July, or even again after the end-of-year holidays. The time to double down on our efforts to stamp out transmission is now. We must develop what amounts to a national immune system to quickly detect and repel the new outbreaks ahead, not just for this pandemic but for future ones as well. Herd immunity is achieved when the percentage of a given population that is immune, from vaccination or previous infection, becomes such that each infected person transmits the disease to an average of less than one new case. The virus, finding inadequate numbers of susceptible people to infect, then starts to die out. The threshold for herd immunity depends on the contagiousness of a given disease. For Covid-19, the best estimates suggest that at least 80% of people would need to be immune. As of this writing, 130 million doses of vaccine have been given in the U.S., leaving 46.4 million Americans fully immunized and 33 million partially immunized as they await a second dose. In addition, there have been about 30 million reported cases of Covid. Epidemiologists at the CDC and NIH estimate that perhaps an equal number of cases, some 30 million, have gone unreported.  "

So with his wife and brother, he decided to try his hand at starting a business. The three of them set out to launch a food delivery service, a booming industry at a time when restaurants were closed. They looked at sites around Queens and Brooklyn. To their amazement, the best deals were to be found across the river, in Manhattan. They spotted a location in the trendy Lower East Side neighborhood, where a ramen place operated before it closed early in the Covid-19 pandemic. The rent was so low that the Baris decided they could afford to run a sit-down restaurant rather than just delivery. They opened Meat & Bread in January, serving American fare influenced by New York’s diverse cuisines. They still can’t believe the deal they struck with their landlord: a five-year lease with a monthly rent of $5,500. That was barely half what the previous tenant paid, and four months were free. “We were not expecting him to say yes, to be honest, with that location in Manhattan,” said Khadija Bari, Mr. Bari’s wife. At the start of the pandemic, sky-high residential and commercial real-estate values had made Manhattan unaffordable for many. Three decades of rising prices for nearly every type of property had made the borough largely a place where big companies operated and wealthy people lived."

It is finding how hard living up to those commitments can be. A public spat this week with U.S. officials over the precise effectiveness of its Covid-19 shot has upset regulators and chipped away at the drugmaker’s reputation in its biggest market. The fight has heightened doubts among senior U.S. medical officials about the company’s data analysis, threatening to lengthen the regulatory review. That is already months behind schedule after a separate standoff with the Food and Drug Administration in the fall over disclosures about the vaccine’s U.K. trials. Wednesday evening U.S. time, AstraZeneca revised its estimate of the shot’s efficacy from large-scale U.S. trials based on additional data, saying it was 76% effective in preventing symptomatic Covid-19, down from the 79% it reported from an analysis on Monday. The FDA, which needs to sign off on the vaccine before it is used in the U.S., normally sends staffers to clinical trial sites to assess how data is compiled before any approval. The FDA now expects to dispatch more employees to more sites than normal because of the level of mistrust that has built up, according to a senior U.S. official. In Europe, meanwhile, the British-Swedish drugmaker faces near daily attacks by politicians facing a public backlash over slow vaccination rollouts and angered by big shortfalls in AstraZeneca’s production commitments. That, in turn, has drawn its chief executive into diplomatic tensions over vaccine supplies and which countries should get them."

They are also below the pre-pandemic high of 695,000, a threshold not crossed for 52 weeks. “The recovery is really hitting full steam again, and all of the conditions will be in place for a real, explosive liftoff in the summer when hopefully we’ve reached a higher vaccination threshold,” said Julia Pollak, labor economist at jobs site ZipRecruiter. The four-week average for jobless claims, which smooths out volatility in the weekly figures, also fell to a pandemic low of 736,000. Still, the benefits of the recovery aren’t yet reaching everyone. Millions of people are suffering from spells of long-term unemployment. Total continuing claims, a proxy for the number of people receiving benefits, rose to 19 million in the week ended March 6, from 18.2 million a week earlier. More people received aid through two federal pandemic programs that were recently extended, though those figures have been particularly volatile.  "

Perhaps it is time to introduce “blue journalism”—the new media practice of abandoning standards to work seamlessly with the progressive left against any opposition. A case study is the attempted political assassination of Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson. The press has never liked most Republicans. Yet for most of Mr. Johnson’s decade in the Senate, it’s generally described him as what he is: an outsider businessman and fiscal conservative with a focus on deficits and spending. “Wisconsin’s senior senator is a numbers guy, a believer in the power of facts and figures,” wrote Milwaukee Magazine in his first term. In recent years, serving on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, he’s developed a reputation for oversight. Compare that with the recent onslaught. “Assaulting the Truth, Ron Johnson Helps Erode Confidence In Government,” read a  New York Times news headline, over a story that called him the “Republican Party’s foremost amplifier of conspiracy theories and disinformation.” “Ron Johnson’s Crazy Train Is Somehow Getting Even Weirder,” snarked Vanity Fair. “Ron Johnson Is a Racist,” opined the Washington Post’s Kathleen Parker. Mr. Johnson is “inciting fear” the Post’s Michael Gerson added. The paper’s “fact checkers” assailed his “misleading data” and “unscientific take.” What’s this all about? From the Times story, it amounts to this: Mr. Johnson has refused to brand everyone present in Washington on Jan. 6 as “insurrectionists”; he’s continued to note that last year’s Black Lives Matter protests led to rioting, looting, arson and death; he held hearings on treatments for Covid and 2020 election integrity; and he’s declined, for now, a Covid vaccine, given he had the disease last year and decided to let others go before him. None of this is remotely conspiratorial or even controversial. Mr. Johnson’s real offense is refusing to roll over to the progressive and public-health police and continuing to ask tough questions.

Consumer spending—the biggest driver of economic activity in the U.S.—fell 1% in February, the Commerce Department said Friday. The drop was largely attributed by economists to cold weather and snowstorms that struck much of the country, shutting businesses and keeping families indoors. Household income—including Americans’ wages, investment earnings and government aid—also fell, by 7.1%, though that drop, too, was temporary. The federal government’s distribution of checks to most households as part of a $900 billion coronavirus-relief package had caused household income to rise by 10.1% the prior month, which also contributed to the jump in spending. Income reverted to more normal levels in February. Income and spending are set to rise in coming weeks, setting up the economy for what economists forecast will be the strongest growth in years after last year’s pandemic-induced contraction. Under the latest Covid-19 stimulus package—a $1.9 trillion plan signed by President Biden in March—the government has already started delivering checks to households. While unemployment remains elevated, the relief package also provided $300 a week in enhanced compensation for jobless workers. Meanwhile, millions of people are getting the vaccine every day. That combination—higher incomes and a rising number of people shielded from the worse effects of the deadly virus—is expected to unleash a burst of economic activity in coming weeks. Private-sector data on restaurant visits, hotel bookings and airline travel all show a steady pickup in spending in recent weeks. In Texas, restaurant bookings rose briskly after elected leaders lifted restrictions on businesses. Bookings there recently exceeded 2019 levels.  "

Congress and the White House have provided trillions of dollars of federal financial assistance since the Covid-19 pandemic hit the U.S. economy early last year, triggering a deep recession and uneven recovery. The resulting government budget deficits are expected to push the federal debt to 102.3% of gross domestic product by the end of the current fiscal year, up from 79.2% at the end of 2019, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The CBO forecasts the debt will grow to 107% of GDP by 2031. While a series of Covid-19 relief packages were passed in 2020 with strongly bipartisan support, GOP lawmakers have criticized President Biden’s $1.9 trillion assistance package, saying its measures are less targeted than previous bills and that the economy is already recovering.

In France, that number is closer to 10%. In Britain, case rates and hospitalizations are falling, and the rate of excess deaths from Covid has reached zero. But in Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel has warned of an “exponential” rise in cases. Ms. Merkel floated an Easter lockdown, which she quickly walked back. Italy, where more than one million people over 80 haven’t been vaccinated, has entered another lockdown. Paris and other major French cities are shut down. Critical-care hospital beds in the Paris region are full, according to Frederic Valletoux, head of France’s hospital network. Mr. Valletoux has reported “exploding” numbers and says that only lockdowns can prevent an “unprecedented violent shock” to France’s healthcare system. Europe’s third wave will cost thousands of lives and billions of euros. Summer vacationers, essential to the economies of Southern Europe, may have to stay away for a second year. This will increase the gulf in competitiveness and debt between the eurozone’s rich north and poor south. Southern states could require another bailout, a scenario deeply unpopular with German voters, who go to the polls in national elections in September. Europe’s elected leaders, French President Emmanuel Macron and Ms. Merkel in particular, are responsible for the tragedy of errors that has caused Europe’s vaccine fiasco.

Last week, another company that has seen business boom during the pandemic reported it had added millions of new customers in the previous 12 months—most of whom it expects to stick around. Petco, the animal-supply retailer, was a beneficiary of a pet boom during the long months of stay-at-home orders, when more than three million new pets were purchased or adopted. “They made being at home richer and gave somebody to go hug,” Petco Chief Executive Ron Coughlin told me. But the trends driving business to Petco tell us more than just how Americans handled the emotions of this past year. They reveal details on how months of living and working at home have created new business opportunities in unlikely places, even at brick-and-mortar retailers whose best days were once thought to be behind them. Pet ownership in the U.S. has become its own economic barometer, similar to the way RV sales famously foretell how economically secure the country is feeling. The puppy boom is more than adorable. It’s telling in what it says about how we want to work and live in a post-pandemic world.  "

Nationwide, the infusion of money will help districts reduce health risks, as well as help children catch up.

Americans went out less in January, February and early March compared with the same period in 2020, before the Covid-19 pandemic forced state lockdowns. The number of times people spent 10 minutes or more away from home was down 6% across the U.S., according to data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. In some states, including Mississippi, Alabama and the Dakotas, people ventured out at almost the same rate they did in early 2020. Foot-traffic data analyzed by The Wall Street Journal show that many people have returned to restaurants but are far less enthusiastic about movie theaters. Fewer people are filling congregation pews in every state except Wyoming. Gyms in North Dakota are busier than before the pandemic, but fewer people are hopping onto treadmills everywhere else. Nationwide people are spending less time in traffic and sticking closer to home, compared with in early 2020. Overall, Americans are visiting houses of worship and nonessential businesses such as gyms and movie theaters a median of 19% less often than they did right before the pandemic hit. In Wyoming, North Dakota and South Dakota, these establishments have almost made a full comeback. The three states are also among the 11 states where people traveled more miles in cars than before Covid-19, while the national median dropped 6%. In the Dakotas, which have had fewer restrictions than most states, bars have been crowded, and weddings and large gatherings have taken place. Public schools have been mostly open for in-person learning since September. South Dakota and North Dakota had the two highest Covid-19 case rates per 100,000 people as of April 2. In Arizona and North Carolina, foot traffic at nonessential businesses and houses of worship in January, February and early March was closer to the national median. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper eased restrictions at the end of February, allowing retail stores, gyms and restaurants to open at 50% capacity. On March 23, the state announced that it would lift its 11 p.m. closing time for serving alcohol and increase occupancy limits for nonessential businesses. Bars, gyms, restaurants and theaters in Arizona were allowed to operate at full capacity in March.  "

That has set up a patchwork of policy-making, with dozens of bills making their way through state legislatures across the country—mostly seeking to ban vaccination requirements—and governors taking opposing stands. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, has said his administration is discussing the creation of a standardized record for people to show they have been vaccinated. In Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, has said government agencies, private businesses and institutions that received state funding can’t require people to show proof that they have been vaccinated against Covid-19. In New York, Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo introduced Excelsior Pass, a program that allows people to prove their vaccination or Covid-19 status via smartphone app or printout. Florida’s Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis issued an executive order last month prohibiting businesses from requiring patrons or employees to provide documentation certifying Covid-19 vaccination.

The international economy is recovering faster than many economists projected just weeks ago, powered by growth in the U.S. and China and by the accelerating pace of vaccinations in many rich countries. Yet a new wave of lockdowns—from Europe to Canada—is threatening that growth, as many low- and middle-income nations with limited resources lag behind. “The window of opportunity is closing fast,” said Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, co-host with the World Bank of the gathering, in previewing the issues facing central bankers and finance ministers. “The longer it takes to speed up vaccine production and rollout, the harder it will be to achieve these gains,” she said. In a report to be released on Tuesday, the IMF plans to raise its forecast for global growth for this year, from the 5.5% expansion projected in January, Ms. Georgieva said in her presentation Wednesday. That would follow an estimated 3.5% contraction in 2020, the worst peacetime outcome since the Great Depression.

The idea is simple: Once you’ve received your shots, you get a document or phone app, which you flash to gain entry to previously locked-down venues—restaurants, theaters, sports arenas, offices, schools. It sounds like a way of easing coercive lockdown restrictions, but it’s the opposite. To see why, consider dining. Restaurants in most parts of the U.S. have already reopened, at limited capacity in some places. A vaccine passport would prohibit entry by potential customers who haven’t received their shots. It would restrict the freedom even of those who have: If you’re vaccinated but your spouse isn’t, forget about dining out as a couple. Planes and trains, which have continued to operate throughout the pandemic, would suddenly be off-limits to the unvaccinated. The only places where restrictions would be relatively eased would be those still fully locked down, such as many live-event venues and schools. Yet even there, the passport idea depends on keeping the underlying restrictions in place—giving officials an incentive to do so for much longer as leverage to overcome vaccine resistance. The vaccine passport should therefore be understood not as an easing of restrictions but as a coercive scheme to encourage vaccination. Such measures can be legitimate: Many schools require immunization against common childhood illnesses, and visitors to some African countries must be vaccinated against yellow fever. But Covid vaccine passports would harm, not benefit, public health. The idea that everybody needs to be vaccinated is as scientifically baseless as the idea that nobody does. Covid vaccines are essential for older, high-risk people and their caretakers and advisable for many others. But those who’ve been infected are already immune. The young are at low risk, and children—for whom no vaccine has been approved anyway—are at far less risk of death than from the flu. If authorities mandate vaccination of those who don’t need it, the public will start questioning vaccines in general.  "

An A and B student before the pandemic, she was failing three classes. The academic slide left her mother, Carola Mengolini, in tears.

The U.K. government said this week that trials for a Covid-19 certificate system would start this month and continue through May. With some exemptions, people will be required to show proof that they have a recent negative virus test, have been vaccinated or are immune after recovering from Covid-19 to enter certain events at nightclubs and sports arenas including the soccer FA Cup final. Britain’s National Health Service is developing digital and nondigital ways for individuals to show proof of their virus status with “security and privacy at the core of this approach,” according to a government document published on Monday, as the U.K. prepared to start relaxing its lockdown restrictions. Up to 20,000 people could be admitted into London’s Wembley Stadium for the May 15 FA Cup game, the document said. Cybersecurity news, analysis and insights from WSJ's global team of reporters and editors. A system to process massive amounts of personal data, particularly sensitive health information, comes with privacy risks, said            Eduardo Ustaran,      co-head of the privacy and cybersecurity practice at law firm Hogan Lovells International LLP. “The success or effectiveness of vaccine passports is about getting data protection right,” he said. The U.K. government said it will develop digital and paper versions of the certificate, but hasn’t disclosed details. Government agency Innovate UK says it has funded 10 technology companies to develop and test virus certificate systems. Some British lawmakers and business groups have criticized the plan, arguing that virus certificates would cause discrimination against people who haven’t received a shot or don’t want to share their health data. The document published Monday said the government is studying whether to eventually introduce the certificate system more widely, in areas such as hospitality. Prime Minister      Boris Johnson            said last month that pub owners may be allowed to decide if they will require certificates. Requiring proof of individuals’ virus status for attending events or entering buildings within the U.K. will create a “checkpoint society where we’re asking each other and anyone with authority can ask you about your health data, which is obviously some of the most sensitive data we have,” said Silkie Carlo, director of Big Brother Watch, a privacy advocacy group based in London. In the European Union, legislators last month proposed rules for a certificate system to demonstrate the virus-test and vaccine status of people moving between the 27 member countries, allowing them to travel without additional tests or quarantine restrictions that may be required in the countries they are visiting.  Officials have said they want the law, known as the Digital Green Certificate, to take effect in June. The European Commission, the EU executive body that drafted the legislation, said it will help authorities in member countries develop software to check QR codes on the certificates, which travelers will be able to use either in digital or paper form. Airlines and tourism industry groups say the EU-wide system could encourage travel after a year of lockdowns. But questions remain. It hasn’t been determined whether airlines will handle passengers’ data when they check the virus certificates, and such a requirement would make companies responsible if information is mishandled, said Agnès Leroux, policy director at Airlines for Europe, which represents carriers including            International Consolidated Airlines Group SA’s      British Airways, and Deutsche            Lufthansa AG      . “Any mistake, any data that would leak or be misused can then create fines. It would also mean close scrutiny from data privacy authorities at national level on airlines,” Ms. Leroux said. Authorities operating the EU certificate system should define how long they will keep personal data, and how long the certificates will be valid, European privacy regulators said in an opinion paper published this week. They also warned against setting up a centralized database to store Europeans’ health data. Under privacy laws in the U.K. and the EU, any application or tool that collects sensitive health data will have to be reassessed if authorities want to expand their use beyond the purposes they initially propose, such as for people attending large gatherings or international travel, Mr. Ustaran said. The law requires companies and organizations that collect personal data to make sure individuals give permission for their information to be used for a certain purpose, and to obtain permission again if their data will be used for any additional application. The U.K., which left the EU last year, still applies the bloc’s General Data Protection Regulation. In addition, Mr. Ustaran said that operators of coronavirus certificates would need to delete data when it is no longer valid, depending on how long immunity and vaccine protection lasts—which scientists still don’t know. The GDPR requires companies to keep the minimal amount of data necessary and delete information they no longer need. As well as privacy concerns, critics have raised questions about the practicality of vaccine-certificate systems. One issue is whether people will be able to prove they are vaccinated, immune or have tested negative for the virus.            Emma McClarkin,      chief executive of the British Beer & Pub Association, noted that pub workers, nearly half of whom are under 25 years old, largely haven’t been vaccinated. Adam Brooks, the proprietor of two pubs in Essex, England, estimates that hiring someone to check vaccine certificates at the door would cost him between £800 and £1,000 a week, or roughly $1,100 to $1,375. “This logistically would be impossible for pubs, restaurants and cafes to implement because we’d have to have someone at the front door from open to close,” he said. Plus, people who are turned away because they lack the proper certificate or didn’t receive a vaccine could become aggressive toward pub employees, said Mr. Brooks, who said he plans to open outdoor service at one of his pubs, the Owl, next week.

But the EU’s fortunes could change by midyear—provided that mishaps stop hampering its vaccine supply. Amid rising social and political pressure, and despite setbacks, including new safety fears over the vaccine made by  AstraZeneca  PLC, European policy makers and analysts are expressing cautious optimism that the summer could bring a turning point, when vaccine makers say production will accelerate sufficiently to reopen the economy before fall. The hoped-for vaccination breakthrough that experts estimate could see over 50% of the EU’s adult population inoculated by late July will depend on the seamless supply of shots from multiple manufacturers, as well as overcoming the logistical and administrative challenges that have so far plagued the rollout. The EU’s vaccine problems in recent months have ranged from bureaucracy and the public’s hesitancy to key suppliers slashing deliveries due to manufacturing issues. The EU expects to receive 360 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines in the second quarter, a sharp improvement on the 107 million doses it received in the first quarter. The rising supply is coming mainly from the vaccine developed by  Pfizer Inc.  and  BioNTech SE ,  which is becoming the mainstay of the EU’s inoculation campaign. Nearly 68 million doses of the vaccine were delivered in the first quarter and 200 million are expected in the second quarter. “The capacity is rapidly increasing,” Thierry Breton, the European Commissioner overseeing the EU’s vaccine strategy, said in a social-media post on Thursday. Vaccine production in Europe is more than doubling every month, he said, offering hope for an end to lockdowns. “I’m afraid we’re nowhere near ‘normal’ yet, but I am confident that we will find some normality soon.”  "

That’s an essential democratic principle, and it’s as true for coronavirus response as any other policy challenge. So it’s chilling that Google’s YouTube, through its “medical misinformation policy,” appears to be systematically undermining the ability to access material in the public interest. Last September, YouTube scrubbed a Hoover Institution interview with Scott Atlas, then one of President Trump’s coronavirus advisers. In January it censored a U.S. Senate committee hearing on unapproved coronavirus treatments. Now it has taken down a video of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis holding a policy discussion with Dr. Atlas and the three creators of the Great Barrington Declaration, a group of physicians and scientists critical of strict lockdowns to fight the coronavirus. In the hour-and-forty-five minute video, Mr. DeSantis and the four panelists lambaste the U.S. coronavirus response as excessively draconian and ineffective. They emphasize unintended public-health harms from lockdowns and school closures, criticize mask mandates and generally celebrate Florida’s response. The video was shared in a story from a Tampa Bay, Fla., news station, and its removal from YouTube was first flagged by the American Institute for Economic Research. YouTube told us Thursday in a statement that it removed the video “because it included content that contradicts the consensus of local and global health authorities regarding the efficacy of masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19.” As an example, YouTube points to a video passage where Gov. DeSantis asks one panelist, Harvard biostatistician Martin Kulldorff, whether children need to wear masks, and Mr. Kulldorff says no. Dr. Jay Battacharya of Stanford adds that masking for children is “developmentally inappropriate.” Gov. DeSantis notes, accurately, that “if we went back a year, a lot of the experts would say that wearing masks for the general public is not evidence-based.”  "

But some people aren’t willing or easily able to get vaccinated, and others won’t be able to get the shot for medical reasons, such as immune suppression. Another good weapon for the Covid arsenal would be a safe and effective drug that could be taken at home. Such outpatient drugs exist to prevent and treat the flu, and one public-health focus should be developing a Covid pill that could be taken after exposure, or soon after symptoms appear, to stop the infection from progressing. So far outpatient treatment options have been either therapeutic antibodies or repurposed medicines off the shelf. Antibodies, when given early, are very effective at preventing Covid hospitalizations and reducing the severity of symptoms. But they’re hard to administer outside a hospital setting, currently requiring time-consuming infusions. Manufacturers and public-health leaders should focus on research to make these infusions fast and easier, and to develop one-time shots that could also be used for prevention. A few repurposed drugs work, such as remdesivir and the steroid dexamethasone, which reduces the risk of death in patients who require oxygen or mechanical ventilation. More studies will help suss out the benefits of repurposed drugs, but so far many of these options have failed to show benefit in preventing mild Covid from progressing when studied in well-designed trials. The National Institutes of Health should support further research for pills engineered to interrupt how the coronavirus replicates, which would be a hedge against mutations. Vaccines and antibody drugs work by targeting surface proteins on the virus. But the novel coronavirus can alter parts of these proteins through genetic mutation. What is concerning about the mutations in Brazil, South Africa, California and New York is that the virus figured out how to tweak an important region on its spike protein, one that is the target for many of the current vaccines and antibody-based therapies. Such mutations could render antibody drugs and vaccines less effective. Enter a pill. A small-molecule drug that could block some of the core machinery that the virus uses to replicate may be able to elude these mutations. That’s because it is often harder for the virus to change the process that it uses to infect cells and replicate. Such a treatment could be an important complement to vaccines and antibody drugs, including for the small percentage of patients who may get sick despite being vaccinated. A good drug may also prevent susceptible people from developing disease after a close contact with someone infected. Such a drug can be especially useful to prevent spread when an infection occurs in a household or congregate setting.  "

Vaccitech PLC said in a securities filing it plans to use the technology underpinning the vaccine to develop treatments targeting prostate cancer, hepatitis B and human papillomavirus. The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that the IPO filing could come as soon as this week. The U.K.-based company plans to list on New York’s Nasdaq with the ticker symbol VACC.  The company was started by two Oxford scientists who helped lead the Covid-19 vaccine development  and who spun Vaccitech out of the university in 2016, with the goal of turning laboratory discoveries into commercial products. A key part of the vaccine technology uses an altered form of chimpanzee cold virus to ferry genetic material into humans to boost the immune system and fight infection. Vaccitech has been aiming for a listed valuation of around $700 million, with backers estimating it could be a $1 billion company by year-end, The Journal reported last month.  The company recently raised $168 million in new funding as a step toward a share offering. It had $4.8 million in revenue last year and a loss of about $17.7 million and hasn’t generated any revenue from product sales, according to Friday’s filing. It said Vaccitech aims to raise $100 million—a figure generally put in debut IPO filings as a placeholder to be adjusted during marketing of the company. Vaccitech to date has raised $216 million from investors including pharmaceutical giant            Gilead Sciences Inc.              GILD -0.24%            ;            Alphabet Inc.              GOOG 2.09%            ’s GV, formerly called Google Ventures; and Sequoia Capital China, an affiliate of the Silicon Valley venture-capital giant.  As the pandemic set in last year, Vaccitech was one of the most valuable companies in the portfolio of the university-affiliated Oxford Sciences Innovation PLC, though it had yet to bring a drug to market. OSI is a venture firm the university launched in 2015 to fund startups spun out from its various academic areas—from immunology to quantum computing—to compete better with U.S. institutions like the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Stanford University in commercializing research. Backers hope the IPO will create one of the biggest market debuts of an Oxford spinoff in years. Investors have had concerns about the Covid-19 vaccine’s rocky rollout, The Journal has reported. Those concerns have continued with questions about serious blood clots among a small number of people who have received the AstraZeneca vaccine. European and U.K. regulators have said there is strong evidence of a link to the rare but serious clotting events, but they have continued to recommend the vaccine as an important tool to help end the pandemic. Perceptions of the vaccine were also tarnished by confusion over U.S. clinical-trial results last month. The vaccine isn’t approved for use in the U.S. Vaccitech’s relationship with Oxford also has been marred by tensions over the company’s role in the vaccine and the terms of Oxford’s AstraZeneca deal, according to people close to the company and university. Friday’s filing notes that Vaccitech stands to make 24% of whatever royalties Oxford makes from the vaccine, as previously reported by The Journal. The filing includes a caveat that Vaccitech hasn’t seen the full contract between Oxford and AstraZeneca—something the biotech’s bankers and lawyers have sought unsuccessfully, The Journal has reported, citing people close to the parties.

Meanwhile, the pandemic “is slowing and possibly reversing some longstanding trends in human development,” such as gains in poverty reduction and gender equality, it says. The report, Global Trends 2040, envisions a rough ride ahead for the planet, with accelerating contests over resources, governments struggling to meet citizens’ aspirations, and increased fragmentation of communities where “people are likely to gravitate to information silos of people who share similar views, reinforcing beliefs and understanding of the truth.”  "

But consumer spending, held back by travel restrictions and caution over the possibility of a resurgence, has been a persistent laggard for the past year. But that, too, is starting to change as spring arrives and the country emerges from the most recent major wave of new cases in January. China’s domestic vaccination campaign is gaining steam after lagging behind those of other countries, helping dispel concerns for travelers. China’s National Health Commission said it had administered more than 140 million vaccine doses as of Monday, enough for one in 10 Chinese citizens to have received a dose. Over the recent three-day traditional tomb-sweeping holiday, which ended Monday, Chinese travelers made 102 million trips, more than double that of the same period a year earlier and equivalent to 94.5% of the trips made over the holiday in 2019, China’s Ministry of Culture and Tourism said Monday.
