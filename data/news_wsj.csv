But what profits they probably are. With one day of trading left in 2019, the S&P 500 was up 29% for the year, the Nasdaq Composite had risen 35%, and even the dowdy Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 22%.  Apple  and  Microsoft ,  which drove much of the increase in the Nasdaq, each now have market capitalizations of more than $1.2 trillion."", 
""Anyone who sold a year ago missed a major boost in net worth, yet at the time the investor mood was negative. Markets had declined in the fourth quarter of 2018 as the Federal Reserve tightened money and Donald Trump’s trade war accelerated. Fears of recession were widespread, and even Mr. Trump had stopped touting stock prices on  Twitter ."", ""One lesson is that no one knows how stocks will perform in any given year because so much can change. In 2019 the Fed quickly corrected its December 2018 mistake of raising interest rates. Inflation stayed under control. Mr. Trump decided that he wanted a trade truce with China, notwithstanding some harrowing fits and starts along the way. The momentum built by tax reform and deregulation helped the economy, and especially the job market, stay remarkably buoyant despite a trade-induced recession in manufacturing.

The turmoil has sparked calls for changes."", 
""The agency has chronic problems, and it is underfunded and overwhelmed, said\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Earl Pomeroy,\n\n\n\n      a former Democratic North Dakota congressman."", ""Nevertheless, said\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      James Bresette,\n\n\n\n      a former deputy director of the agency’s clinical-services arm, “there’s definitely some low-hanging fruit” that he believes the agency is capable of addressing."", ""The Journal’s reporting on the agency and new interviews with people who have faced the problems suggest several possible courses of action."", 
""Congress has provided modest increases to the IHS’s operating funding in recent years, but that still leaves the agency far behind other federal health programs. Medicare spends about three times as much per patient."", ""“We’re at Congress’s whim in that regard,” the agency’s acting director,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Michael Weahkee,\n\n\n\n      said in a meeting with tribal leaders earlier this year. Rear Adm. Weahkee was nominated to become the agency’s permanent leader in October."", 
""The agency’s leaders and federal overseers have stopped short of asking Congress for major new infusions during annual budget negotiations."", ""At a December Senate hearing on his nomination, Adm. Weahkee was asked if he would commit to advocating for more upfront funding for the IHS. Doing so might set him at odds with his superiors in the Trump administration. He declined to say he would seek more funding."", ""In a written statement, the IHS said it “works proactively within the administration and with the Congress to ensure the needs of Indian Country are fully understood.”"", 
""The IHS, which doesn’t offer a full range of medical services at its hospitals, is supposed to pay for patients to get additional necessary care from outside hospitals and doctors. That funding falls short of what patients need, according to the agency’s own data, and the IHS distributes it unequally."", ""In its Tucson, Ariz., region, the IHS allocated about $8,100 per uninsured patient in 2020, compared with around $1,000 in its Oklahoma area, a Journal analysis of 2017 agency data and budget records shows. In the Great Plains region, which includes the Rosebud Indian Health Service hospital in South Dakota, the allocation is about $2,200 per uninsured patient."", 
""What should the federal government do to improve care at the Indian Health Service? Join the conversation below."", ""The disparities result from an outdated allocation formula that doesn’t take the needs of the patients into consideration—and means that in low-spending areas common services are often denied."", ""At Rosebud, orthopedic procedures such as knee replacements and diagnostic services like certain lung tests often don’t get covered, doctors said."", ""“It’s basically rationing,” said\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Douglas Lehmann,\n\n\n\n      a former IHS doctor at Rosebud."",

But with finite resources, he said, “you’d have winners and losers, and so far nobody has taken that up.”"", ""The agency said one of its work groups recently recommended keeping the formula the same, and that its ability to change it was limited."", ""Eight IHS-run hospitals with a combined 82 beds averaged less than one patient a night in 2018, according to IHS reports to federal regulators."", 
""The agency could close seldom-used inpatient wards located where there are other options and redirect the money, including toward better primary care for patients with serious chronic health problems."", ""The agency said it might be appropriate to redirect resources from inpatient care to other services, such as specialty medical treatment, at some facilities where admissions have declined, and that it would consult the tribes before making any decisions."", ""Parker Indian Health Center, in a tiny Arizona town, is about 1.5 miles from a private facility, La Paz Regional Hospital. La Paz’s 22 beds were about one-quarter full last year, regulatory records show. The IHS hospital, with around 20 beds, was only about 3% full, the records show."", 
""Neither facility delivers babies, forcing women to travel at least 40 miles for that service, according to the Arizona Center for Rural Health."", ""It doesn’t make any sense to have two critical-access hospitals so close together, but not other needed services, said\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Daniel Derksen,\n\n\n\n      a University of Arizona professor and the center’s director."", ""Kevin Brown,\n\n\n\n      the chief executive of La Paz Regional, declined to comment. The Colorado River Indian Tribes, which the Parker hospital serves, said in a written statement “the facility is underutilized due to operational issues such as a lack of staff, and treatment decisions in which patients are released too soon.” The tribe said any reallocation of funding there would be a disservice to members that it would oppose."", 
""Many IHS problems stem from difficulties recruiting qualified employees to its remote facilities. The agency could fill gaps by working more closely with other health-care providers and partners, according to former employees and experts."", ""“They operate so much in their own silo,” said\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Donald Warne,\n\n\n\n      an associate dean at the University of North Dakota who directs its program to draw more Native Americans into the heath-care field."", ""Doctors say the process of getting credentialed to see patients at an IHS facility, even on a volunteer basis, is cumbersome and flawed. The Journal has reported that the agency hired doctors with histories including up to a dozen malpractice claims, criminal convictions and sex-abuse allegations."", 
""“They could streamline much of their administrative burden,” said\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Jeff Hostetter,\n\n\n\n      program director at the University of North Dakota Center for Family Medicine, who for years has volunteered at an IHS hospital where he once was employed. He said to keep working there, he recently had to complete an application about four times as long as ones he has filled out for private hospitals."", ""The IHS said it has partnerships with several academic medical systems, such as one with Massachusetts General Hospital that provides doctors to Rosebud. The agency said it is expanding such partnerships."", 
""The IHS needs to overcome a nonconfrontational culture that can lead it to defer dealing with personnel problems, according to a report by the inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services."", ""The Journal and the PBS series Frontline reported in February that the agency shuffled a pediatrician suspected of molesting boys from one hospital to another instead of confronting the problem directly. The doctor,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Stanley Patrick Weber,\n\n\n\n      has now been convicted of abusing six boys. He is appealing."", 
""“IHS is more risk averse than anybody else” when it comes to confronting personnel problems, said Mr. Bresette, the former IHS official, who also has worked in other agencies."", ""The IHS said it is working to better track such situations, and that it is filling key positions with permanent leaders to ensure consistency and accountability."", ""In one recent case, a clinic CEO named\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Eyvonne Rekow\n\n\n\n      was suspended with pay in August 2017 for alleged misconduct, then relocated to a regional office for a spell, records show.

I have just emailed the statement to the administration. It reads as follows:"", ""“Although I am aware and respectful of the many dimensions within which a university properly seeks a diverse faculty and student body, I have long been particularly concerned with the lack of intellectual diversity at the law school. A survey of U.S. law professors in general found that white Democratic professors (both male and female), Jewish professors, and nonreligious professors ‘account for most (or all) of the overrepresentation among racial, gender, religious, and ideological groups in law teaching.’ The groups that ‘account for most of the underrepresentation among racial, gender, religious, and ideological groups in law teaching’ are Republicans (both male and female), Protestants, and Catholics. This disparity persists even though ‘religious and political diversity are probably more important for viewpoint diversity than gender diversity and roughly as important as racial diversity.’"", 
""“At UCLA, we know that the campus as a whole leans substantially to the left. ‘A study of various university faculties showed that at Cornell the ratio of liberal to conservative faculty members was 166 to 6, at Stanford it was 151 to 17, at UCLA it was 141 to 9, and at the University of Colorado it was 116 to 5.’ Conservative students at UCLA have been ‘harassed, stalked, and threatened.’ I recently searched the opensecrets.org donor database for political contributions made by persons who claimed UCLA School of Law as their employer. Thirty-eight of those persons contributed solely to Democratic candidates, the Democratic Party and various affiliates, and liberal PACs. One person contributed to both Republicans and Democrats. Three persons contributed exclusively to Republican candidates, the Republican Party, and various . . . affiliates.

Think again. The new production created by William Kentridge and conducted by Yannick Nézet-Séguin that opened at the Metropolitan Opera on Friday is rich, expansive and revelatory on stage and in the pit. Director and conductor opened up this grim tale of a mistreated soldier, giving its themes a larger canvas and finding heart-stopping beauty in its bleakness."", 
""Berg adapted his libretto from Georg Büchner’s play “Woyzeck,” which he saw at its Vienna premiere in 1914. (The play, left unfinished when Büchner died in 1837, was discovered in 1875, edited, and finally staged in 1913.) In 15 brief scenes, interspersed with orchestral interludes, it recounts the downfall of the impoverished Wozzeck. Taunted by his Captain and experimented on by the unscrupulous Doctor while Marie, his girlfriend and mother of his child, dallies with the handsome Drum-Major, Wozzeck has terrifying apocalyptic visions. Ground down by humiliation and fear, he murders Marie and then drowns himself."", 
""The opera usually takes place in Germany around 1821, the time of the real-life events that inspired the story. Mr. Kentridge has set it just before World War I, making Wozzeck’s visions and the cruelty surrounding him reflect the disintegration of the world order. Sabine Theunissen’s set and Catherine Meyburgh’s projections, ominously lighted by Urs Schönebaum, act like an art installation. Live characters gingerly navigate a rickety pile of platforms, connected by duckboards that suggest the trenches of France. Piled-up wooden chairs are repurposed as weapons or firewood. Wozzeck and Marie’s child is a puppet wearing a gas mask. An actor wearing a field nurse’s apron and a gas mask and carrying a crutch opens the armoire where the Doctor’s experiments take place; in the final scene, the crutch becomes the child’s hobbyhorse."", 
""The cyclorama backdrop and a projection screen that is part of the built set are canvases for Mr. Kentridge’s instantly recognizable black-and-white drawings, rendered in smudgy charcoal and subtly animated so that, for example, giant heads slowly appear on a battlefield as Wozzeck hallucinates them, and figures, including a horse and a pompous officer, strut by. There are blasted towns, barbed wire, a dirigible, a crashed plane, exploding shells and battlefield maps. The images are often suggestive rather than explicit—as when two dancing shadows turn out to be running soldiers who fall after being shot—making the installation’s evocation of chaos and overwhelming dread even stronger."",

Rockefeller and three partners. Such was their drive and ruthlessness that within a decade Standard Oil became a vast monopoly, controlling over 90% of America’s oil refineries. By 1913 Rockefeller was worth $900 million, the equivalent of $23.6 billion today."", ""Standard Oil’s tentacle-like grip on U.S. commerce was finally prized loose in 1911, when the Supreme Court broke it up into 33 separate companies. But this victory didn’t put an end to the nefarious activities surrounding “black gold.” In the 1920s, tycoon Edward Doheny was drawn into the Teapot Dome scandal after he gave a $100,000 bribe to Secretary of the Interior Albert Fall. Doheny served as the inspiration for the corrupt and blood-soaked tycoon J. Arnold Ross in Upton Sinclair’s 1927 novel “Oil!” (which in turned inspired the Oscar-winning 2007 film “There Will Be Blood”)."", 
""Though clearly responsible for a great many evils, oil has also been key to the growth of human civilization. As the Bible attests, bitumen—a naturally forming liquid found in oil sands and pitch lakes—was used in ancient times for waterproofing boats and baskets. It also played an important role in Egyptian burial practices: The word “mummy” is derived from mumiyyah, the Arabic word for bitumen."", ""Over the centuries, oil proved useful in a variety of ways. As early as the fourth century, the Chinese were drilling for oil with bamboo pipes and burning it as heating fuel. In Central Eurasia it was a treatment for mange in camels. By the ninth century, Persian alchemists had discovered how to distill oil into kerosene to make light. The oil fields of medieval Baku, in today’s Azerbaijan, brought trade and culture to the region, rather than political oppression and underdevelopment, as is often the case in oil-rich countries today."", 
""The drilling of the first commercial oil well in the U.S., in Pennsylvania in 1859, brought a raft of benefits. In the 19th century, an estimated 236,000 sperm whales were killed to make oil for lamps. The whaling industry died overnight once Standard Oil began marketing a clean-smelling version of kerosene. Plentiful oil also made the automobile industry possible.

Through the repo market, banks and hedge funds borrow cash overnight, while pledging safe securities such as government bonds as collateral. In September, an unexpected shortage of available cash to lend sparked a surge in the cost of repo-market borrowing, prompting the Fed to intervene for the first time since the financial crisis."", 
""One potential solution is to lend cash directly to smaller banks, securities dealers and hedge funds through the repo market’s clearinghouse, the Fixed Income Clearing Corp., or FICC."", ""Hedge funds currently borrow through a process called sponsored repo, in which they ask a large bank to act as a middleman, pairing their government bonds with money-market funds willing to lend cash. The bank then guarantees that the parties will fulfill their obligations—repaying the cash or returning the securities. Firms trading through the FICC contribute to a fund that would cover a borrower’s default. Critics of the new plan say if the Fed lends cash directly through the clearinghouse, it could end up contributing to a hedge-fund bailout."", 
""The Fed’s aim, according to analysts, is to step back from temporary efforts to quell repo-market volatility and increase financial reserves. After September’s volatility, officials succeeded in suppressing year-end swings with temporary measures, such as offering short-term repo loans and buying Treasury bills."", ""Yet the new approach could also create political problems for policy makers, analysts said. The problem centers on the central bank lending directly to hedge funds, the little-regulated investment vehicles that tend to serve wealthy or institutional investors."", 
""The political backlash that followed crisis-era bank rescues hangs over policy makers’ approach to the current problem, analysts said, even as officials work to ensure the smooth functioning of a key piece of the infrastructure underpinning financial markets. Some fear that lending directly to hedge funds could lead to the perception the Fed is fueling risky bets."", ""How can the Fed best assess its strategy given the presence of hedge funds in the repo market? Join the conversation below."", ""“There’s a strong aversion to fat cat bailouts,” said\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Glenn Havlicek,\n\n\n\n      chief executive of GLMX, which provides technology to repo trading desks."", 
""Many hedge funds trade in the cash market through sponsored repos. The clearinghouse sits between buyers and sellers to ensure that neither party backs out of the transaction. Records of cleared trades also are publicly available, improving the market’s transparency."", ""The idea of using the clearinghouse appeals to some investors and analysts because the Fed has had trouble getting cash into the hands of the smaller banks, securities dealers and investors who need it the most."", ""That is because the Fed trades exclusively with a small group of large banks and securities firms, known as primary dealers. Even among these firms, activity is tightly concentrated. A study recently published by the Bank for International Settlements said that liquidity in the repo market rests in the hands of the four largest banks in the U.S. system."", 
""Though hedge funds are key participants in the market—where they both borrow and lend cash—lending to them directly through the FICC would raise questions about whether the government was backstopping their bets, analysts said."", ""Hedge funds often use borrowed money to increase potential gains from investments, but that strategy can also magnify losses. Policy makers typically haven’t encouraged the use of levered investment strategies. During the financial crisis, many said bets using borrowed money worsened the downturn."", 
""Some investors say the connections between firms involved with sponsored repos make the distinction between lending to one or the other meaningless."", ""Gang Hu,\n\n\n\n      a hedge-fund manager at WinShore Capital Partners, said he borrows cash in the repo market to increase the impact of his investments in Treasury-bond futures and other interest-rate products."", ""“They are reluctant to provide a tool that would allow” overall leverage to increase beyond current levels, Mr. Hu said. “The system cannot work without leverage, but a system with too much leverage is unstable.”"",

People become ill between two and 14 days after infection, or in an average of about 5 days, according to most estimates."", ""Experts say this is helpful for controlling symptoms, which is the mainstay of treating the new coronavirus. But it isn’t a cure and won’t prevent you from infecting others."", ""There have been reports that use of painkillers from a class known as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, containing ingredients like ibuprofen, might worsen Covid-19 infections. Ibuprofen is known to reduce inflammation in the body that may be needed to fight an infection. But the World Health Organization says it doesn’t recommend against the use of ibuprofen. The public health agency said it isn’t aware of evidence on the topic or negative effects in patients from ibuprofen, beyond the usual side effects. It says it is consulting with physicians who are treating patients."", 
""Yes, there are diagnostic tests that you can get through a doctor or hospital, which are the only way to confirm for certain whether a patient has the new coronavirus or another infection. Hundreds of thousands of people have been tested in China and South Korea. In the U.S., testing was limited by problems with a CDC-developed test and narrow testing criteria. Now, more tests are being distributed and the CDC says doctors may decide whether a patient should be tested."", ""Blood tests are being developed and licensed to test people for antibodies to the virus, to determine how many have been infected. Some may not have gotten sick. That test could also show whether people who did get sick are immune from reinfection."", 
""If you are told to self-isolate, you will need to stay at home and avoid contact with others for 14 days. Try not to stay in the same room with others at the same time, the U.K.’s National Health Service recommends. Stay in a well-ventilated room with a window that can be opened. Don’t share towels, utensils or dishes with others, and wash them thoroughly after use. Clean bathrooms and surfaces regularly. Wash your hands before and after contact with pets."", ""Don’t go out to public places; ask family members or friends to get groceries, medicines and other supplies for you. Ask delivery people to leave items outside."", 
""There aren’t any drugs or vaccines approved specifically for the new virus. But more than three dozen are in development or being studied. The first human testing of\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Moderna Inc.’s\n\n\n      experimental vaccine against the virus has begun at the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle. While this first part is starting early, the estimate still is that testing of the vaccine will take a year to 18 months to complete. A few other vaccine makers are developing products targeting the virus."", 
""Two clinical trials in China and one in the U.S. are evaluating remdesivir, an antiviral drug from\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Gilead Sciences Inc.\n\n\n      that was also tested for Ebola. A malaria drug, hydroxychloroquine, has gained attention as a possible treatment, but there is no scientific evidence that it works, experts say."", ""Schools, workplaces and other public gathering places have been closed in many places, and officials are recommending—and in some cases, requiring—that people remain in their homes and away from exposure to other people while the coronavirus continues to spread."", 
""Adults of all ages have been infected, but the risk of severe disease and death is highest for older people and those with other health conditions such as heart disease, chronic lung disease, cancer and diabetes. Most of the 1,023 people whose deaths were included in a study by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention were age 60 or older, and/or had other illnesses. Many patients who have died were admitted to hospitals when their illness was advanced. One large study in China found a mortality rate of 14.8% in people ages 80 and older, and 8% in people ages 70 to 79, compared with a 2.3% mortality rate overall in the population studied."", 
""Few children have been reported with the infection, but that could change. Of the children who were infected in China, only a small proportion were severely ill, according to the WHO. While the disease is mild for teens and younger adults, some have had severe illnesses and died. Of 121 U.S. patients admitted to an intensive care unit, 12% were adults between the ages of 20 and 44, according to a study by the U.S. CDC."", ""Covid-19 has spread rapidly, with cases identified in all 50 states and large outbreaks in some areas. Federal, state and local officials are taking unprecedented steps to try to minimize transmission, such as banning large gatherings and imposing restrictions on movement. Everyone in the U.S. is being advised to adhere to these measures for their own safety and to protect others, particularly those at highest risk."", 
""The number of confirmed cases is substantially lower than the number of actual infections, public-health officials say, because of a shortage of tests and because many people who get infected might not be sick enough to realize it."", ""Public-health officials hope to “flatten the curve” of infections with the social-distancing measures, slowing the spread of the virus so that fewer people are infected. That’s important to keep more people healthy and prevent hospitals from becoming too overwhelmed to care for all of the sick."",

The droplets can also settle on nearby surfaces like a desk, counter or doorknob, where they can survive for a period. A person can become infected by touching a contaminated surface, then touching their mouth, nose or eyes."",

But it degrades quickly, said Vincent Munster, a virologist with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases who led the research."", 
""The study also showed that the virus can survive in small droplets, known as aerosols, for about three hours, though it disintegrates over time. These droplets are small enough to remain suspended in the air for half an hour to an hour, depending on air flow, Dr. Munster said."", ""Wipe down countertops, doorknobs and other commonly touched surfaces frequently. Regular household disinfectant wipes and cleaners kill the virus."", ""Health experts and mask makers say only a properly used reusable N95 respirator mask certified by an independent agency can guard fully against the virus. Surgical masks and even cloth masks can provide some protection, though. The U.S. CDC recommends that people wear cloth masks or face coverings—even a bandanna or scarf will do—in public places like grocery stores where social distancing may be difficult."", 
""Cloth masks or coverings don’t fully protect wearers from becoming infected because they aren’t completely sealed on the face, according to experts. But they can help prevent people who are infected from spreading the virus by catching droplets emitted while exhaling, coughing or sneezing. They shouldn’t be used on children under 2 years old or anyone who has trouble breathing, the CDC says. The CDC asks people to use nonmedical masks because supplies of masks are short and should be saved for health-care workers and caregivers."", 
""The most important thing you can do is wash your hands frequently, for at least 20 seconds each time. Wash them regularly when you are at the office, when you come home, before you eat and other times that you are touching surfaces. You can also use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Don’t touch your eyes, nose or mouth—viruses can enter your body that way. Wipe down objects and surfaces frequently with household cleaner, which will kill the virus. Maintain a distance from people who are sick. Stay about 6 feet or more away from others."", 
""Stock up on some supplies when recommended to stay home, infectious-disease experts say. Items to consider include shelf-stable foods like cans of beans, packages of rice and pasta, and beverages; pain relievers and other common medications; extra prescription medications; and hygiene and cleaning products."", ""The State Department advises U.S. citizens to avoid all travel abroad due to the global impact of Covid-19, and has urged Americans currently abroad to return home immediately. Citizens living abroad are also advised to avoid all international travel. Those who are in countries where outbreaks are occurring should stay home as much as possible, limit contact with others and follow guidelines from the CDC to prevent infection, U.S. authorities say."",

In recent years, they have become a growing player in infectious-disease outbreaks world-wide."",

But the true rate won’t be known until epidemiologists can determine the denominator, meaning how many people have actually been infected. That number will include people who never had symptoms, or had a flulike illness but never got a test for Covid-19."", ""The mortality rate has differed by region, according to a report by an international mission of experts to China led by WHO. The mortality rate was 5.8% in the first several weeks in Wuhan, China, where the epidemic originated. But in other, less hard-hit areas of China, which had more time to prepare to care for patients, it was 0.7%. The rate in China has come down over time, the report said."",

The last two applications were submitted in April and June of 2017.

""The ride-hailing giant has made many changes to the way it works in response to California’s passage of Assembly Bill 5. The law requires companies to treat workers as employees—eligible for sick days and other benefits—rather than independent contractors if they are controlled by their employer and contribute to its usual course of business. Uber has argued that it is a technology platform that connects riders with drivers, not a transportation company, so the drivers aren’t part of its usual course of business."", 
""At least two lawsuits have been filed in federal court alleging that Uber misclassified drivers, citing the law, which took effect Jan. 1. Separately, the lawmaker who wrote AB5 has urged attorneys in some of California’s biggest cities to enforce the statute."", ""The fare test and other recent changes are part of Uber’s effort to strengthen its case that its drivers operate with some degree of independence. Earlier this month, Uber capped its commissions on rides across California. Last month, it allowed drivers in the state to see where riders were going, letting them choose the trips they wanted to take. Previously, drivers agreed to trips without knowing the destination."",

One way to tell is that even moderate Democratic 2020 presidential candidates have quietly proposed to raise the tax rate on labor by double digits and it’s received almost no attention. Unlike single-payer health care and wealth taxes, this tax increase could command majority support in a Democratic Congress on day one."", ""The idea is to increase the Social Security payroll tax, the 12.4% levy that falls directly on labor and is not eligible for deductions. Currently the tax applies to income up to $137,700, split between employer and employee. Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar want to impose it on all labor income above $250,000. Joe Biden wants it to fall on income above $400,000. Pete Buttigieg says he wants “additional Social Security taxes” on income above $250,000."", 
""Meanwhile, Representative John Larson’s Social Security 2100 Act, cosponsored by 208 House Democrats, would apply the tax to income above $400,000 to finance an expansion of the entitlement. The bill would also gradually raise the payroll tax rate on all workers to 14.8% from 12.4%. As entitlement watcher Charles Blahous notes, that’s a 19% increase in the payroll tax burden. That’s significant for less-skilled workers who don’t earn enough or have too many dependents to pay income tax."", 
""Raising rates on high earners may be less politically toxic but it’s terrible economics. Experts can debate how much the top rate affects the incentive to work for, say, a dentist or an engineer, and whether a two, three or five percentage-point tax-rate increase has an effect on the wider economy. But there’s little doubt a new 12.4% tax would depress incentives and reduce America’s competitive advantage for high-skilled workers and make the tax structure more typical of European countries."",

While Chinese authorities struggle to control the epidemic and restart their economy, a world that has grown accustomed to contemplating China’s inexorable rise was reminded that nothing, not even Beijing’s power, can be taken for granted."", ""We do not know how dangerous the new coronavirus will be. There are signs that Chinese authorities are still trying to conceal the true scale of the problem, but at this point the virus appears to be more contagious but considerably less deadly than the pathogens behind diseases such as Ebola or SARS—though some experts say SARS and coronavirus are about equally contagious."", 
""China’s initial response to the crisis was less than impressive. The Wuhan government was secretive and self-serving; national authorities responded vigorously but, it currently appears, ineffectively. China’s cities and factories are shutting down; the virus continues to spread. We can hope that authorities succeed in containing the epidemic and treating its victims, but the performance to date has shaken confidence in the Chinese Communist Party at home and abroad. Complaints in Beijing about the U.S. refusing entry to noncitizens who recently spent time in China cannot hide the reality that the decisions that allowed the epidemic to spread as far and as fast as it did were all made in Wuhan and Beijing."", 
""The likeliest economic consequence of the coronavirus epidemic, forecasters expect, will be a short and sharp fall in Chinese economic growth rates during the first quarter, recovering as the disease fades. The most important longer-term outcome would appear to be a strengthening of a trend for global companies to “de-Sinicize” their supply chains. Add the continuing public health worries to the threat of new trade wars, and supply-chain diversification begins to look prudent."", ""Events like the coronavirus epidemic, and its predecessors—such as SARS, Ebola and MERS—test our systems and force us to think about the unthinkable. If there were a disease as deadly as Ebola and as fast-spreading as coronavirus, how should the U.S. respond? What national and international systems need to be in place to minimize the chance of catastrophe on this scale?"", 
""Epidemics also lead us to think about geopolitical and economic hypotheticals. We have seen financial markets shudder and commodity prices fall in the face of what hopefully will be a short-lived disturbance in China’s economic growth. What would happen if—perhaps in response to an epidemic, but more likely following a massive financial collapse—China’s economy were to suffer a long period of even slower growth? What would be the impact of such developments on China’s political stability, on its attitude toward the rest of the world, and to the global balance of power?"", 
""China’s financial markets are probably more dangerous in the long run than China’s wildlife markets. Given the accumulated costs of decades of state-driven lending, massive malfeasance by local officials in cahoots with local banks, a towering property bubble, and vast industrial overcapacity, China is as ripe as a country can be for a massive economic correction. Even a small initial shock could lead to a massive bonfire of the vanities as all the false values, inflated expectations and misallocated assets implode. If that comes, it is far from clear that China’s regulators and decision makers have the technical skills or the political authority to minimize the damage—especially since that would involve enormous losses to the wealth of the politically connected."", 
""We cannot know when or even if a catastrophe of this scale will take place, but students of geopolitics and international affairs—not to mention business leaders and investors—need to bear in mind that China’s power, impressive as it is, remains brittle. A deadlier virus or a financial-market contagion could transform China’s economic and political outlook at any time."", ""Many now fear the coronavirus will become a global pandemic. The consequences of a Chinese economic meltdown would travel with the same sweeping inexorability. Commodity prices around the world would slump, supply chains would break down, and few financial institutions anywhere could escape the knock-on consequences. Recovery in China and elsewhere could be slow, and the social and political effects could be dramatic."", 
""If Beijing’s geopolitical footprint shrank as a result, the global consequences might also be surprising. Some would expect a return of unipolarity if the only possible great-power rival to the U.S. were to withdraw from the game. Yet in the world of American politics, isolation rather than engagement might surge to the fore. If the China challenge fades, many Americans are likely to assume that the U.S. can safely reduce its global commitments."", ""So far, the 21st century has been an age of black swans. From 9/11 to President Trump’s election and Brexit, low-probability, high-impact events have reshaped the world order. That age isn’t over, and of the black swans still to arrive, the coronavirus epidemic is unlikely to be the last to materialize in China."",

Yes, a headline. Or at least that was the official justification. The truth is that Beijing’s rulers are punishing our reporters so they can change the subject from the Chinese public’s anger about the government’s management of the coronavirus scourge."", 
""“China Is the Real Sick Man of Asia” was the headline over\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Walter Russell Mead’s\n\n\n\n      Feb. 3 column in the Journal. Mr. Mead, a fellow at the Hudson Institute, writes a weekly column on foreign affairs for us. He did not write the headline. Anyone who reads the piece can see it describes the problems in Chinese governance exposed by the response to the coronavirus outbreak. Beijing has since sacked Wuhan province officials, proving Mr. Mead’s point."", 
""As for that headline, we have heard from thoughtful people that to Chinese ears the “sick man” reference echoes in insensitive fashion the West’s exploitation of China in the mid-19th century during the opium wars. Others say it refers to Japan’s 20th-century invasion of China. We take the point, and we were happy to run letters to the editor criticizing the headline."", ""Most Americans, however, understand the phrase in the context of the dying Ottoman Empire as “the sick man of Europe.” That was our historical analogy. These days the “sick man” phrase is used to describe many countries, most notably the Philippines as the sick man of Asia. The Financial Times, the Economist and the Guardian all referred to Britain as “the sick man of Europe” in the throes of Brexit."", 
""The Global Times, a publication that expresses Chinese government views, republished a Reuters article in 2016 whose lead sentence referred to Egypt as the “sick man of the Middle East.” In 2011 Foreign Affairs used the headline “The Sick Man of Asia: China’s Health Crisis” over an article by\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Yanzhong Huang,\n\n\n\n      a professor who grew up in China and graduated from Fudan University."", ""In any event, Mr. Mead’s column and headline were never published in China. That’s because the Journal is banned there. Our website has been shut down since 2014. Our reporters can cover China for the rest of the world but not for Chinese readers."", 
""That didn’t stop the Chinese government from starting a public campaign against the headline. A Foreign Ministry spokesman denounced the column, and several Chinese propaganda organs spread the same theme. “Racism worse enemy than epidemic,” read a headline in Xinhua lumping Mr. Mead’s article with one from Der Spiegel."", ""Our email inbox was soon flooded with complaints about the headline, all containing remarkably similar language and demanding an apology. A campaign was orchestrated to get Mr. Mead barred from\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Twitter.\n\n\n      If you think this was spontaneous outrage, you don’t understand how China’s government works to influence public opinion at home and abroad. Beijing knows how to exploit America’s identity politics to charge “racism” in service of its censorship."", 
""And now China has escalated to ban our three reporters, who had nothing to do with the headline or Mr. Mead’s column. As our readers know, and as we have explained to Chinese officials for years, our news and opinion departments are run independently and have separate reporting lines to the publisher."", ""Election 2020 and the Future of American Politics"", ""Join WSJ Opinion’s Paul Gigot and Kimberley Strassel with guests Marie Harf and Karl Rove as they discuss the upcoming election at the Perot Museum of Nature and Science in Dallas on Tuesday, April 14 at 7 p.m.. Sign up here."", 
""The Chinese understand this but choose to ignore it when it suits their propaganda purposes. In August they refused to renew the press credentials of a Journal reporter who wrote about the business interests of Mr. Xi’s cousin in Australia. This week the excuse for expulsion is an opinion headline. Soon enough it might be a news story about China’s internment camps for Uighurs in Xinjiang or an editorial about Hong Kong."", ""What Chinese officials don’t understand is that a free press would have helped them better cope with the virus fallout. Democracies are resilient because a free media sends signals and information that allow an outlet for grievances and alert leaders to problems before they become crises."", 
""The Chinese also don’t seem to understand that their bullying reduces the shrinking number of allies they still have in the U.S. These columns have supported China’s overall trading relationship with the U.S. even as we criticize some of its trading practices. In the days before Mr. Mead’s column, we ran an editorial (“Wuhan Wilbur Ross”) criticizing the U.S. Commerce Secretary for saying the coronavirus would be an economic benefit for the U.S. Mr. Ross’s point of view will find more American support the more China steals American secrets and banishes reporters."", 
""China’s expulsions are so extreme that they surely have more to do with its domestic politics than American opinion. Perhaps they are also in part a response to the State Department’s decision Tuesday to identify the U.S. operations of state-run Chinese media as foreign missions, which subjects them to the same restrictions as embassies."", ""The coronavirus is a seismic political event that undermines Mr. Xi’s promise to his citizens about a rising China and the competence of the Communist Party. The government’s default defense is to play the nationalist card and blame foreigners for its home-grown troubles. That’s why it censors public complaints on Chinese social media, gins up a furor over a headline—and banishes the best reporters in the world from covering China."",

Just as scientists are confronting an unknown enemy, corporate executives are largely working blind because the coronavirus could cause supply-chain disruptions that are unlike anything we have seen in the past 70 years."", ""For now, the best course of action for companies is to analyze possible outcomes in the context of known supply-chain risks based on historical precedents, and to take precautionary measures that minimize exposure to future disruptions."", 
""Predictions regarding the impact of the virus range from dire to optimistic. Pessimists draw parallels with the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, which killed tens of millions of people world-wide, and the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. On the other side, optimists foresee an epidemic akin to a typical flu outbreak that will run its course."", ""Top news and in-depth analysis on the world of logistics, from supply chain to transport and technology."", ""From a supply-chain perspective, the disruptions associated with past crises such as the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, that swept across Asia; the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster; or the 2011 Thailand floods are not a good yardstick for the current epidemic. Those events shook specific companies for a relatively short time, but the impact of the coronavirus could be much more sustained."", 
""Moreover, the virus formally known as Covid-19 is affecting both supply and demand, so the potential threats are graver than those earlier disruptions. This is especially true because of China’s growth since the SARS crisis as a manufacturing powerhouse and as a major consumer market."", ""Today’s supply chains are global and more complex than they were in 2003. Not only are Chinese factories affected by lockdowns and quarantines, production sites in other countries already are running low on parts for products assembled in China. For example,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Apple Inc.\n\n\n      works with suppliers in 43 countries, all of which receive components from Apple’s contract manufacturers in China."", 
""To understand which companies in supply chains are the most vulnerable, one has to understand the so-called supply-chain bullwhip effect."", ""“\n        The most vulnerable companies are small and leveraged suppliers upstream in the supply chain that are in danger of going under.\n        ”"", ""Assume, for instance, that a retailer experiences an X% drop in demand for a product. It surmises that future sales will be lower too, and so concludes that its current inventories are too high. So the retailer cuts its orders to the wholesaler by twice the amount of the drop in demand. The wholesaler sees that cut in its orders and, using the same logic, cuts the orders to the manufacturer by double that amount, or four times less than the retailer’s drop in demand. The manufacturer reduces its orders to parts suppliers by even more, and so on."", 
""At each level of the supply chain the decline in demand sparks a bigger decline in orders from suppliers. Each company reasons that they need to quickly cut production to adjust to declining sales and work off their now-bloated inventory. The most vulnerable companies are small and leveraged suppliers upstream in the supply chain that are in danger of going under."", ""Then-Ford Motor Co. Chief Executive\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Alan Mulally\n\n\n\n      tried to mitigate the impending bullwhip during the 2008 financial crisis by imploring U.S. lawmakers to save his competitors. He argued that if automotive Tier 1 suppliers failed, then their suppliers would also fail, and so on, affecting the entire U.S. automobile industry."", 
""When demand revives, the bullwhip pattern reverses as each echelon boosts ordering, both to cover expected higher sales and to quickly replenish depleted inventories. The reverse bullwhip of oscillating orders and inventories strains the ability of production and logistics operations to keep up. After a period during which many upstream suppliers fail and remaining companies fail to deliver during the recovery, a multinational enterprise may find it easier to leave China and set up manufacturing elsewhere."", 
""Faced with so many unknowns, companies should take sensible “just in case” steps to prepare for the effects of the coronavirus."", ""1. Set up a central emergency management center. At this point it can be virtual but should include a clear roster of participants with clear decision-making rules in case of a pandemic."", ""2. Review the company’s product portfolio and the customer base in order to set priorities. If capacity is reduced, there will need to be rules for which products should be built and which customers should be supplied first."", 
""3. Review suppliers. Who makes critical parts? Are there alternate sources? What is the suppliers’ inventory status?"", ""4. Plan for operating to maximize cash flow rather than profits."", ""5. Maintain communications with federal and local authorities, as well as Chinese and other Southeast Asian friends and colleagues on the ground."", ""Hoping for the best while preparing for the worst may not seem like a rigorous business approach to the crisis.

Dressed in her Sunday finest, she fills a bag of groceries at the local market and at the last moment, as though it had slipped her mind, adds a 12-pack of lager. Then, feigning surprise that she can’t afford the bill, she puts all the food back on the shelves. It doesn’t matter that the shopkeeper has seen the charade dozens of times, or that Agnes’s benders are notorious throughout her Glasgow neighborhood. “Every day with the make-up on and her hair done, she climbed out of her grave and held her head high,” Mr. Stuart writes. “When she had disgraced herself with drink, she got up the next day, put on her best coat, and faced the world.”"", 
""That world is Glasgow in the 1980s, a city “losing its purpose” amid the shuttering of its manufacturing industries. Agnes’s worthless tomcatting husband has run off and she lives with her three kids on the crumbs of weekly disability checks in a rundown housing scheme in the city’s northern mining district. The older children escape when they can, leaving behind Shuggie, whom Agnes has molded from infancy into a companion, apologist and enabler, the sole person who will endure her alcoholism forever."", 
""Titling the novel after Shuggie rather than the woman who dominates him seems like small gesture of defiance on Mr. Stuart’s part. Shuggie is a pariah twice over, both because of his allegiance to his mother and because of the effeminate tendencies that single him out to bullies and sexual predators."", ""Both are legion in the novel’s unvarnished characterization of Glasgow’s slums, where a brutal, caveman masculinity has developed in proportion to how trapped and useless the men have become. If the portrayal is unsparing, it is also familial, because Mr. Stuart vividly inhabits the city’s singular “Weegie” dialect and vocabulary. When Agnes first moves to the housing project she assumes that most of the neighboring women are tying one on by midday as well. “No, hen, we’re drinking piss-cold tea,” one says scoldingly. “It’s only ye who’s neckin’ vodka like it was tap water.”"", 
""But most of all, “Shuggie Bain” is a novel of addiction, and as is the way with addicts, Agnes belligerently demands the bulk of the book’s attention. There is a powerful, if wearying, consistency in her perpetual relapses, her outrageous lies and public spectacles, as well as in Shuggie’s thwarted attempts to get out from under her. It’s the obstinate Bain pride that prevents this novel from becoming a wallow in victimhood and gives it its ruined dignity. Agnes will suffer any humiliation for a drink, but she’ll give you an earful at the first suggestion of pity."",

""The chat was partly designed to encourage customers to find a better plan that they might not have been aware of before signing off for good, according to\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Lauren Cowher\n\n\n\n      Hill, director of global customer experience at ClassPass."", ""But the company is rolling out technology to automate its cancellation process, Ms. Cowher Hill said, with the goal of making it available to all global consumers in the coming months."", ""“We know the ability to pause or make changes to a membership is something our members deeply value,” Ms. Cowher Hill said. “And this isn’t just true for ClassPass. Globally, there is a growing desire for a frictionless cancellation flow, especially for subscription services, and we’re proud to be making strides to deliver that.”"", 
"""", ""ClassPass is using what it learned from the live chat process to inform its automated cancellation system, she said."", ""Many companies have used onerous policies and processes to keep customers past trial periods and discourage them from canceling later, according to Robbie Kellman Baxter, a consultant specializing in membership models and subscription pricing and author of a forthcoming book, “The Forever Transaction: How to Build a Subscription Model So Compelling, Your Customers Will Never Want to Leave.” But that isn’t a winning long-term strategy, she said."",

It changed its policy that December to allow cancellation online."",

It previously required members to call or email a “Membership Concierge,” which had drawn complaints for sometimes replying slowly."", ""The company made the change to make things easier for members, but a representative noted another benefit as well: It lightened inbound calls to the customer service team."", ""Easy cancellation policies could actually help businesses lure in more subscribers and encourage more customers to come back if they have left, said Peter Fader, a professor of marketing at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. Such policies, he says, make the subscription experience more personal by making customers feel fairly treated."", 
""That could help the subscription companies’ broader efforts to make recurring shipments and automatic charges feel less transactional and more like membership in a club."", ""Harry’s Inc., the subscription razor service that also sells products in retail stores, last May launched what it describes as a “core membership” program that costs $15 a year, giving customers discounts when they shop online as well as free engravings and access to limited-edition products. It started the program because customer feedback indicated a desire for specialized services, according to\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Kalpana Ganti,\n\n\n\n      head of digital product at Harry’s."", 
""The company has converted 57% of subscribers to its basic monthly plan to the new membership program, Ms. Ganti said."", ""Harry’s said customers can cancel either through Harrys.com—by clicking a button on their profile—or by getting in touch with the customer support team via phone or email."", ""Personalized services and other membership touches help companies connect with customers who are increasingly subscribing instead of making individual purchases, said\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Tien Tzuo,\n\n\n\n      founder and CEO of Zuora Inc., a provider of software for subscription companies. Companies that offer membership services are trying to project a broader lifestyle that will appeal to customers and add value beyond the product itself, Mr. Tzuo said."", 
""Brightly marked, easy exits could become an essential feature of membership models, according to\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Greg Alvo,\n\n\n\n      founder and CEO of the subscription software company OrderGroove Inc. His company’s clients include\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        GNC Holdings Inc.,\n\n\n      which upgraded its interface last May to make it easier for customers to modify or cancel their subscriptions."", ""Making quitting simple could even become the law. A 2018 California regulation began requiring companies that let consumers subscribe online to also let them opt out online. “We think this is a precursor to more consumer protections to come,” said\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Guy Marion,\n\n\n\n      chief executive officer and co-founder at Brightback Inc., which offers automated customer retention software for subscription companies."",

Seeming to come from nowhere in the waning days of World War I, it spread through a war-ravaged world like wildfire. In a matter of months, a third of the world’s population was infected, 50 to 100 million people died, and the global economy shrank by 5%."", ""The world of 1918 was very different from today’s, where the new coronavirus is emerging as another potential pandemic. A century ago, antibiotics, modern hospitals, intensive care units and instant communication did not exist; most people lived in rural communities; intercontinental travel took weeks rather than hours. Now the world’s population is four times larger, with more than half living in urban areas. National economies are heavily intertwined because of globalization. Health services are highly sophisticated in wealthy countries, though their quality varies greatly in the rest of the world."",

Both were previously unknown viral strains for which there was no existing vaccine or proven medical treatment.

In 1918, Philadelphia was one of the hardest-hit American cities, partly because it was, as the muckraker Lincoln Steffens put it, “the worst-governed city in America.” In his book “The Great Influenza,” the historian John M. Barry describes the efforts of Dr. Wilmer Krusen, director of Philadelphia’s Public Health and Charities department, a well-intentioned man who lacked public health experience and was prone to inaction. On Sep. 28, 1918, he allowed the city to proceed with a Liberty Loan parade to sell millions of dollars in war bonds, despite warnings that the event would spread illness. The parade drew 200,000 people; within 72 hours, every bed in the city’s 31 hospitals was filled."", 
""By contrast, Mr. Barry shows, St. Louis had the most success of any large American city in fighting the pandemic. Dr. Max Starkloff, the city’s health commissioner, said that his goal was to “keep the epidemic out of the city, if possible, and if that fails, to use every means to keep it down to the lowest possible number of cases.” He created an advisory body that included representatives of the city’s chamber of commerce, schools, medical society, university, Red Cross and local public health services. He pursued what he called “intelligent citizen cooperation” through active outreach to the community. And he engaged health department staff, policy makers and teachers to implement individual quarantines and bans on public gatherings. Thanks to Starkloff’s rapid, inclusive and systematic efforts, St. Louis’s mortality rate from the flu was half of Philadelphia’s."",

She was on the verge of a breakdown."", ""She’d been working nonstop for days at the center of China’s coronavirus outbreak, where she is a doctor. Both of her parents had Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, as did many of her colleagues. The number of sick and dying was climbing. And on this day, Dr. Zhang had forgotten about her 9-year-old daughter, who was home alone and scared—and who, at that moment, wasn’t picking up the phone."", 
""Dr. Zhang’s eyes welled up, but she had no energy to cry. “My tears wouldn’t flow,” she said in an interview on Feb. 18."", ""Around the world, doctors are being stretched to the limit. Short on supplies and sleep, they’re being asked to stop a global pandemic that no one fully understands. Adding to that strain, they’re risking their own health while they diagnose cases and attend to sick patients—along with the health of their spouses, children and other close family members."", ""With the virus now growing more quickly outside China than inside, it’s a problem other countries will increasingly face."", 
""In China, more than 3,000 doctors have been infected, according to official data, and at least 22 have died. Some medical professionals believe the numbers are even higher, adding uncertainty for doctors elsewhere confronting the virus. Untold numbers of family members have fallen ill."", ""Chinese doctors are working shifts of 10 hours or more. Many stay in the same hazmat suits the entire time, without food, water or bathroom breaks. Disrobing to eat or go to the bathroom could risk exposure. Medical workers are requesting psychological help to try to deal with the stress."", 
""Infectious-disease doctors around the world are trained to handle highly contagious illnesses, and know the risks. But the current outbreak is spreading so quickly that it’s forcing hospitals to deploy staff with limited experience in infectious diseases and, sometimes, insufficient gear to keep them safe. Some hospitals can’t find enough staff willing to take on the risk."", ""In South Korea, some nurses and support staff quit when the outbreak spread, their families begging them to resign. Iran has faced equipment shortages while its deputy health minister—himself a surgeon—has been infected with the virus."", 
""Doctors in China say conditions have improved significantly since the early days of the outbreak. Roughly 42,000 medical staff from around the country have descended upon Wuhan and the surrounding Hubei province to provide relief. That includes around 4,000 military doctors in one of China’s largest-ever mobilizations of military medical resources."", ""Wuhan has 53,000 beds in hospitals and temporary medical and quarantine facilities for treating patients with the coronavirus, with a goal of adding 17,000 more, according to an official media briefing on Feb. 20. Crowds and lines at fever wards have subsided as the rate of infections has slowed. Yet around 100 new cases are still emerging in Hubei province every day.

""Liu Fan,\n\n\n\n      a 59-year-old nurse at Wuhan Wuchang Hospital, one of the main coronavirus crisis centers in Wuhan, died from the virus even though she wasn’t working in a fever ward, according to a Weibo post by the hospital.

He worried their immunities would decline."", 
""On Jan. 24, a chest scan showed he had a serious infection himself; he later tested positive for the virus. As Dr. Liu lay in intensive care, he kept fielding calls and asking about patients, while colleagues grew more anxious."", ""“I’m worried I can’t do anything,” Dr. Liu texted them, according to an account in official Chinese media.

She asked him to call her every day at 2 p.m. to reassure her he was OK. She reminded him to breathe oxygen and not be afraid."", 
""On Feb. 18, Dr. Liu died. A colleague sobbed while telling the media: “We really wanted to give him a farewell, but we had so much work to do.”"", ""Many of the heaviest burdens are falling on younger doctors and nurses, who are seen as better suited for high-risk situations, because of their stronger immune systems."", ""One doctor,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Peng Yinhua,\n\n\n\n      died at just 29 years old, according to state media.

Both doctors’ wives were pregnant."", 
""Dr. Zhang, who worried about her 9-year-old daughter and sick parents, was more prepared for the crisis than most. A radiologist at Zhongnan Hospital, a 3,300-bed facility overlooking a lake in central Wuhan, she had served on the front lines of SARS in 2003, as well as after China’s deadly Sichuan earthquake in 2008."", ""On Dec. 31, Dr. Zhang was on her first day of vacation and planning to take a trip with her parents and daughter to their hometown in Inner Mongolia. That morning, her superiors called, ordering her to attend an emergency meeting."", 
""Two patients at Zhongnan had lung infections reminiscent of SARS. Word was spreading among staff that a mysterious illness was sweeping through a seafood market on the west side of town."", ""At the meeting, hospital officials issued new guidelines for staff to disinfect their spaces, unlock windows to ensure circulation of fresh air, and begin wearing goggles and other protection in some areas."", ""Dr. Zhang’s colleagues had asked her to consult on the two patients’ X-rays, and she was worried about what she saw. She warned colleagues that if a virus had spread from animals to humans, then human-to-human transmission would be easy."", 
""She also spoke to the hospital’s Communist Party secretary to explain her fear of another epidemic. Some people thought she was being alarmist, she says."", ""With the hospital short on supplies, Dr. Zhang made homemade masks out of gauze for her parents and daughter, just like she’d learned to do during SARS. The family canceled their holiday."", ""A few days later, a technician in the imaging department discovered he had been infected. Sick patients began pouring in. Soon dozens of staff were sick at Zhongnan, and other Wuhan hospitals, as well."", 
""Most days, Dr. Zhang reviewed chest X-rays, a relatively low-risk job. Some days, she’d don a hazmat suit and tend to patients herself."", ""Worried she might bring the virus back home, and overloaded with work, she began sleeping on an office sofa. She barely had time to eat and shower."", ""She figured her parents, who lived in her home, could take care of her daughter. Her husband was living and working hundreds of miles away and unable to join them after authorities announced a strict quarantine of Wuhan in late January."", 
""Then Dr. Zhang’s 69-year-old mother admitted to feeling sick. Dr. Zhang convinced her parents to get tested for the virus. For her mother’s first visit to the hospital, Dr. Zhang had her meet nearby, so her mother could put on protective gear before going in."", ""Both parents came up negative using the nucleic acid test, a finicky diagnostic tool test that regularly produced false negatives. Their CT scans told a different story."", ""“When I saw it, I knew,” Dr. Zhang said, recalling her mother’s first chest scan. “My heart sank.” Her father, who had been reluctant to get tested, had a lung infection that turned out to be even worse, though he showed no obvious symptoms at the time."", 
""All along, the family worried about the youngest member, Dr. Zhang’s daughter. Dr. Zhang had been too scared to check her daughter, until the girl volunteered. “Scan me! It’ll be OK,” she said."", ""Her lungs were normal."", ""Still, Dr. Zhang was facing a crisis. Her husband was away, her parents were sick and contagious, and she was needed at the hospital. There was no one to take care of her daughter, whose school was closed."", ""Dr. Zhang planted her in the family’s living room with instructions to look after herself—and to stay away from her grandparents, who quarantined themselves in other rooms."", 
""The 9-year-old learned how to heat up canned congee, placing it at each grandparent’s door."", ""As her parents’ conditions worsened, Dr. Zhang struggled to get them admitted to a hospital. Beds were limited and authorities were unwilling to make arrangements for people whose nucleic acid tests had come back negative."", ""With help from a colleague, Dr. Zhang got hold of some medicine, including antiretroviral medication for HIV that researchers are testing as a treatment for the coronavirus. Her parents suffered side effects, including nausea."", 
""Then, 10 quarantine spots opened up for family of Zhongnan Hospital staff, in an empty building slated for demolition. Dr. Zhang raced to grab a number to reserve a spot, while a colleague ran to guard two beds inside."", ""The new location wasn’t designed to provide any medical treatment, but getting a room for her parents was a relief for Dr. Zhang. Although authorities had publicly announced there were no more beds there, scores of people had gathered there anyway, desperate to get space."", ""“Some people were clutching their stomach, others holding their heads and others coughing uncontrollably,” said Dr. Zhang. Her heart broke."", 
""After the chaos that day, she suddenly remembered her daughter back home. She tried calling and pulled over her car. She was overwhelmed with feelings of guilt and hopelessness."", ""It took a moment for her to calm herself down. She told herself: “It would be a disaster for the family if I couldn’t pull it together.”"", ""Arriving home, Dr. Zhang pushed open the door to find the lights out."", ""In a panic, she called out for her daughter. A faint voice replied from the dark as her daughter stirred from a nap. She had been hungry without food at home, and had little energy to do anything but lie down and sleep."", 
""Her daughter ate the meal her mother had brought, pleading for things to be different. She asked why her mother had to be at work all the time."", ""“I was afraid to be alone at home today,” Dr. Zhang’s daughter told her."", ""Dr. Zhang felt terrible but tried to coax her daughter to understand. “You need to grow up,” she said. “If you don’t grow up, Mom will be even more worried.”"", ""What’s the best way to support health-care workers? Join the conversation below."", ""Eventually, her daughter said, “Mom is so strong, I’ll be too,” though she admitted she was still scared. Dr. Zhang tucked her daughter in for the night, letting her watch cartoons from her bed."", 
""Dr. Zhang knew then she needed to find some way for her husband to join her in Wuhan. The couple applied for special permission from the government; two days later, he got approval to drive the roughly 14-hour journey into the city."", ""On Feb. 3, Dr. Zhang took to her social messaging account to call for the use of chest X-rays in diagnosing Covid-19, instead of lab tests that were resulting in so many false negatives. She raised the alarm on cross-infection within families, recommending the government make use of hotels and school dormitories to quarantine suspected cases."", 
""Speaking up was no small risk for Dr. Zhang, who went back and forth over whether to post the night before. Even Dr. Zhang’s friends were worried about her post, she said. Authorities had detained people for speaking up about the outbreak in its early days."", ""The next day, China’s National Health Commission incorporated the use of chest scans in diagnoses in Hubei province. Days later, authorities reclassified more than 13,000 suspected instances of the virus as confirmed cases. That meant many more patients could have a better chance of access to treatment, including hospital beds and quarantine locations as they opened up."", 
""Friends sent screenshots of the good news to Dr. Zhang. She worried about a shortage of CT scanners and called up manufacturers that could produce portable machines. She helped coordinate with staff at other facilities to ensure they had enough equipment and technicians."", ""For Dr. Zhang, the outbreak has felt never-ending. Her hospital oversees three separate coronavirus facilities with 5,400 beds."", ""At its own campus, Zhongnan worked to add 2,000 new beds, up from a few hundred for coronavirus patients previously. With their offices being repurposed for patients, Dr. Zhang and her colleagues moved into a hotel, where they work and sleep."", 
""Dr. Zhang believes it will take months for hospitals to work through all the infected patients. Letting down their guard could lead to a resurgence in cases."", ""One night, Dr. Zhang returned to her hotel carrying half a dozen lunch boxes for her colleagues. She says her back felt like it would split in two, and she had developed a persistent cough."", ""A hotel security guard checked Dr. Zhang’s temperature and asked her to log what time she entered the building. She had completely lost track of time."", 
""“I’m fine,” she said, as the guard raised a thermometer to her forehead. It was normal."", ""“If we fail, what happens to you all?” she said, walking away."", """", ""Copyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

This would be in addition to continuing to provide ample funding for medical research, testing, prevention and treatment. The stimulus’s total cost would be about $350 billion, but could be larger or smaller depending on how the economic situation unfolds. Congress should design it to be accelerated, big, comprehensive and dynamic."", ""• Accelerated. In normal times it takes a year or more for monetary policy to have its maximum economic impact. The Federal Reserve made a bold and correct move with its 50-basis-point rate cut, but no one knows how well or quickly it will work."", 
""Most likely, the lower interest rates and depreciated dollar will provide only modest relief after a substantial lag. Fiscal policy can act much more quickly by getting money into people’s hands within weeks or months."", ""• Big. The economy faces an unusual degree of uncertainty around several factors: the fatality and transmission rates of the virus, the timing of a vaccine, the direct and indirect economic effects of the epidemic, and the difficulty of making economic policy in a low-interest-rate environment experiencing an unusual shock to both supply and demand."", 
""Amid uncertainty, policy makers must weigh the risks of overreacting against the risks of underreacting. The likelihood that history judges the economic response to coronavirus as too little and too late is much higher than the converse. If the economic shock is small and stimulus proves to be unnecessary, its negative effects are likely to be small. But if the shock is bigger and policy makers fail to act now, it will be harder to reverse the economic damage.

Death rates for some older people have also been higher than they are for the overall population in a large outbreak in South Korea."",

It’s important to stay socially connected even if physical connection is limited. Connecting by phone or video with older relatives who are alone is a good idea, he says."",

""Many employees, meanwhile, are wondering just how far their bosses have to go to protect them from the outbreak’s spread, and what calls go too far."", ""To better understand what is permissible—and required—in confronting a public-health crisis in the workplace, The Wall Street Journal consulted employment lawyers and other workplace experts. The answers often lie somewhere in the murky balance between the Americans with Disabilities Act, or ADA, which aims to safeguard individuals’ privacy, and Occupational Safety and Health Administration standards, designed to protect workers’ safety. But the body of labor rules and regulations suggest it’s wise to stick to the following guidelines, the experts say."", 
""Here are answers to some of the most common questions from employees:"", ""Can my employer cancel my vacation time and make me work instead?"", ""In most workplaces, yes. Vacation time isn’t guaranteed under federal law, and most employers are within their rights to cancel a vacation and require workers to return to the job, says\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Kenneth G. Dau-Schmidt,\n\n\n\n      a professor of labor and employment law at Indiana University Bloomington. The exception is if an employee is covered by a union contract or specific employment agreement that includes certain time-off protections, he says."", 
""Still, most bosses know that pulling a vacation is bound to be an unpopular move, a reason many are loath to do it unless an emergency requires it. “People can get upset if vacations are canceled,” Prof. Dau-Schmidt says. “That would be the major limit on it.”"", ""What if my boss tells me to cancel my personal travel plans. Is that legal?"", ""Employers can’t dictate how you spend your personal time, even if they do make a recommendation against travel to certain regions, says\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Roberta Matuson,\n\n\n\n      an executive coach and author of “Evergreen Talent: A Guide to Hiring and Cultivating a Sustainable Workforce.”"", 
""Does the company have to pay for a canceled trip?"", ""If a boss insists on an employee cutting a trip, go ahead and ask for reimbursement. Some employers will see that as a reasonable request. But legally, they aren’t required to pay unless an employment contract specifically calls for it, Mr. Dau-Schmidt says."", ""I really feel uncomfortable about commuting into work and increasing my risk of exposure. Do I have the right to work from home?"", ""Employers generally don’t have an obligation to allow telecommuting, says\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Mitch Boyarsky,\n\n\n\n      a labor and employment lawyer with Nelson Mullins Riley & Scarborough LLP. An exception is an employee who qualifies under the ADA to work remotely to accommodate a disability. Another might be if the government is ordering a quarantine, other lawyers say. Then an employer could have more of a burden to allow remote work."", 
""I feel totally fine and don’t think I’m at risk, but my boss is insisting I work from home. Do I have to?"", ""Yes. Employers are within their rights to ask employees to work remotely, as long as they’re not applying a policy in a way that could be deemed discriminatory, says\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Angela B. Cornell,\n\n\n\n      a clinical professor at Cornell Law School and director of the school’s Labor Law Clinic."", ""For example, it’s OK to ask workers who have recently traveled to China, Italy, Iran or another country especially hard hit by the outbreak to work from home for a given period. But it’s not all right to ask workers over the age of 70 to work from home—even if the intentions are well-meaning—because age is a protected class under federal law."", 
""My employer has requested that I work from home. Does that mean they can order me not to run errands or go to church?"", ""While your boss can ask you not to come into the office, they can’t bar you from going to other places or, say, hopping on the subway. That said, your employer can offer recommendations on how much to venture from home, says Heather Bussing, an employment lawyer in Sonoma County, Calif., with Rybicki & Associates PC."", ""“You can educate and you can encourage, but you can’t control,” she says of employers."", 
""My job requires me to have a lot of close contact with many customers. Am I protected if I say I can’t perform my job because of the outbreak?"", ""Workers are protected from retaliation from an employer if they refuse to take on what they consider an unsafe work assignment, says\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Howard Mavity,\n\n\n\n      an Atlanta-based partner in the workplace-safety practice of law firm Fisher & Phillips LLP. He advises employers to listen carefully to employee concerns. “You can’t discipline someone for complaining about safety,” he says."", 
""It becomes less straightforward, though, if a “reasonable” employee would otherwise deem the assignment safe, Mr. Mavity says. If a hotel housekeeper, for example, has received the necessary training to protect against Covid-19, along with proper gloves and equipment, it may not be considered reasonable to refuse to clean a hotel room. “That wouldn’t really be protected,” he says."", ""If a hotel is known to be housing guests with Covid-19, it’s a different story, and housekeepers might be able to refuse the assignment, he says."", 
""Do I have to take that business trip?"", ""Minnesota employment lawyer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Kate Bischoff\n\n\n\n      says your boss can require you to go on a business trip."", ""“There can be the ultimatum that you have to go on this or you can lose your job,” she says."", ""Her advice for workers: Come up with a strong case for how technology could make a virtual meeting effective. For employers, she urges caution. “Making such an ultimatum is going to spread like wildfire through your organization,” she says, prompting lots of workers to rethink their ties to the company. “It is a strategic mistake.”"", 
""It could also be a legal mistake, depending on the circumstances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Daniel Schwartz,\n\n\n\n      a partner with law firm Shipman & Goodwin who mainly represents Connecticut employers, points to a case in Connecticut where the court indicated it could be illegal to require a worker to travel somewhere unsafe."", ""Can my employer take my temperature at work?"", ""The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission says that, according to the Americans with Disabilities Act, measuring an employee’s temperature generally is considered a medical examination, and usually beyond the bounds of what an employer can do or require. But in an especially severe or widespread influenza outbreak, such a check is permissible. That rule is likely to apply to a coronavirus epidemic as well."", 
""But even if it’s legal to take an employee’s temperature, many lawyers and health experts don’t think it’s useful. “Maybe they have the flu,” Mr. Schwartz says of employees with elevated temperatures. And health officials have said many people with the coronavirus have had no fever."", ""What if I end up catching Covid-19 at work? Is my employer liable?"", ""Unlikely—because it’s usually hard to prove. If an employee suffers an injury on the job, such as slipping or falling, then the worker is often entitled to workers’ compensation, which can cover certain medical care and lost wages, says Ms. Cornell."", 
""But with the coronavirus, it could be tough to determine exactly where someone contracted the virus, making it difficult to hold an employer responsible for medical costs. Generally, a staffer must prove that the disease was caused by “conditions peculiar to the work” and there were no other opportunities for exposure, according to guidance by Fisher & Phillips to employers."", ""My employer knew a co-worker contracted the virus but didn’t inform the rest of staff right away. Weren’t they required to?"", 
""Generally, yes. Companies have an obligation to warn those who may have come in contact with someone diagnosed with Covid-19, says Ms. Cornell. Local health authorities may also want the public to know."", ""But it’s highly unlikely a company would identify the employee in question by name. That could violate confidentiality requirements under the ADA, Mr. Mavity says."", ""Instead, employers are more likely to note that a staffer on a certain floor or part of the building contracted the virus. “It will take about a 12th of a second for everyone to know you’re talking about Joe, but you don’t say Joe,” Mr. Mavity says."", 
""If I come down with Covid-19, do I have to tell my employer? Can’t I just say I need to take sick time and leave it at that?"", ""There may not be a legal requirement, but there is an ethical one, Ms. Matuson says. If you work in an office or interact with colleagues in person, it’s a good idea to alert your company to your diagnosis so managers can tell others."", ""If you work remotely and have had no direct contact with colleagues, clients or other people through your job, though, such a disclosure may not be necessary, Ms. Matuson says. “I would just say, ‘I’m not feeling well,’ ” she says."",

The semiautonomous city had fewer than 20 confirmed cases in early February, but they were enough to trigger closures of government offices, tourist hot spots and many public facilities. Dow Jones, the parent company of The Wall Street Journal, followed government advisories and closed its Hong Kong, Shanghai and Beijing offices for a month. Employees were told to work from home and avoid congregating."", 
""It is an experience many in the U.S. are now facing, to one degree or another: sudden school and office closures, event cancellations, shortages of toilet paper and cleaning supplies, and fears about being exposed to the contagious respiratory virus. Parents are worrying about how they’ll manage child care and remote-work arrangements, and how long all this could last. And we are all learning that we will have to be very adaptable for the foreseeable future."", ""Living under the new restrictions meant spending a lot of time at home—and making it serve as an office and a school, as well as a living space. It wasn’t an ideal fit: a 650-square-foot, two-bedroom flat, a cluttered space shared by two adults, two rambunctious boys and a cat."", 
""The children initially cheered upon learning about the school closures, thinking that meant an extended holiday. We all sighed when the American international school my sons attend said that virtual lessons would be conducted over the course of each school day."", ""There would be live teaching via Google Hangouts, assignments that students had to complete in set time frames, and online music, art and physical-education classes. Parents were told to download education and reading apps and were given links to folders with slide presentations, video recordings, online meetings and numerous worksheets."", 
""My sons—ages 5 and 7—couldn’t take part in live lessons concurrently from our single family computer, so I went out and bought an iPad and a printer. At the shop, a salesman said he had sold more than a dozen printers that same day “to people just like you, who have kids that will be schooling at home.”"", ""Then there was the question of workspace. With no space for study desks in the bedrooms, the children have been using the dining table, couch and coffee tables for virtual school lessons on weekdays."", 
""Initially, I thought I could set up my work laptop in a common area in my apartment complex with tables and chairs after cleaning them with disinfecting wipes—but that venue was also closed by the building’s management"", ""On the first day of virtual school, I felt my stress level rising as my kids called out for me to help them as I tried to answer emails and messages from work. “Leave them to me,” said my husband, a full-time dad, and I left the apartment to find an alternative venue. I texted a co-worker and asked if I could come to her flat to work. She obliged, though I felt like I was contravening office rules about working remotely and worried that I might unknowingly infect her if I caught the virus on the subway en route to her home."", 
""As a stopgap measure, my company rented two small rooms in a hostel and set up screens and workstations for staffers who couldn’t work from home. I spent several days there, before the rooms were abruptly closed when Hong Kong’s health authorities said there was a confirmed coronavirus case in a nearby building."", ""I eventually found another location—the studio apartment of another co-worker who was out of the country. It was a quiet respite from my home, but hunching over a small laptop and working in isolation for days on end, with contact with co-workers limited to emails and phone calls, brought its own difficulties. Many, including myself, struggled with concentration and the lack of face-to-face interactions. We organized several online group meetings so that people could share experiences and stay in touch with each other."", 
""I also felt guilty that my spouse was shouldering the burden of getting the children through their schoolwork, so I stayed in some mornings to help. But trying to get a 5-year-old to sit in front of a screen and watch his teacher talk for more than 10 minutes is a challenge in itself. One day, I let him paint a picture while he listened passively to a 45-minute online music lesson (we turned off the iPad camera so that the teacher couldn’t see him)."", ""With libraries, gyms, museums, theme parks and most sports facilities closed, in our leisure time we have been going hiking, hanging out at the beach and cycling in the sun. We still eat at our favorite restaurants on weekends. I carry hand sanitizer and wipes everywhere, but have accepted that I can’t keep all our hands clean all the time. (My children have also refused to wear masks, complaining they are uncomfortable.)"", 
""We’ve had to make other adjustments. When food and cleaning supplies were in short supply in stores last month, I bought a half-liter bottle of hand sanitizer from a neighbor who had stocked up on it during a work trip in Finland. My husband went to the supermarket every few days at its 8 a.m. opening time to buy rice, toilet paper and wipes before panic buyers came and cleared the shelves. During this period, my second-grader had to use “scrounge” in a sentence for phonics class. He wrote: “I have to scrounge for T.P.!”"", 
""(That turned into a delicate subject. I gave a few rolls of toilet paper to co-workers who were unable to buy them. One gave me Purell wipes that she had bought from\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Amazon.com\n\n\n      in return.)"", ""Dow Jones partially reopened its Hong Kong and China offices at the beginning of March, bringing back a sense of normalcy for staffers. Employees have to use a sign-up sheet to reserve spots, go through daily temperature checks at the office reception, and wash or sanitize their hands upon arrival."", 
""The earliest date Hong Kong schools will reopen is April 20. The city likely has to go through at least 14 days without a new coronavirus infection before the government will let students and teachers congregate again. That has yet to happen; Hong Kong this week reported more than a dozen new infections, raising its total cases to around 130. Friends who lived in Hong Kong during the 2003 SARS epidemic predict that schools won’t reopen until the next academic year begins in August. It is a prospect I dread, but we will probably go on doing what we’re doing."", 
""As our new normal has set in, I’ve learned to appreciate the small freedoms we still have and how resilient my children have been. I previously had only a vague idea about what they were learning in school, and now I can see every detail of every lesson. Last week, the boys wrote poems, came up with alliterative sentences, sketched animals, and submitted math worksheets and recordings of themselves reading to their teachers."", ""A few days ago, my 7-year-old figured out how to email me at work during his virtual school day. “hi mom don’t forget to send things!” he wrote in a string of emails, to which I replied with emojis and asked him to focus on his lessons. At 3 p.m., the email chain concluded with his last message: “END OF SCHOOL!!!1!1!!!! YAY!!!!”"",

They do it for too little time, or they don’t do it at all."", ""Proper handwashing means scrubbing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."", 
""Yet just 5% of people spent more than 15 seconds washing their hands after using the restroom, and 10% didn’t wash their hands at all, in a study of 3,749 college students published in the Journal of Environmental Health in 2013."", ""How to Wash Your Hands"", ""Hands are villages to thousands of germs—including bacteria and viruses. All it takes is a friendly handshake to spread respiratory diseases like Covid-19, the disease caused by the new virus. Respiratory droplets from coughs and sneezes can also spread these germs, as can touching surfaces like doorknobs and phones where those droplets may have landed."", 
""“I don’t think we need to panic,” says Elaine Larson, professor emerita of nursing research at the Columbia School of Nursing, who has helped the World Health Organization develop handwashing guidelines. “But we do need to be reminded about basic hygiene.”"", ""The virus’s fate is in your hands—literally—so experts say it’s time to start practicing what science is preaching."", ""—Use soap. Before applying soap to your hands, run water over them. Soap and water together, with rubbing, is what helps rinse organisms off your hands and down the drain. Don’t worry about removing hand jewelry, Dr. Larson says. Those need to be washed, too."", 
""Soap acts as a surfactant: a substance that helps release bacteria’s grip from your hand when water is added. The study of college students, however, showed only two in three people used soap. The rest just rinsed their hands."", ""Dr. Larson suggests half a teaspoon of liquid soap is enough, or a glob about the size of a quarter, although bigger hands might need more. Health experts say that too much soap can remove your skin’s natural oils, which have helpful antibacterial properties."", ""The CDC says studies haven’t shown that soaps with antibacterial ingredients provide any health benefits or remove more germs than plain soaps. All soaps, however, can deactivate a coronavirus so it can no longer infect you."", 
""The new coronavirus, coined SARS-CoV-2, is a spherical structure with spiky proteins attached to a membrane, or envelope, that protects the pathogen’s genetic material. Once it comes into contact with soap, this envelope dissolves, leaving behind a dysfunctional virus."", ""“The envelope is a machine that allows the virus to sneak into human cells,” says Jonathan Abraham, an assistant professor of microbiology at Harvard Medical School. “Without it, the virus cannot infect you.”"", ""—Scrub all surfaces of your hands. People on average wash their hands for only about six seconds, according to several studies. Twenty seconds is what’s recommended—or, the length of the “Happy Birthday” song sung twice—though it depends on what you touched and how often."", 
""And even 20 seconds “is not helpful if you’re not washing the right places,” Dr. Larson says. “It’s about quality, not quantity.”"", ""The most vulnerable parts of your hands are your fingertips, between your fingers, the backs of your hands and under your nails. Rubbing these surfaces with enough force is critical, health experts say. People who have longer nails should be extra cautious, they add."", ""Scrubbing too hard or too frequently can damage your skin by making it dry and more susceptible to cracking, Dr. Larson says. Cuts and cracks give germs the perfect spot to set up shop. To avoid skin damage, Dr. Larson recommends using a moisturizer after washing."", 
""Studies have shown that water temperature doesn’t affect how many germs are removed. The CDC says warm or cold water will do, but some experts warn that when water is too hot, it can also damage skin."", ""After a thorough scrub with soap, remove all suds by rubbing every surface of your hands under running, clean water to ensure that pathogens get washed away, Dr. Abraham says. Leaving some soap behind may also soak up moisture from your hands, leaving them dry and more likely to crack."", ""—Dry your hands completely. Now it’s time to dry your hands as thoroughly as you can, because moist hands give living organisms a better chance of surviving and spreading to others, Dr. Abraham says."", 
""The CDC says there is not enough data to confirm whether a significant amount of germs are transferred from the faucet knob to your hands. Some experts suggest using a paper towel to turn the water off, while others discourage it because it wastes paper towels."", ""Automatic blowers and paper towels both dry hands well."", ""—Use alcohol-based sanitizers in a pinch. If you’re on the go, alcohol-based sanitizers are great alternatives to soap and water. They cannot kill all viruses, like the norovirus, which lacks a dissolvable envelope. But a sanitizer can kill any coronavirus on your hands as long as it’s made up of at least 60% alcohol, health experts say. Plain rubbing alcohol also works, but sanitizers maintain a balance of alcohol and other ingredients to help keep skin healthy and moisturized."", 
""It’s important to use enough sanitizer to cover the entire hand. Dr. Larson suggests half to one teaspoon."", ""Sanitizer also works only when it’s still wet, so health experts advise against using paper towels to dab your hands. Give the product at least 10 seconds to complete its job, then rub your hands together or let them air-dry."", ""Get an early-morning coronavirus briefing each weekday, plus a health-news update Fridays: Sign up."", ""Ms. Camero is a reporter for The Wall Street Journal in New York.

""Tony Maloney,\n\n\n\n      the fitness center manager at National Institute for Fitness and Sport in Indianapolis, points out that people should be exercising now more than ever. “When endorphin levels go up, it can counteract the stress response that is so damaging to the immune system,” he says. “Exercise also improves mental health. When you’re feeling down or stressed, exercise can put a smile on your face.”"", ""Madison Mitteness still braves the treadmill at her gym in New York City, but says she won’t touch the dumbbells or weight machines for fear of germs. Her logic, that the more people touch shared objects, the higher their risk of transmitting a virus, isn’t unfounded."", 
""But according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, coronavirus spreads more easily between people standing within about 6 feet than through contact with contaminated surfaces. Cleaning and disinfecting surfaces appears to lower the chances of transmission."", ""Gregory Poland, director of the Vaccine Research Group at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., says the gym isn’t necessarily riskier than any other communal area, but people should remain vigilant. His tactic at the gym has been to use hand sanitizer—at least 60% alcohol-based—liberally every time he touches a piece of equipment. In general, things like gym towels, he says, are less risky, since fewer people touch them."", 
""“If someone with the virus has coughed or sneezed and then touches an inanimate object like a dumbbell or even the pen for a sign-in sheet, there is an increased chance of transmission, but no more than the flu,” he says. In the past four months there have been over 800 cases of novel coronavirus in the U.S. that we know of and, as of Tuesday, 28 deaths."", ""If you live in a city with an outbreak, Dr. Poland suggests skipping the studio and getting your endorphin fix at home through an online class or app. Outdoor exercise is also safe, he says, as long as you keep a distance from people. “A triathlon where you are jammed up with others wouldn’t be smart,” he says."", 
""However, if you live someplace that has not experienced an outbreak, he suggests taking the same precautions you would during flu season. He recommends getting a flu vaccine and working out in areas with a minimum of 3 to 5 feet between pieces of equipment or other people."", ""And don’t just rinse your hands. Wash them for at least 20 seconds. “I have never seen a lay person wash their hands properly,” he says. “You put your fingertips, not your palms, in your eyes, nose or mouth. No one washes their fingertips.”"", 
""Gyms and fitness studios across the country have stepped up hygiene messaging and measures to give members peace of mind."", ""Barry’s Bootcamp advised clients to avoid “kissing, hugging and the sharing of cups and water bottles” at the gym. And Equinox says it is disinfecting all clubs with a hospital-grade solution three times a day. It’s asked instructors to eliminate skin-to-skin contact such as adjustments in yoga."", ""Keith Worts, the CEO of Crunch Signature, says the company hasn’t seen a change in usage over the past three weeks. “The biggest behavioral shift we’ve seen is that more people wipe down their equipment before and after use,” he says."", 
""Nathan Reyna,\n\n\n\n      a member of Elite by NYSC, an upscale offshoot of New York Sports Club, says he feels less paranoid going to the gym because he feels that his gym’s management is taking the coronavirus threat seriously."", ""“Not only have they emailed tips on how to combat the virus, but they have amped up deep cleans,” he says. Mr. Reyna, who says the gym is both his social hub and stress reliever, still takes extra precaution and brings his own disinfectant wipes and thoroughly washes his hands before and after his workouts. “I see a lot more people doing the same,” he says. “Maybe this should be the new norm.”"", 
""Kate Pallardy,\n\n\n\n      an elite runner and New York Sports Club member, says she’s always washed her hands well pre- and post-workout. “For me, this is like the scares we’ve had with Zika, SARS or the flu,” she says. “No virus will ever stop me from working out.”"", ""The continued spread of coronavirus has put hygiene at the top of everyone’s mind.

Instead, they say, stick with the more mundane, but proven, approaches:"", 
""• Keep your stress levels down. It’s a bit of a vicious cycle, of course: The more you stress about the virus, the more likely you are to suffer from it. “Stress can certainly hurt your immune system,” says\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Morgan Katz,\n\n\n\n      an assistant professor of infectious diseases at Johns Hopkins University. “Do not panic, try to minimize stress.”"", ""Andrew Diamond,\n\n\n\n      chief medical officer of One Medical, a nationwide network of primary-care providers, says the stress hormone cortisol turns off cells in your immune system. He recommends engaging in activities that people find relaxing, such as meditation."", 
""• Exercise. Low- and moderate-intensity exercise naturally lowers cortisol levels and helps with immune-system function, says Dr. Diamond. One Medical recommends 30 to 60 minutes of exercise a day. If you’re apprehensive about germs in the gym, walk or run outside."", ""But it is important not to go overboard. A recent study found high-performance athletes have an increased risk of infection, says\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Elizabeth Bradley,\n\n\n\n      medical director of the Cleveland Clinic’s Center for Functional Medicine. “Exercise helps boost the immune system, but we have to be careful not to overexercise because it can weaken your immune system,” she says."", 
""• Get adequate sleep. For adults, that means getting seven to eight hours of sleep a night. Children should get more, depending on their age."", ""• Make sure your vaccines are up-to-date, especially the flu vaccine."", ""• Eat plenty of plain yogurt every day. “It’s really an easy way to boost your probiotics and help support your microbiome,” Dr. Katz says. “It helps to support the good bacteria that live in your body, which help to fight bad bacteria or viruses.”"", ""Dr. Katz also suggests avoiding antibiotics unless you must take them because they deplete the good bacteria in the system, leaving you more vulnerable to other infections."", 
""Other foods that can help support the microbiome include garlic, onion, ginger, sauerkraut and fermented foods, says Dr. Bradley."", ""• Watch your diet. Stick to a healthful, balanced diet filled with lots of colorful fruits and vegetables to ensure you’re getting enough zinc and vitamin D and other important vitamins and minerals. Most experts say you should be able to get enough of these vitamins and minerals through your diet, and extra supplementation isn’t necessary. But because vitamin D deficiency is relatively common, experts do recommend supplementation if levels are low."", 
""Dr. Bradley recommends eating lots of dark green, leafy vegetables and berries, as well as nuts and seeds, and to minimize foods with sugar and trans fats, which aren’t as nutrient-dense."", ""Your immune system needs fuel, so avoid ultralow-carbohydrate diets, experts say. In addition, drink lots of water and reduce alcohol consumption, which can disrupt your sleep."", ""• Stop smoking or vaping. Smokers and those with respiratory disease have a higher rate of serious illness and complications from coronavirus. “Anything that is challenging to your lungs is going to work in the wrong direction,” says Dr. Diamond."",

""After days of disinfecting my phone like a surgical tray, I was shocked. Phone cleaning is certainly not as cut and dried as you thought. After hours of research and scrubbing phones with everything from\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Clorox\n\n\n      wipes to Lysol toilet-bowl cleaner, I’ve come up with some basic lessons for what you can do—and not do—with that petri dish phone of yours."", ""Let’s be very clear: Even when there isn’t a pandemic sweeping the globe, your phone can get dirty."", 
""Generally, that filth is not an issue, says\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Emma Hayhurst,\n\n\n\n      a microbiologist at the University of South Wales and co-author on the aforementioned Journal of Hospital Infection paper. “We were trying to avoid mass panic about mucky phones. When you are healthy, it’s really not a problem.”"", ""Translation: You should clean your phone—just not compulsively."", ""“We don’t need to be obsessively washing our phones right now. If people are coming into contact with coronavirus patients, then, yes. Wash your phone all the time. Not because there is evidence that it will transmit via a phone but because there is no evidence that it won’t,” says Dr. Hayhurst."", 
""It’s long been the guidance of\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Apple,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Samsung\n\n\n      and other phone makers to just use a microfiber cloth to shine up your device."", ""All my new infectious-disease friends, however, say that to effectively kill the virus on a surface, you need disinfectant solution—for instance, something with at least 55% isopropyl alcohol."", ""On Monday, I reported that Apple updated its website to remove its blanket ban on all cleaning supplies. It now gives the OK to use a 70% isopropyl alcohol wipe or Clorox disinfecting wipe on the surface of all Apple products. Google also confirmed that it’s OK to use isopropyl alcohol or Clorox wipes to clean its Pixel devices."", 
""After publication of this column, Samsung updated its cleaning guidance to include alcohol-based cleaners. It now advises Galaxy owners to dampen a cloth with a disinfectant or alcohol-based solution and wipe gently. It says not to apply liquid directly onto your phone."", ""Of course, the big question right now is, where do you BUY the wipes?"", ""Can you use soap and water, as many have asked me? Sure, but avoid using rough paper towels or sponges on the screen. And never use bleach."", ""The big cleaning-solution fear cited by smartphone makers is damage to your phone screen’s oleophobic layer. This is a protective coating on your screen that repels both water and oil. Basically, it helps minimize fingerprints and smudges."", 
""“Cleaning products and abrasive materials will diminish the coating and might scratch your iPhone,” Apple’s website reads."", ""I took it upon myself to test that, as you’ll see in the video above. Using a brand-new iPhone 8, I wiped the screen 1,095 times with Clorox disinfecting wipes. I figured that’s the equivalent of wiping down your phone every day for the three years you might own it. The only thing showing any wear after all that wiping? My poor, wrinkly fingers. The coating still repelled drops of olive oil like it did when I first took it out of the box."", 
""So I upped the effort. I was told that hydrochloric acid, found in toilet-bowl cleaner, would take it right off. Yet after five minutes of scrubbing, it was still fine. Soft Scrub with some bleach for five minutes? Still in decent shape. Finally, I decided to let it sit in a stew of toilet-bowl cleaner for two hours, then I threw in a five-minute rubdown with nail-polish remover, which has acetone. That did it…just about. (The phone, miraculously, still worked.)"", ""Should you do any of that? Absolutely not, but these screens are far more resistant to these products than I’d thought. Plus, the oleophobic layer on your phone is going to wear from normal use anyway."", 
""When cleaning with your disinfecting wipes, however, avoid getting liquid in the ports. Even if most phones are now water resistant, that resistance wears over time."", ""There’s a big difference between cleaning glass or metal and cleaning silicone, plastic or genuine leather. Apple provides good advice on cleaning the various materials its cases are made of. Even if you don’t have an official Apple case, these tips can be helpful."", ""When I was at a hospital last week, I met a nurse who had a phone case especially for work. (She still cleans it every day.)"", 
""If you’re not into getting your phone and hands all wet, you can try a UV sanitizing gadget like the $100 PhoneSoap Go. Pop your phone in the tiny tanning bed for 10 minutes and the company claims to kill 99.9% of bacteria and germs on it."", ""Why use this instead of a wipe? Well, because apparently we suck at cleaning. People don’t cover the whole phone well with disinfecting solutions, according to PhoneSoap chief executive and co-founder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Wesley LaPorte.\n\n\n\n      Plus, if you don’t let the cleaning solution sit for a while—Clorox recommends four minutes on its container—some bacteria might survive."", 
""“This disinfects in a consistent manner,” Mr. LaPorte says."", ""I was too busy killing oleophobic coating to test this independently, but the microbiologists I spoke with said UV light can be an effective way to kill bacteria."", ""PhoneSoap says it has seen 1,000% revenue growth this year, due to increased interest in phone cleaning since the coronavirus spread. Last week, inventory the company put up on Amazon sold out within an hour."", ""Samsung is fine with you using PhoneSoap or its competitors—and is even offering free UV cleaning at select Samsung stores, if you feel like venturing out. Apple doesn’t explicitly offer in-store cleaning, but store employees are known to clean gadgets using wipes with 70% isopropyl alcohol."", 
""Our anxieties are at an all-time high, understandably. If cleaning makes you feel better, grab some wipes and go to town. Wipe for hours—even days. Your phone will be just fine. Just remember, you really don’t need to. Unless you’re one of those crazy phone lickers."", ""—Kenny Wassus contributed to this column."", ""—For more WSJ Technology analysis, reviews, advice and headlines, sign up for our weekly newsletter."", ""Copyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Travel has been halted across the globe. Borders are shut. Hundreds of millions of people are in effective lockdown in the European Union, and the U.S. is heading in that direction. The crisis has erased trillions of dollars from global stock markets and imperiled the future of millions of small businesses around the world, along with the livelihoods of vast numbers of wage earners."", 
""In the months ahead, we are likely to see one of the sharpest economic contractions on record, and the downturn will undoubtedly serve as yet more evidence for those who have argued in recent years that globalization is coming to an end, or at least being rolled back. Nicolas Tenzer, chair of the Cerap think tank in Paris, argues that the rising barriers in response to the virus will strengthen “the populist and nationalist forces that have long called for reinforcing borders. It is a true gift for them.” The veteran U.S. market commentator Gary Shilling recently wrote, “The coronavirus’s depressing effects on the global economy and disruptions of supply chains is…driving the last nail into the coffin of the globalists.” Ian Bremmer, founder of the risk-consultancy Eurasia Group, sees a starker era ahead, including more palpable tension between the U.S. and China. “Globalization has been the biggest driver of economic growth,” he says. “Its trajectory is now shifting, largely for geopolitical reasons, and that will be accelerated by the coronavirus crisis.”"", 
""In the midst of our current spiral, it is hard to resist such dire forecasts. But we should. There is every reason to think that our post-coronavirus future will see not an end to the globalizing trend of recent decades but a new chapter in that story. The sudden halt in commerce and travel precipitated by the outbreak will not snap back overnight, and the next few years will see a re-nationalization of some industries for countries that can. But when this crisis passes, we are likely to find fresh confirmation of what we already know about globalization: that it’s easy to hate, convenient to target and impossible to stop."", 
""Even before the virus, there were indications of both a pause and a modest pullback in globalization. Last year, global trade contracted a smidgen, by less than 1%, but at $19 trillion, it was still higher than any year before the record-setting 2018. As for China and the U.S., the dual effect of the Trump administration’s tariffs and the assertive nationalism of Xi Jinping put a brake on further integration. Data from the U.S. Census Bureau show that the total value of trade in goods between the two countries declined from $630 billion in 2017 to $560 billion in 2019. Even so, this pullback just puts the U.S. and China back at the trade level of 2013. And that amount, it should be noted, is almost five times what it was in 2001. In short, even after two years of trade war and diplomatic acrimony, the key axis of globalization was dented, but only barely."", 
""As the U.S. was erecting tariffs, the Chinese government, for its part, was ramping up spending abroad. Since 2014, China’s Belt and Road Initiative has invested almost $1 trillion in Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, Southeast Asia and elsewhere. According to the consulting firm Gavekal Dragonomics, the rate of new Chinese investment slowed to just over $100 billion last year, but the initiative remains an incontrovertible example of China-driven globalization."", ""WSJ Membership"", ""Customer Service"",

The more they prioritize health and safety, the bigger the near-term cost to the economy, and vice versa."", ""Second, at the outset of the disaster, policy makers are coping with enormous uncertainty. Early responses are often timid or off-target and more sweeping action is delayed by political disagreement."", ""“We learned that we need to prioritize speed, think in tranches, be visible and worry about how to pay for it later,” said Tim Adams who served in the Treasury Department during 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina and is now president of the Institute of International Finance. “If you wait to craft the perfect response, you’ll lose valuable time and you’ll miss something no matter what.”"",

As researchers show more results, government agencies like the FDA will face pressure to quicken the trial and vetting process for new drugs, and funding agencies will need to give researchers more flexibility to follow the discoveries wherever they lead."",

That’s not only plausible but likely based on what we know so far."", ""Population samples from China, Italy, Iceland and the U.S. provide relevant evidence. On or around Jan. 31, countries sent planes to evacuate citizens from Wuhan, China. When those planes landed, the passengers were tested for Covid-19 and quarantined. After 14 days, the percentage who tested positive was 0.9%. If this was the prevalence in the greater Wuhan area on Jan. 31, then, with a population of about 20 million, greater Wuhan had 178,000 infections, about 30-fold more than the number of reported cases.

And how can they stay sane during it all?"", ""We talked to pediatricians, educators and child psychologists to get their advice on everything from daily schedules and screen time to how best to motivate kids to do their online schoolwork. Here’s what they said:"", 
""Yes, your child does need some sort of schedule. No, it doesn’t have to look like the typical school day."", ""Ambitious, color-coded schedules that divide the day into 45-minute blocks filled with productive activities have proliferated on social media. But such a rigorous schedule may just set families up for failure, says Roberta Lenger Kang, director of the Center for the Professional Development of Teachers at Teachers College, Columbia University."", ""Take time to figure out what works for your family. Dr. Lenger Kang, who lives in New York City, has important online meetings in the morning and needs to be quickly responding to emails then. So her three children, ages 4, 6 and 13, spend their mornings going on walks with their father, playing with Legos and having screen time. After lunch, she helps them with their school work. “Think about the learning. That is the important thing, not the timing,” she says."", 
""Still, kids do need a structure, says Rebecca Rialon Berry, clinical associate professor of child and adolescent psychiatry at NYU Langone Health. “Children thrive on routine, which can help them feel safe, regulated and calm,” she says."", ""So, neither kids nor parents should lounge in their PJ’s all day (no matter how tempting that may be). In the morning, children should do their typical getting-ready-for-school routine, such as brushing teeth, making beds and dressing in what they’d usually wear to school, Dr. Rialon Berry says. Keep bedtimes and wake times relatively consistent. Daily physical activity is important, too: Take time for “recess” outside or an indoor dance party. And give children a say in their schedules. You’ll get more buy-in that way, she says."", 
""It can be helpful to define the beginning of the school day in a physical way, such as going for a walk, says Mary Alvord, a psychologist in Chevy Chase, Md. That can provide at least some psychological separation between “home” and “school.”"", ""Be creative—and try virtual help—to motivate kids to do their schoolwork."", ""As any parent who has dealt with evening homework tussles knows, it can sometimes be tough to get kids to complete their assignments. And now there’s a whole lot more schoolwork that parents are on the hook to supervise."", 
""What activities and websites do you recommend for keeping children engaged? Join the conversation below."", ""Opt for “positive reinforcement over negative corrections,” advises Dr. Lenger Kang. For younger kids, under age 8 or so, “giving out high-fives” can be enough. The reward of a snack or screen time after a certain amount of schoolwork can also motivate kids, she says."", ""Dr. Alvord suggests hiring high-school or college students (who likely have a lot more time on their hands now) as virtual tutors for an hour or so a day to supervise schoolwork."", 
""“It is a way to change the dynamic,” she says. Children will think “it is kind of cool” to spend time with an older student and will more likely get their work done without a struggle. It can also ratchet down tension within the family."", ""Parents must agree about who is “on.”"", ""While middle- and high-school students may be relatively self-sufficient during their at-home school day, especially as more school districts get their curricula up and running, most elementary-schoolers and younger children will need a parent to supervise."", 
""Parents must work out who does what and when—but not in front of the children. Divvying up household responsibilities can cause conflict in the best of times. When both parents are working from home, “there can be a lot of conflict around whose job is more important, who has a deadline,” says Paul Donahue, a child psychologist in Scarsdale, N.Y. “As much as possible, we want to iron out those [issues and responsibilities] outside of earshot of the kids,” he says. “Each person has to make sacrifices.”"", 
""Screen-time rules can be relaxed. A lot."", ""Pediatrician Dimitri Christakis is a lead author of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ media guidelines for young children, which recommend that preschoolers (ages 2 to 5) “limit screen use to one hour per day of high-quality programs.” But even he says those recommendations are unrealistic in the current reality when many parents are working from home without child care."", ""“The guidelines were never issued with the apocalypse in mind,” he says. Instead, he recommends parents limit preschoolers’ screen time to four hours a day."", 
""“Of all the age groups, preschool has a fair amount of high-quality educational programming,” says Dr. Christakis, who is also the director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development at Seattle Children’s Research Institute. He suggests that parents use guides like those from Common Sense Media, a nonprofit that recommends age-appropriate entertainment, to choose content and talk to children about what they have seen and learned."", ""For elementary-schoolers, Dr. Christakis suggests limiting recreational screen time (not including what’s necessary for online learning) to three hours a day. “Given parental needs in this situation, we should be willing to be fairly lax about these things,” he says. For middle school and high school, Dr. Christakis says to make sure tweens and teens are spending at least four hours a day away from screens (not including sleep time). There should be no screen time during meals, and for at least one hour before bedtime."", 
""Kids still need a social life."", ""Between social media and multiplayer gaming, older children and teens tend to have a lot of experience connecting with their friends digitally. But younger children need to spend time with their friends in this new world, too."", ""“Young people really rely on social connections. Not having it, over time, can have an effect on mood and self-esteem,” says Dr. Rialon Berry."", ""Parents can arrange virtual playdates using Google Hangouts or Zoom. Dr. Lenger Kang is helping her 13-year-old son set up an online Dungeons & Dragons club with his friends."", 
""Dr. Donahue, the child psychologist, says responsible teens also could take walks together—as long as they stay 6 feet apart, as public-health officials recommend."", ""Some time alone is good, too."", ""Kids, especially teens, still need some physical and psychological space. With families suddenly spending so much time together, a spike in squabbles is probably inevitable, especially among siblings."", ""It is important for each child to spend some time alone to decompress, says Dr. Rialon Berry. For siblings who share a room, she suggests that each child gets at least 30 minutes a day in their room alone to do what they want."", 
""Many teenagers are used to a certain amount of physical freedom. They may have had cars, jobs and liberal curfews. Now, they might be chafing at new rules and saddened by their loss of freedom."", ""“We have to recognize that they, too, are experiencing stress and strain,” says Nathaniel Beers, a pediatrician at Children’s National Hospital in Washington, D.C. Parents should give them privacy to connect with their friends and “vent to their community,” he says."", ""Brad Sachs, a family psychologist in Columbia, Md., says parents can help teens who are “rattling the cage for more independence” by encouraging their social consciousness and sense of altruism. Suggest that they offer to pick up groceries for a senior, or that they communicate with an isolated family member through FaceTime."", 
""Says Dr. Sachs, “Those concrete actions tend to take the edge off that loss of autonomy.”"", ""Ms. Petersen is a reporter for The Wall Street Journal in New York.

That ended this month with the attack of the coronavirus and Thursday’s record spike of three million new jobless claims. Millions more will follow in the coming weeks, and the goal of public policy should be to get them back to work as soon as possible—not to keep them on the government’s unemployment tab."", ""That point may seem obvious but you wouldn’t know it from this week’s flap over the enhanced jobless benefits in the Senate’s $2 trillion coronavirus relief bill. The bill increases unemployment benefits for all workers by $600 per week for the next four months. Even the liberal Economic Policy Institute says this expansion would provide a “100% replacement of wage income for the bottom half of the workforce.” Some will earn more by not working."", 
""Republican Senators\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Ben Sasse,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Lindsey Graham,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Tim Scott\n\n\n\n      and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Rick Scott\n\n\n\n      warned that this might hurt small employers in their states by encouraging workers to stay at home for longer. Speaker\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Nancy Pelosi\n      \n\n\n\n      called them “cruel”—the word is her version of\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Donald Trump’s\n      \n\n\n\n      “incredible”—and the media echoed her."", 
""The Senators are right if you know anything about labor markets and incentives to work. Jobless benefits are administered by the states, each of which sets its own eligibility requirements and payment levels. Benefits are typically based on a worker’s prior earnings and limited to between 50% and 70% of a state’s average weekly wage. The maximum benefit runs up to $823 in Massachusetts while the minimum is as low as $10 in Louisiana for low-earners."", ""The current economic crisis is like no other because government has literally forced hundreds of thousands of businesses to shut down. And because so many workers are likely to lose their jobs, more generous benefits will cushion the short-term blow. But the goal should be returning people to private payrolls when the crisis passes, and the risk is that benefits at 100% of wages for the long term will do the opposite and slow the recovery."", 
""The blunt Democratic solution, which Republicans too easily agreed to as a price of the bill, is to give all laid-off workers a $600 benefit increase on top of their normal unemployment compensation for up to four months. So workers will now make at least $15 an hour (assuming a 40-hour workweek) and as much as $35 an hour in places like Massachusetts—for not working."", ""Amazon,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Walmart,\n\n\n      CVS and delivery services are seeking to hire hundreds of thousands of workers to meet a surge in demand even as the virus spreads. Many are boosting pay, but how are they supposed to compete with workers who can stay at home and make more?"", 
""The experience after the 2008-2009 recession is instructive. Congress repeatedly extended unemployment benefits, which expire after 26 weeks in most states, to up to 99 weeks until December 2013. The national jobless rate stayed high far longer than in a typical recovery and the incentive not to work is one reason."", ""The economic evidence on this incentive point isn’t controversial or partisan. In March 2010 economists at the liberal Brookings Institution reported that jobless insurance extensions “correspond to between 0.7 and 1.8 percentage points of the 5.5 percentage point increase in the unemployment rate witnessed in the current recession.”"", 
""The enhanced benefits expire after four months, but we’ll bet Speaker Pelosi’s pension that Democrats will be back demanding an extension through the end of the year and calling Republicans “cruel” if they disagree. America needs an economic recovery from the virus recession that is faster and stronger than the last expansion. That means helping laid-off workers for the short term rather than providing a reason not to return to work."", ""Copyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Many school closures are likely to last through the end of this school year, and more may be needed in the fall if the virus’s spread picks up then. These shutdowns have created a range of dire short-term problems, including inconsistent access to home internet and the disruption of essential meal programs and child care for working parents. In the long term, they may bring about profound changes in how we school our children."", 
""In the coming year, students and teachers may need to break down barriers between in-person and at-home schooling, and be ready to shift from one to the other with little notice. It may be a deeply challenging period for families and educators. A constant uncertainty about when school will be in session could force a re-evaluation of the traditional methods we use to pace students and track progress. “Seat time,” a term to measure the duration of classroom instruction, won’t seem sufficient when seats may be in different places and times. The idea of individual pacing and mastery of subjects may become mainstream, because they’ll be a necessity."", 
""Teachers have always known that kids learn at different speeds and that debilitating gaps can form when students are pushed forward at one fixed pace. But historically, it has been a struggle to personalize learning for each student. Over the past decade, online tools have started to be leveraged in classrooms to address this need. They’ve allowed students to work on what they are ready for and to have as many chances as needed to master concepts. Decades of research on such “mastery learning” shows that it works. If it becomes mainstream inside and outside classrooms because of school closures, it has a chance to accelerate student learning."",

The question is, what works? How do we get our basic social needs met during a pandemic?"",

Stored away and forgotten until January this year, the sample from the horseshoe bat contains the virus that causes Covid-19."", ""The scientists were mostly sampling a very similar species with slightly shorter wings, called Rhinolophus sinicus, in a successful search for the origin of the virus responsible for the SARS epidemic of 2002-03. That search had alarming implications, which were largely ignored."",

Back in the laboratory, they found that one of the viruses from bat droppings, called WIV1, could thrive in monkey and human cells specially engineered to activate the gene for ACE2 receptors, the lock to which a coronavirus’s spike protein can fit as a key. This suggested that people could catch SARS directly from a bat dropping."", 
""Then in 2016, Ralph Baric and colleagues at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill showed that the same bat virus could infect live mice that had been engineered to express the human gene for the ACE2 receptor.

But there’s already one way to ensure future pandemics are less deadly: Reform or defund the World Health Organization (WHO)."", ""Last week Florida Senator\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Rick Scott\n\n\n\n      called for a Congressional investigation into the United Nations agency’s “role in helping Communist China cover up information regarding the threat of the Coronavirus.” The rot at WHO goes beyond canoodling with Beijing, but that’s a good place to start."", 
""The coronavirus outbreak began in Wuhan, China, sometime in the autumn, perhaps as early as November. It accelerated in December. Caixin Global reported that Chinese labs had sequenced the coronavirus genome by the end of December but were ordered by Chinese officials to destroy samples and not publish their findings. On Dec. 30\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Dr. Li Wenliang\n\n\n\n      warned Chinese doctors about the virus, and several days later local authorities accused him of lies that “severely disturbed the social order.”"", 
""Taiwanese officials warned WHO on Dec. 31 that they had seen evidence that the virus could be transmitted human-to-human. But the agency, bowing to Beijing, doesn’t have a normal relationship with Taiwan. On Jan. 14 WHO tweeted, “Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission.” The agency took another week to reverse that misinformation."", ""On Jan. 22-23 a WHO emergency committee debated whether to declare Covid-19 a “public health emergency of international concern.” The virus already had spread to several countries, and making such a declaration would have better prepared the world. It should have been an easy decision, despite Beijing’s objections. Yet director-general\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Tedros Ghebreyesus\n\n\n\n      declined and instead traveled to China."", 
""He finally made the declaration on Jan. 30—losing a week of precious time—and his rhetoric suggests the trip to Beijing was more about politics than public health. “The Chinese government is to be congratulated for the extraordinary measures it has taken,” he said. “I left in absolutely no doubt about China’s commitment to transparency.”"", ""A University of Southampton study suggests the number of coronavirus cases could have been reduced by 95% had China moved to contain the virus three weeks sooner. Yet Dr. Tedros gushed that Beijing had set “a new standard for outbreak response.” He also praised the speed with which China “sequenced the genome and shared it with WHO and the world.” China didn’t do so until Jan. 12."", 
""On Jan. 30 Dr. Tedros also said that “WHO doesn’t recommend limiting trade and movement.” President\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Trump\n\n\n\n      ignored the advice and announced travel restrictions on China the following day, slowing the spread of the virus. U.S. progressive elites echoed WHO and criticized Mr. Trump. WHO didn’t declare the coronavirus a pandemic until March 11."", ""Not that any of this has prompted much soul-searching. Alluding to China, WHO official\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Michael Ryan\n\n\n\n      said last week, “We need to be very careful also to not to be profiling certain parts of the world as being uncooperative.” Beijing touted the remarks, as it has other WHO statements."", 
""This record is tragic but not surprising. Much of the blame for WHO’s failures lies with Dr. Tedros, who is a politician, not a medical doctor. As a member of the left-wing Tigray People’s Liberation Front, he rose through Ethiopia’s autocratic government as health and foreign minister. After taking the director-general job in 2017, he tried to install Zimbabwe dictator\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Robert Mugabe\n\n\n\n      as a WHO goodwill ambassador."", ""China inevitably gains more international clout as its economy grows. But why does WHO seem so much more afraid of Beijing’s ire than Washington’s? Only 12% of WHO’s assessed member-state contributions come from China. The U.S. contributes 22%. Americans at WHO generally are loyal to the institution, while Chinese appointees put Chinese interests first or they will suffer Beijing’s wrath."", 
""China’s influence over WHO has been organized and consistent, whereas the U.S. response has been haphazard. Washington needs a quarterback to lead the fight against Chinese dominance at WHO and other international organizations. Yet the State Department’s Bureau of International Organization Affairs lacks a political appointee."", ""The U.S. will have allies in an effort to reform WHO. A frustrated Japanese deputy prime minister called WHO the “Chinese Health Organization.” British Prime Minister\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Boris Johnson\n      \n\n\n\n      reportedly is rethinking U.K.-China ties over China’s lack of candor about the virus."", 
""Congress should investigate how WHO performed against the coronavirus and whether its judgments were corrupted by China’s political influence. Of all international institutions, WHO should be the least political. Its core mission is to coordinate international efforts against epidemics and provide honest public-health guidance."", ""If WHO is merely a politicized Maginot Line against pandemics, then it is worse than useless and should receive no more U.S. funding. And if foreign-policy elites want to know why so many Americans mistrust international institutions, WHO is it."",

Investors have been encouraged in recent days by signs that several states will move to resume business, along with hopes that a viable treatment for Covid-19 could be near."", 
""The blue-chip index rose 2.2% this week, extending its rally over the past two weeks to 15%—its best performance since 1938. The S&P 500 climbed 3% this week, while the Nasdaq Composite surged 6.1% as investors piled into highflying technology stocks. The Dow and S&P 500 are still down more than 10% for the year, while the Nasdaq’s losses have been cut to 3.6%"", ""Many investors agree the most important driver of the rebound has been the Federal Reserve’s massive stimulus plan, combined with the efforts of the U.S. government, which sent a signal that both were willing to step in like never before to buoy the economy. U.S. stocks bottomed March 23, after the Fed cut rates to near-zero."", 
""“They took away the depression. That scenario is out of the picture now,” said Zhiwei Ren, a portfolio manager at Penn Mutual Asset Management. “The Fed is the fundamental reason” for the rebound."", ""The central bank also unleashed a massive program to buy Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities, while President Trump signed a roughly $2 trillion stimulus package, the biggest relief package in U.S. history."", ""For some investors, it doesn’t pay to bet against stocks after the Fed stepped in. The stimulus spurred a fear of missing out among investors and gave many the confidence to resurrect some of the most popular tactics of recent years—buying dips in the stock market and piling into shares of big technology companies."", 
""The coronavirus’ toll on the population and the economy has been dour. More than 150,000 people around the globe have died, while cases world-wide have topped 2 million. In the U.S., more than 22 million Americans have sought unemployment benefits in recent weeks."", ""Retail sales, a measure of purchases at stores, gasoline stations, restaurants, bars and online, fell by a seasonally adjusted 8.7% in March from a month earlier, the most severe decline since record-keeping began in 1992. Earnings for the first quarter among big U.S. companies are expected to decline nearly 15% from a year earlier, according to FactSet, which would mark the biggest decline since 2009."", 
""Still, as the data has darkened, investors have been buying stocks, extending the Dow’s rally from its March low to 30%. It is a sharp about-face from March, the most volatile month in the stock market’s history, when the 11-year bull market in equities abruptly ended."", ""“While it’s great to be in the green, we do wonder, what is it that the markets are celebrating,” said Amy Kong, chief investment officer at Barrett Asset Management. “Nobody knows how long this is going to last,” she said of the pandemic."",

""Marko Kolanovic,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            JPMorgan Chase\n\n\n      & Co’s global head of quantitative and derivatives strategy, has been analyzing reams of data on the spread of the pandemic around the globe, looking at hospitalization rates and resources like hospital beds for clients. He expects U.S. stocks to be back at highs in the first half of next year. Why? Going against the Federal Reserve is typically a losing battle, he said."", ""The Fed’s latest move “reinforces our view of a full asset price recovery, and equity markets reaching all-time highs next year,” Mr. Kolanovic said in a recent note. “Investors with [a] focus on negative upcoming earnings and economic developments are effectively ‘fighting the Fed,’ which was historically a losing proposition.”"", 
""There may be limits to that approach, other analysts said. For example, a $350 billion small-business loan program from the U.S. government has already exhausted its funding, highlighting the mammoth challenge that lawmakers face—and sheer amount of cash necessary—to support the economy and keep Americans employed."", ""These types of loans can be forgiven if firms don’t lay off workers, but U.S. lawmakers have recently struggled to agree on the next round of coronavirus emergency aid."", ""Despite the stimulus checks going to Americans around the country, measures by the central bank and government can’t alter human behavior and force people to leave their homes, eat at restaurants, shop at malls and go to movies. That has led some analysts to say a recovery may take longer than many are currently anticipating."", 
""“How long before you and I are going to feel comfortable going to a concert again?” said Dominic Nolan, a senior managing director at Pacific Asset Management, which oversees roughly $12 billion in debt. “A government program doesn’t really help that.”"", ""Mr. Nolan said that he has recently bought bonds of investment-grade companies after the Federal Reserve’s recent moves."", ""Some investors are still anxious because the bond market is sending a more cautious signal. Investors have continued scooping up traditionally safe assets like government bonds and gold as stocks have rallied. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note has fallen to 0.655% from 1.26% in mid-March as bond prices have risen, while gold prices hit their highest level in more than seven years this week. The concurrent gains across traditionally risky and safe assets alike suggest that many remain concerned about an extended downturn."", 
""Investors have also treated some corners of the stock market as a hiding place, piling into the technology darlings that powered markets higher in recent years."", ""“The Nasdaq is trading like a safe haven in a way,” Mr. Ren of Penn Mutual Asset Management said."", ""Amazon.com Inc.\n\n\n      and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Netflix Inc.\n\n\n      both surged at least 14% this week and set records, while some of the momentum-driven trades that were popular earlier in the year also re-emerged.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Tesla Inc.\n\n\n      has risen for 10 consecutive trading days, its longest winning streak on record, bringing its gain for the year to 80%."",

One-time empires shattered into new states, and temporary border closures became permanent, as did supposedly transient wartime restrictions on individual liberties. The 1920s brought a protectionist and nationalist wave, economic distress and, eventually, the collapse of democratic societies, from Italy to Germany, and the disappearance of Zweig’s Austria. By 1942, when he was finishing his memoir, World War II was raging, and he was a stateless refugee in faraway Brazil. Zweig mailed the manuscript to his publisher and then committed suicide."", 
""When that war ended three years later, however, the borderless, globalized world so eloquently mourned by Zweig began to bounce back, at least in the West.

Ever more people began to enjoy the freedoms that Zweig had once known."", ""That world, our world, had seemed until recently an irreversible certainty.

Socioeconomic factors such as gaps in access to health care no doubt play a role. But another possible factor has been largely overlooked: vitamin D deficiency that weakens the immune system."", ""Researchers last month released the first data supporting this link. Based on a link between levels of the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein and severe cases of Covid-19, they estimate that tens of thousands of lives could be saved world-wide by normalizing vitamin D levels, through its modulation of the inflammatory cascade."", 
""Vitamin D is produced by a reaction in the skin to the ultraviolet rays in sunlight.

As an Indian-American, my skin type is Fitzpatrick IV, or “moderate brown.” Compared with my white friends, I need double or triple the sun exposure to synthesize the same amount of vitamin D, so I supplement with 5,000 international units of vitamin D3 daily, which maintains my level in the normal range. Most African-Americans are Fitzpatrick type V or VI, so they would need even more."", 
""This requires further study, but earlier research is suggestive. In 2018 a longitudinal study by researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital looked at whether vitamin D supplementation had any health benefits, specifically in regard to heart disease and cancer. The overall conclusion was that it didn’t, for most people. Yet buried in the results was one that should have made headlines: Vitamin D supplementation in African-Americans reduced cancer risk 23%.

Dr. Frenk said he estimates that Mexico’s health system is only a few weeks away from being overwhelmed."", 
""Mr. López-Gatell, 51, said he estimates the virus will eventually infect roughly two-thirds of Mexicans, the level at which enough people have developed immunity that further spread becomes more difficult. Left unchecked, the virus would run its course in as little as six weeks, overwhelming the health system, he said. But with social distancing measures, it could take as long as a year or more, similar to the H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009, which first emerged in Mexico and which Mr. López-Gatell also experienced as a health official."",

The committee probe started in January 2017 under then-Chair Devin Nunes and concluded in March 2018 with a report finding no evidence that the Trump campaign conspired with the Kremlin. Most of the transcripts were ready for release long ago, but Mr. Schiff oddly refused to release them after he became chairman in 2019. He only released them last week when the White House threatened to do it first."",

In March 2017 on MSNBC, Mr. Schiff teased that he couldn’t “go into particulars, but there is more than circumstantial evidence now.”"", ""In December 2017 he told CNN that collusion was a fact: “The Russians offered help, the campaign accepted help.

Smaller satellite offices could also pop up in less-expensive locations as the workforce becomes less centralized."",

It’s an important benchmark for other governments as they allow their own economies to emerge from viral hibernation."", ""Scientists at the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), the German government’s epidemiological advisory service, calculate that the coronavirus resumed its spread through the population as the country’s lockdown started easing in late April. The reproduction rate, or R0, was above 1 for several days this week, and as high as 1.1 last weekend.

We have become used to the spectacle of President Trump standing before reporters surrounded by a gaggle of doctors and scientific advisers—sometimes deferring to them, sometimes questioning them, sometimes berating them. Many governors have held similar briefings with their own panels of experts. This week, a Senate committee called in three of the government’s top public-health officials for testimony, and a House committee is looking to hold its own expert briefing later this month. The pronouncements of these specialists frequently drive key decisions and shape public views."", 
""But the costs and burdens of the pandemic response have driven some Americans to criticize the power of the public health professionals who designed it. Skepticism of experts and resentment of their claims to authority have grown. There have been calls to fire Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who has been a prominent counselor to the president. And Dr. Deborah Birx, who leads the White House pandemic task force, has become, in the words of one New York Times report, “a partisan Rorschach test.”"", 
""The debate falls too easily into a familiar pattern. The struggle between technocratic champions of expert rule and populist defenders of the common man is an old story in the U.S. Is rational decision-making a matter of applying the concentrated expertise of a small group of specialists or of aggregating the dispersed preferences of vast swaths of society? Is a more efficient health-care system to be had by empowering just the right MIT professor to back his theories with government mandates, or by empowering market mechanisms to channel the choices of millions of consumers from the bottom up? A great deal of our domestic politics consists of disputes along these lines in different areas."", 
""But the present crisis can help us to see the inadequacy of these debates as a way to think about political leadership. When technical experts advise government officials, they aren’t just conveying neutral facts, but neither are they just playing politics. They offer informed judgment. That’s what makes them useful—and also what limits their value."", ""The idea that scientific expertise can play a purely technical role in the political arena—that the facts speak for themselves if only we would listen—has held particular appeal for American progressives. President John F. Kennedy famously gave voice to this view in 1962, reflecting that ideological categories were growing increasingly useless because “the fact of the matter is that most of the problems, or at least many of them that we now face, are technical problems, are administrative problems…they deal with questions which are beyond the comprehension of most men.”"",

""Now Covid-19 threatens Gilgal’s future. The nonprofit has been forced to cancel two of its three fundraising events: a spring luncheon and a 15-year anniversary celebration in May. Its Blue Jean gala in October is up in the air. Together the three events would have funded between a third and half the charity’s $600,000 annual operating budget; some of its donors are hurting, too."", ""If the crisis continues, Gilgal will have to cut back on half of its programs: the tutoring, coaching and mentoring women into the workforce with life skills they need to succeed like budgeting and managing a household. Gilgal would have to cut staff, too. It would no longer be able to manage the army of volunteer groups that are a large part of its business model. “If we continue in this Covid crisis, then what’s really happening is I’m crippled,” says Val Cater, the charity’s founder and executive director."", 
""Across the country, nonprofits of all types and sizes are in trouble. They have canceled major fundraisers. They have lost huge amounts of ticket and event revenue. Those with government contracts dread what will happen when their fiscal year ends June 30. Demand for services, especially at food banks, is outpacing revenue."", ""Most charities operate on razor-thin margins even in good times. Nonprofits are subject to tight restrictions in most government contracts. Charities are penalized if they don’t keep costs down by the benchmarking firms that donors consult to decide if charities are run well."", 
""In a survey of 3,400 nonprofits two years ago, half said they had only three months’ cash on hand or less; 19% said they had a month or less, according to the Nonprofit Finance Fund, a New York-based lender that conducted the survey. “The system sets them up to be fragile,” says\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Antony Bugg-Levine,\n\n\n\n      CEO of the Nonprofit Finance Fund. The virus-related revenue disruption “is an unprecedented calamity” for nonprofits, he says. He predicts many will collapse."", 
""Nonprofits hurt by the pandemic include venerable ones like the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, which include the de Young museum and the Legion of Honor. The organization is governed by three nonprofit boards and one of them is a department of the city and county. “This is critical” read the subject line of a late-April email to the organization’s members. It faces a projected loss of $9 million in revenue on lost admissions, canceled events and two major fundraisers. It has an annual operating budget of $62 million."", 
""Most, though, are smaller nonprofits like Gilgal. Ninety-two percent of the nation’s 901,206 nonprofits that filed annual returns with the IRS for 2016 had annual budgets of less than $1 million, according to a 2019 report by the National Council of Nonprofits. Most are community-based and focused on a local need."", ""How are you offering support to those in need during this crisis?

I know we need to do more,” says Ms. Fischer. But it had to cancel its April fundraiser; recently it has been close to not making its payroll, she says.

""In Los Angeles, children are in lockdown and can’t get to the Helpline Youth Counseling Center. The agency’s government funding—which makes up about 85% of its operating budget, which was about $6.7 million last year—depends on the amount of counseling it delivers. Director\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Jeff Farber\n\n\n\n      worries his funding will be cut even though the community’s problems have multiplied. “We know that abuse hasn’t stopped,” he says. “The dealers are still out there.”"", 
""As the virus has sapped revenue for nonprofits, it has also been a double whammy in driving up their costs—for masks, cleaning supplies, technology and food—which further restricts how many people they can reach."", ""The challenges faced at Gilgal are similar to those many of the country’s smaller nonprofits are now dealing with."", ""A $60,000 loan from the federal Paycheck Protection Program ensures that for three months Gilgal won’t have to cut staff. But it is meant to protect jobs, not sustain an organization, says Ms. Cater. She has applied to several funding sources, but is realistic about the odds. “I know foundations are being flooded by organizations like Gilgal, so it really is a wait and see situation right now,” she says. “Hope and pray and wait and see.”"", 
""Much of the nonprofit’s food was donated by Hollywood film crews until the virus made it impossible to shoot films in Atlanta."", ""Gilgal usually has 25 women at a time rotating through various parts of the program.

Right now they need help,” she says."", 
""The agency is doing its best to keep the program on track. Ms. Moore holds individual case-management meetings by phone. She teaches relapse prevention and anger management classes on speaker phone."", ""But the virus has put a halt to much of what makes Gilgal hands on. During normal times, the women get a parade of visiting experts and volunteers—students at the Georgia State University School of Nursing who teach about health, Morehouse College business students who coach career planning, resumes and a 30-second elevator pitch, church groups and sorority groups. Volunteers come to explain budgeting, saving and benefits. “What is a 401(k) because whatever it is, I got one today,” Ms. Cater recalls a resident saying after her first day at a hospital job."", 
""In normal times, the women are shepherded into jobs and often housing with the help of a web of relationships forged by Ms. Cater with agencies like the United Way and companies like the\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            United Parcel Service\n\n\n      and CKS Packaging, both based in Atlanta. CKS Packaging’s vice president\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Drew Sewell\n\n\n\n      says the Gilgal women come well-prepared; many have become lifelong employees."", ""At Ms. Powers’s global staffing company, she was just promoted. She never dreamed she’d have savings and be able to give her 11-year-old an allowance. “I just have this joy in my heart I never had before,” she says."", 
""Ms. Cater hopes she can keep Gilgal going. If she can’t make up for the lost revenue, then “everything is on the table,” she says. “We’re just a small nonprofit. We’re a debt-free organization. Even with that, it is a difficult landscape to look into and not have a handle on what the future holds.”"", ""Here are some ways to find charities in need, and a few that are serving those particularly hit hard by the pandemic."", ""Local foundations"", ""The Community Foundation has information on local nonprofits, needs and projects.

Vaccines are likely far off, new therapies and treatments might help a lot, but keeping things closed up tight until there are enough tests isn’t a viable plan. There will never be enough tests, it was botched from the beginning, if we ever catch up it will probably be at the point tests are no longer urgently needed."", 
""Meantime, we must ease up and manage. We should go forward with a new national commitment to masks, social distancing, hand washing. These simple things have proved the most valuable tools in the tool chest. We have to enter each day armored up. At the same time we can’t allow alertness to become exhaustion. We can’t let an appropriate sense of caution turn into an anxiety formation. We can’t become a nation of agoraphobics. We’ll just have to live, carefully."", ""Here’s something we should stop.

They are not now paying an equal degree of sympathetic attention to those living the economic story, such as the Dallas woman who pushed back, opened her hair salon, and was thrown in jail by a preening judge.

The overclass are highly educated and exert outsize influence as managers and leaders of important institutions—hospitals, companies, statehouses. The normal people aren’t connected through professional or social lines to power structures, and they have regular jobs—service worker, small-business owner."",

The only precedent for its rapid spread to every continent, killing people everywhere and devastating both local economies and world trade, was the flu pandemic of 1918-19."", ""In both cases, the germs behind the pandemic weren’t especially lethal. Covid-19 and the flu both fall within the normal range of mild infectious diseases. Compared with smallpox and Ebola, they kill only a small percentage of their victims, and their person-to-person transmissibility isn’t unusual. What sets them apart—what has made them world-wide pandemics—is modern transportation: fast steamships for the flu, and now jet airplanes for Covid-19."", 
""Of course, there have been a great many “mere” epidemics in human history, diseases that have spread more slowly over large areas, but their effects have been profound. Over the course of recorded history and now in the archaeological record, examples abound of germs producing high death tolls and social and political upheaval, with far-reaching effects on local economies, trade, migration, colonization and conquest."", ""Will Covid-19 transform our own era, too? Are we entering an age of pandemics? It is far too early to say, but the long history of germs as agents of historical change can provide needed perspective—and perhaps a window into how Covid-19 and its likely successors may shape our destiny, for good and ill."", 
""Consider first a familiar case: the plague bacterium, which was transmitted from rodents to humans by fleas, and spread from Asia into Europe in the 14th century. The Black Death killed about a third of Europe’s population in the years 1347-51 and recurred with lower death tolls for many decades thereafter."", ""“\n        The Black Death forced landowners to start paying their tenants and to grant them more rights.\n        ”"", ""Its immediate effect on Western Europe’s economy and trade was disastrous. Paradoxically, though, its long-term effect was positive. By reducing the number of laborers, the Black Death forced landowners to start paying their tenants and to grant them more rights and freedoms. Societies became less rigidly stratified; nuclear families became stronger; and sanitation and quarantines developed to combat infectious diseases."", 
""Europeans weren’t the plague’s only victims. In Central Asia, it had a big effect on history’s largest land empire, the Mongol Empire, which stretched from China to Persia and Russia. By cutting off travel and trade, plague severed connections between the empire’s parts, thereby causing Mongol control of Persia and China to collapse in 1335 and 1368, respectively, and control of Russia to wither away slowly."", ""Tropical diseases have had similarly profound effects. Only after quinine was found to be effective in treating malaria, for instance, could Europeans embark on their colonial conquests in New Guinea and Africa, carving up territories where European settlement had been impossible before."", 
""Why, before quinine, were Europeans unable to establish themselves in New Guinea and Africa, where indigenous peoples had been thriving for hundreds of thousands of years? Because different peoples have different susceptibilities to the same disease—a major theme of medical history. Over thousands of years of exposure to malaria, New Guineans and Africans evolved many forms of genetic resistance through natural selection. Northern Europeans, by contrast, had no history of exposure to malaria, hadn’t evolved any of those genetic protections and hence were unlikely to survive long enough to develop antibodies."", 
""The most lethal, permanent and far-reaching effect of germs in recorded history was to aid the European conquest and extensive replacement of Native Americans, Pacific Islanders and Aboriginal Australians. This was the reverse of what happened in Africa and New Guinea, where local diseases and differential susceptibilities enabled local peoples, for a time, to resist European invaders."", ""Perhaps the deadliest germ that Europeans brought with them was smallpox. The disease killed Europeans too, of course, but through natural selection over thousands of years of exposure, they had evolved partial genetic resistance. They also had acquired immunity by developing antibodies. In the centuries before vaccination was developed, smallpox was widespread in Europe, and almost everyone was exposed in childhood, when some died but most survived and remained immune thereafter."", 
""When smallpox was brought by Europeans to the New World, all Native Americans of all ages lacked antibodies, and the mortality rate was high, especially among adults. In 1837, for example, when a steamship on the Missouri River accidentally introduced smallpox to a village of 2,000 previously unexposed Mandan Indians, all but 40 of the villagers died within a few weeks."", ""We often think of European settlers taking up arms to dispossess or kill Native Americans. In fact, most Native Americans died in bed of European diseases, leaving only a fraction to be defeated by guns on the battlefield. The most consequential of these outbreaks were the smallpox epidemics that struck the New World’s most powerful states, the empires of the Aztecs and Incas. The disease killed their emperors Cuitláhuac and Huayna Capac and millions of their subjects, making possible the conquests of Cortés and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Pizarro."", 
""But this familiar history raises a question: Why didn’t Native Americans, like Africans, have diseases of their own to which they had some genetic and acquired resistance—and which could have killed off invading Europeans?"", ""“\n        Covid-19, AIDS, SARS, MERS, Ebola and Marburg are all diseases of animals. \n        ”"", ""The answer is relevant to understanding Covid-19 and other new diseases that have emerged over the past 40 years—AIDS, SARS, MERS, Ebola and Marburg. All of them are zoonoses, that is, diseases of animals. They reach humans from wild animals with which we came into close contact through hunting and animal markets."", 
""We now know that, thousands of years ago, animals were also the source of our major epidemic infectious diseases: smallpox, measles, influenza, tuberculosis and others. The diseases infected us from domestic animals such as cattle, pigs and camels, with which we come into much closer, more frequent and more prolonged contact than with wild animals. It all began around 10,000 years ago, when people began to domesticate livestock."", ""Almost all of our livestock were domesticated in Eurasia, from Eurasian wild ancestors. The only large animal domesticated in the New World was the llama, which didn’t infect us because we don’t milk or cuddle llamas as we do cows and calves, or sheep and lambs. That is why the major epidemic diseases of history have all been Eurasian diseases. Compared with Eurasia, the Americas were a healthy environment, and Native Americans a healthy people, until Europeans arrived, bringing their livestock-derived diseases That is also why Native Americans lacked their own equivalent of smallpox to give back to Europeans."", 
""As scientists have recently discovered, similar deadly encounters also happened long before written history could record them. Archaeologists have found abundant evidence of nomadic horse-mounted herders from the Asian steppes reaching Eastern Europe in prehistoric times. Those herders were the predecessors of the Huns, the Mongols and other steppe invaders who terrorized Europe over the past two millennia."", ""In recent years, geneticists analyzing ancient skeletons have found the DNA of steppe peoples appearing widely over Europe and partly replacing the DNA of Europe’s ancient farmers. But how could these horse-mounted nomads have successfully invaded Europe‘s forests, where their horses would have been of limited military value? Those same forests deprived the Huns and Mongols of their military advantage, so how could their ancient predecessors have succeeded where Attila and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Genghis Khan\n\n\n\n      failed?"", 
""Prehistoric European skeletons have revealed an agent of conquest more potent than horses: DNA of the bacterium causing plague. So perhaps steppe invaders didn’t kill ancient European farmers just with bows and arrows. A troop of plague-bearing nomads riding into a European farming community would have had an effect like that of a Missouri River steamship with a smallpox patient arriving at a Mandan Indian village in 1837."", ""This discovery may also contribute to answering the biggest unresolved question of historical linguistics: the wide distribution today of Indo-European languages, all closely related to each other, from India all the way west to Ireland, from Hindi and Russian to English and Spanish. Linguists and archaeologists studying the differences among these languages suggest that the Indo-European family expanded only within the last 10,000 years."", 
""Biologically modern Homo sapiens has occupied all of Europe for at least the last 30,000 years, however, since the extinction of the Neanderthals. Surely, the modern humans who created the great cave paintings at Lascaux in France spoke fully modern human languages and didn’t just grunt. Yet the only non-Indo-European language remaining in Western Europe today is the Basque language of the Pyrenees."", """", ""One has to wonder whether languages related to Basque were the languages of Europe’s first farmers, most of whose languages were replaced by the Indo-European languages spoken by plague-infected steppe nomads around 5,000 years ago. If so, plague may help to explain why this article is published today in English, rather than in a language related to Basque."", 
""Were germs also involved in some of the other great replacements of the prehistoric past? At least two prominent cases cry out for study."", ""First, as we know from their appearance, genes, languages and archaeological remains, the farming peoples now living in tropical Southeast Asia—Vietnamese, Thais, Malays, Indonesians, Filipinos and others—came originally from South China and Taiwan. But ancient skeletons show that, until around 3,000 B.C., the region was occupied by hunter-gatherers related to modern New Guineans and Aboriginal Australians."", 
""Another intriguing case: Almost all modern peoples of subequatorial Africa today are blacks who speak Bantu languages, closely related to the languages of West African farmers. Again, though, all subequatorial African peoples until around 2,000 years ago were hunter-gatherers similar to the few surviving subequatorial hunter-gatherer groups of Pygmies and Khoisan peoples."", ""How do you think Covid-19 will change history? Join the conversation below."", ""Both in Southeast Asia and in subequatorial Africa, archaeologists have assumed that denser populations and superior technology were what enabled Chinese or West African farmers to replace the indigenous hunter-gatherers. While that is undoubtedly part of the story, I’d suggest that the germs of the invading farmers and their domestic animals likely played a role too, infecting hunter-gatherers who had had no exposure to those diseases."", 
""What do the histories of these early epidemics tell us about the pandemic that the world is now enduring?"", ""One obvious conclusion is that Covid-19 is certain to have successors. Over the past 10,000 years, we humans acquired most of our infectious diseases from domestic animals. The main source of new diseases in recent decades has been large-scale contact with wild animals. China has closed its wild animal markets in response to Covid-19, but other points of contact remain: wild animal markets in other countries, the use of wild animals for traditional medicines and the African trade in bushmeat. As long as those routes remain open, we’re likely to see more diseases like Covid-19 in the near future."", 
""And many of them will probably become pandemics because of jet planes and other forms of mass travel. Covid-19 has circled the globe in a matter of months; the Black Death of the Middle Ages lacked the means to spread so widely."", ""Finally, there is the issue of who is suffering most from Covid-19. The big killers of history and prehistory have involved differential mortality: peoples with some genetic and acquired protection from previous exposure, who then infected and caused mass mortality among previously unexposed peoples with no protection."", 
""At first, it might seem that this doesn’t hold true for Covid-19. After all, the disease has existed for less than a year. No one had genetic protection or antibodies to protect them, which is why Covid-19 is killing people all around the world."", ""“\n        Covid-19 may increase inequality within and between countries.\n        ”"", ""But as we all know by now, there is differential mortality with Covid-19; it just has nothing to do with pre-existing genetic resistance or antibodies. We’re seeing big differences in mortality between population groups in the U.S.—between poor Native Americans and African-Americans, for example, and other Americans—related to differences in pre-existing health conditions. We’re seeing even bigger differences among American states (lower mortalities in Montana than in New York) and among countries (much lower mortalities in New Zealand, Germany and Vietnam than in Italy and the U.S.) because of differences in geography and government policy. When Covid-19 reaches its peak in India and Africa, we are likely to see further disparities, related to differences in national wealth and health-care systems."", 
""Covid-19 may thus increase inequality within and between countries. Inequality was causing big problems before the pandemic, of course, but now, thanks to modern travel and globalization, it means that poor, unhealthy, infected people will remain sources of re-infection for wealthy, healthy people."", ""A challenge for the future will be to ensure that face masks, vaccines, treatments and ventilators become available to everyone in the world. If they don’t become available, we shall all remain vulnerable. If they do become available, that global response to a global problem may inspire other global responses to other global problems. That would be a delayed benefit of the Covid-19 tragedy."",

Mr. Biden replied that he’d misheard the question and admitted he was “aware that there was, that they’d asked for, an investigation. But that’s all I know about it.”"",

In 2016 The FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation into Mr. Flynn, and it was under that pretense that it conducted the interview in which it later claimed that Mr. Flynn lied.

""Before most bigger shows can start up again, executives say there must be a vaccine or testing, tracing and treatment procedures to help public-health officials and concertgoers feel that huge crowds are safe. Even once big concerts return, they are likely to be different: Temperature checks, touchless ordering and hand-sanitizer stations could be the new norm."", ""“The hope is that we will have a big summer season in 2021,” says\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Joe Berchtold,\n\n\n\n      president of\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Live Nation Entertainment,\n\n\n      the world’s biggest concert promoter, which has lost 33% of its market value this year."", 
""For the concert industry, the shutdown has suspended a decadelong boom: Before coronavirus hit, live music was on track to generate nearly $30 billion in revenue this year, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLC."", ""Now, artists find themselves struggling to organize tours given differences in state laws as venues reopen. For consumers, there is a silver lining: Ticket prices are expected to fall."", ""Here, nine factors shaping the post-Covid concert:"", ""Neither artists nor fans like half-full concerts, no matter the venue."", 
""But in the months ahead, artists with less expensive stage shows—country performers, rappers, comedians—may perform for, say, 600 fans in a 1800-seat venue if necessary for social distancing. And instead of performing one big show, artists might perform multiple ones, says Rob Light, head of music at talent agency CAA."", ""As for major arena acts—the kind whose shows involve elaborate productions—some could temporarily downsize to smaller theaters or amphitheaters. Coachella, the world’s highest-grossing festival, remains scheduled for October, but top-tier summer and fall events continue to be rescheduled. On Tuesday, a stadium tour by Weezer, Green Day and Fall Out Boy was postponed to summer 2021."", 
""“The logical places to open first are the smaller, open-air” ones, says Jonathan Daniel, co-founder of Crush Music, a management firm whose clients include Weezer, Green Day, Fall Out Boy and Sia."", ""Would you go to a concert now? If not, what would make you feel comfortable about attending one? Join the discussion below."", ""After years of soaring prices—Ariana Grande, BTS and Post Malone each charged over $100 a ticket, on average, last year, while the Rolling Stones cost more than $200—concertgoers can expect them to fall a little."", 
""When the live-music business experienced a huge economic shock in 2008 the average ticket price went down 5% to 8% for three years straight, says Rick Mueller, president of North America for AEG Presents, the world’s No. 2 concert promoter."", ""Now, superstars who were charging sky-high prices may lower them; others may expand lower-cost options like lawn seats, while keeping their priciest seats high. There could be special deals for groups like nurses, says CAA’s Mr. Light."", ""At the same time, arena acts now playing theaters could charge more for the intimate experience."", 
""“It feels like it’s ground zero,” says Mike Luba, a live-events producer and artist manager. “We have to throw out everything… we’ve assumed for the last [few] decades.”"", ""The lockdown has helped fuel innovation—look at rap star Travis Scott’s brief concert in the multiplayer videogame Fortnite or experimental-pop duo 100 gecs’ “Square Garden” festival in the game Minecraft."", ""The most pioneering space has been in the hip-hop world, which has created novel online entertainment experiences. Perhaps the most popular is the Verzuz series of “beat battles” on Instagram Live, where hip-hop legends play tracks they were involved in during a lighthearted competition."", 
""For the most part, music executives consider efforts like paid livestreams, videogame appearances and drive-in concerts to be one-offs or novelties that let artists stay in touch with fans, yet don’t generate enough revenue to be meaningful to the industry. “Trying to play an actual concert [online] doesn’t work really well,” Mr. Daniel says."", ""However, the Verzuz series shows the possibility of events that are uniquely suited to a digital medium, experts say. And some executives see the potential for business even after live music returns."", 
"""", ""Reopening the touring business is likely to be a patchwork affair, with U.S. cities and states and other countries having different requirements. That will make routing tours a headache, artist managers say."", ""If an artist can’t easily string together 20 dates without interruptions, including major hubs like New York, they may just hold off. For others who head out, costs will be higher given additional spending on staff, buses and hotels. “It’s almost a little bit of ‘Swiss cheese’ touring,” says Traci Thomas, who manages artists including singer-songwriter Jason Isbell."", 
""One solution: Some artists may perform mini-residencies in one venue or play regionally, managers say."", ""Your favorite tiny club—the kind of place where you’re proud to say you saw an act before they got famous—could go under."", ""The National Independent Venue Association says 90% of its members may not survive if the shutdown lasts six months."", ""Ms. Thomas scheduled a club tour into next year for Oklahoma artist John Moreland. “Fingers crossed that those venues stay open,” she says."", 
"""", ""The concert industry is already highly consolidated, with Live Nation and AEG having taken over or partnered with many of the remaining independent promoters and venues in recent years. Still, if even fewer independents exist, the world’s two biggest promoters have more leverage over artists."", ""Shows with reduced crowds aren’t possible in arenas or stadiums without concert promoters suffering huge losses, executives say."", ""That’s because the cost of staging an arena concert is so high, promoters depend heavily on ticket sales and concessions like beer, food and parking to simply break even."", 
""“To open in earnest, I think [the business] is going to have to look a lot like it looked before we came offline,” says AEG’s Mr. Mueller. Hence the need for a vaccine or other procedures to eliminate health risks and ensure massive crowds."", ""The days of self-serve concession stands are over. Music lovers will experience new protocols at venues for safety and sanitation, especially around food and beverages, bathrooms and elevators."", ""“The way 9/11 changed our industry in terms of security… this will [lead to] best practices that our touring industry is compelled to employ forever,” says Dave Brown, chief operating officer of American Airlines Center, a 20,000-capacity arena in Dallas."", 
""Packaged foods will rule the day. Staff will frequently clean hand railings. Restroom capacities could be limited. And there will be hand-sanitizer stations. “You’ll be tripping over them,” Mr. Brown says."", ""Temperature checks, face masks and testing stations could become part of the concert experience, at least for a while."", ""Back in the pre-corona days, fans with deep pockets paid big bucks to meet with their favorite artists.  Smaller artists also started to offer pricey VIP packages, including meet-and-greets, that allow acts to maximize revenue from superfans."", 
""But with social distancing, it is likely few will feel the same about shaking hands. “I don’t think you’re going to see meet-and-greets for a long time,” says AEG’s Mr. Mueller."", ""For smaller artists, who often struggle to break even on tours, that will make it harder to stay in the black."", ""For artists, the crisis is changing how they are paid, with more acts taking a major share of box-office proceeds instead of getting upfront payments from promoters, executives say."", ""That protects the promoter if sales are disappointing or if huge refunds are doled out. For superstars who sell out arenas, it may not matter much; but for smaller acts navigating a tough economy, it makes touring riskier."", 
""“Everybody is going to be making a little less,” AEG’s Mr. Mueller says."", ""“This is going to be a multiyear process to get our health back,” says CAA’s  Mr. Light. “But we’ll come back.”"", ""Write to Neil Shah at neil.shah@wsj.com"", ""Copyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Users wearing the headset can connect to a real-time video feed of a doctor in a separate wing of the hospital, which is displayed to the user as a digital image floating in the real-world room.

But an emerging cultural and economic time bomb is about to explode. There has never been a wider gap between average Americans’ perception of their own economic situation and the reality of it. America could soon have its most combustible political environment in recent history."", ""Something that should alarm everyone: Neither the stock market nor the political preferences of those who have been hit hardest by this Covid-induced economic crisis have fundamentally changed since the crisis began. The American economy has shed more than 30 million jobs in the past eight weeks, and poll numbers haven’t moved an inch. According to Gallup, President Trump’s approval rating was 49% on Feb. 16, with 48% disapproving. Three months and the largest job loss in American history later, those numbers are exactly the same: 49% to 48%."",

But most of America is living in an illusion that masks the inevitable pain of this pandemic."", ""To the credit of the president and Congress, the Cares Act was passed before many Americans missed paychecks. The administration distributed the cash quickly enough that Americans had access to expanded unemployment compensation and a direct payment before their financial situation became dire. For the 40% of people making under $40,000 who have lost their jobs since March, according to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, the Cares Act ensured that their financial situation isn’t worse than it was in February. In some cases, it’s better, thanks to the $600-a-week unemployment bonus."",

It’s very problematic,” says Bruce J. Schwartz, deputy chair and professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Montefiore Medical Center in New York. “Many people do develop a dependency on these medications.”"", 
""Prescriptions for anti-anxiety medications, such as Klonopin and Ativan, rose 10.2% in the U.S. to 9.7 million in March 2020 from 8.8 million in March 2019, according to the latest data from health-research firm IQVIA. Prescriptions for antidepressants, including Prozac and Lexapro, rose 9.2% to 29.7 million from 27.2 million in the same period. The information doesn’t include data on whether dosages have increased along with prescriptions."", ""“\n        ‘If you’ve lost your job, if you’re worried if you’ll have enough food for your kids, that will keep you up at night.’ \n        ”"", 
""Some companies have seen more dramatic increases. Express Scripts, a pharmacy benefit manager owned by\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Cigna,\n\n\n      says prescriptions for anti-anxiety medications rose 34.1% between mid-February and mid-March, while prescriptions for antidepressants and sleep medications increased 18.6% and 14.8%, respectively. Ginger, which supplies video- and chat-based mental health services to companies, says its psychiatrists wrote 86% more prescriptions for psychotropic drugs, primarily antidepressants, in March and April 2020 compared with January and February."", 
""Health concerns, social isolation and the stress of job losses are taking a toll on people’s well-being. More than one-third of Americans say the pandemic is having a “serious impact” on their mental health, according to a survey released March 25 by the American Psychiatric Association. Among parents with children under 18, 46% rated their average stress level related to the pandemic as 8, 9 or 10 on a 10-point scale, according to a survey the American Psychological Association released May 21. The nation’s top mental-health official recently warned that the suffering could deepen if there were a second coronavirus lockdown."", 
""“This kind of chronic stress brings about, for all those people who have never had anxiety before, it sort of overwhelms them,” says Charles B. Nemeroff, professor and chair of the department of psychiatry at Dell Medical School at the University of Texas at Austin and president-elect of the Anxiety and Depression Association of America. “If you’ve lost your job, if you’re worried if you’ll have enough food for your kids, that will keep you up at night.” And for those with a history of anxiety and depression, stress can raise the risk of a relapse."", 
""The most popular anti-anxiety medications are benzodiazepines that include Valium, Xanax, Ativan and Klonopin. These drugs enhance the activity of the central nervous system’s main inhibitory neurotransmitter, GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid). GABA’s primary function is to reduce the activity of neurons. “They are powerful, and they are powerfully attractive in that they work instantly,” says James Potash, director of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Johns Hopkins Medicine. “You take Ativan, and 30 minutes later you are feeling dramatically less anxious.” Sleep medications like Lunesta and Ambien are similar to the benzodiazepines in that they also alter the activity of GABA. The neurotransmitter is thought to facilitate sleep."", 
""Doctors say that benzodiazepines can be a useful tool and are very effective for the short-term treatment of acute anxiety. Dr. Potash advises patients to limit their use to weeks, not months. The problem, he says, is that people can quickly develop a tolerance to their effects—sometimes in as little as two weeks—which can lead patients to increase the dose. This is especially the case with the shorter-acting drugs like Xanax, which are also abused as street drugs. The medications can be difficult to stop, too. Withdrawal symptoms can include a surge in anxiety, tremors and, in some cases, seizures. The medications can be particularly dangerous for older adults: In seniors, their use is associated with falls and cognitive problems."", 
""Because benzodiazepines can reduce the body’s drive to breathe, overdoses can be deadly. That is especially true when they are combined with alcohol and opioids. Overdose deaths involving benzodiazepines more than quadrupled between 1999 and 2013, according to a study published in 2016 in the American Journal of Public Health."", ""People can also develop a psychological dependence, says Beth Salcedo, a psychiatrist in Washington, D.C., and the past president of the Anxiety and Depression Association of America. “If you have a boatload of Xanax, and you are slightly anxious, and you take one, you feel better. Next time you are anxious, instead of taking care of what is making you anxious, you’re much more likely to reach for the Xanax,” she says. “It can very quickly become a habit.”"", 
""Dr. Salcedo recommends taking other steps to address anxiety, including “exercising, eating well, avoiding alcohol and making sure we surround ourselves with our social support as much as possible.” If anxiety is interfering with work or relationships, she advises turning to the most evidence-based treatments for anxiety disorders, which are cognitive behavioral therapy, a type of talk therapy, and antidepressant medications like Lexapro and Prozac. Since it can take several weeks for the effects of antidepressant medication or therapy to kick in, some doctors will use benzodiazepines briefly in the beginning of treatment to provide patients with immediate relief."", 
""Doctors have some of the same concerns with common sleep medications like Ambien and Lunesta as they do with the benzodiazepines, particularly when taken long term: They can be dangerous when combined with alcohol, and there are worries they can be addictive and abused. The drugs also come with side effects like daytime drowsiness, sometimes called the hangover effect."", ""For chronic sleep problems, experts recommend first trying cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, known as CBT-I. It typically includes “sleep restriction,” or limiting the amount of time people spend in bed when they are unable to sleep, and “stimulus control,” which means keeping the bedroom dedicated to sleep and sex."", 
""“Changing behavior is usually a healthier approach,” says Dr. Potash. “It is pretty much all upside and very little downside.”"", ""Write to Andrea Petersen at andrea.petersen@wsj.com"", ""Have you felt increased anxiety or stress during the pandemic?

Americans with obesity, diabetes, heart disease and other diet-related diseases are about three times more likely to suffer worsened outcomes from Covid-19, including death. Had we flattened the still-rising curves of these conditions, it’s quite possible that our fight against the virus would today look very different."", ""To combat this and future pandemics, we need to talk about not only the masks that go over our mouths but the food that goes into them. Next month, an expert committee will issue its advisory report on the federal government’s official dietary guidelines for the next five years. First published in 1980, the guidelines are meant to encourage healthy eating, but they have self-evidently failed to stem the ever-rising rates of obesity, diabetes and other chronic diseases in the U.S."", 
""Pills and surgery can treat the symptoms of such conditions, but diet-related problems require diet-related solutions. The good news is that changes in diet can start to reverse these conditions in a matter of weeks. In one controlled trial at the University of Indiana involving 262 adults with Type 2 diabetes, 56% were able to reverse their diagnosis by following a very low-carbohydrate diet, with support from a mobile app, in just 10 weeks. The results of this continuing study have been sustained for two years, with more than half the study population remaining free of a diabetes diagnosis."", 
""Other studies have found that dietary changes can rapidly and substantially improve cardiovascular risk factors, including conditions like hypertension that are major risk factors for worsened Covid-19 outcomes. A 2011 study in the journal Obesity on 300 clinic patients eating a very low-carbohydrate diet saw blood pressure quickly drop and remain low for years. And a 2014 trial on 148 subjects, funded by the National Institutes of Health, found a low-carb diet to be “more effective for weight loss and cardiovascular risk factor reduction” than a low-fat control diet at the end of the 1-year experiment."", 
""Since 2018, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and its European counterpart have considered a low-carb diet as one standard of care for people with Type 2 diabetes, in part because it lowers blood pressure and improves HDL, the “good” cholesterol. A 2019 ADA report stated that a low-carbohydrate diet “has demonstrated the most evidence for improving glycemia,” that is, for keeping blood sugars in check. This could be a crucial factor for avoiding Covid-19’s worst outcomes: In a paper just published in the journal Cell Metabolism, researchers found that among 7,337 Chinese patients diagnosed with Covid-19, well-controlled blood sugar was correlated with “markedly lower mortality” among those with Type 2 diabetes."",

Now, France’s top law enforcement official has released guidance suggesting that it could adopt an approach to corporate corruption and bribery championed by the country it once criticized."", ""The French Ministry of Justice this month sent a memo to prosecutors outlining how it plans to investigate and prosecute illegal bribes paid by French companies to secure business in foreign countries."", 
""The techniques and tools outlined closely resemble the ones used for nearly two decades in the U.S., where prosecutors have tried to encourage companies to detect and voluntarily disclose allegations of bribery, and reward the ones that do with more lenient settlements and discounts on fines."", ""The memo even hints that French prosecutors may do exactly what many in the country found so controversial about the U.S. approach: They could prosecute foreign companies for misconduct in countries outside of France, even if the companies have only tenuous links to France."",

So speedy was the recovery that eight months after patients first hit hospitals, Hong Kong was hosting a $100 million concert series featuring the Rolling Stones, Prince and Neil Young."", 
""But a closer look at SARS shows why this time a sharp recovery is unlikely—in Hong Kong or anywhere else."", ""Despite some similarities to Covid-19, SARS proved much easier to contain, and spread less broadly. The latest disease is more persistent and hard to detect, meaning reopenings will be slower and more tentative. And because the entire globe is infected, economies are less likely to fully revive until their trading, travel and business partners have recovered, as well."", ""At the depth of the SARS downturn during the second quarter of 2003, Hong Kong’s economic growth fell 2.4% from the previous quarter, before rebounding 6.1% in the third quarter. Although SARS pummeled some industries, including aviation, the impact was largely limited to Asia, and the epidemic barely registered in the global economy."",

Both tools debuted in March."", 
""“We had to respond very quickly for our clients,” said David Stern, Experity’s chief executive."", ""Established to offer quick diagnoses and treatments to walk-in patients, urgent-care clinics have emerged as the first go-to health resource for a growing number of Americans. There are about 10,000 urgent-care clinics nationwide, according to the Urgent Care Association, an industry group that represents about half of the clinics across the country. Over the past several years, many clinics have added more consumer-focused technology services, such as the ability for patients to check in and manage their care via mobile app, according to the association."", 
""Earlier this year, infection concerns forced clinics to shift their focus from in-person care toward telemedicine."", ""Experity, which provides software for managing patient records, electronic prescriptions, insurance payments and billing to about 5,700 clinics, worked with an undisclosed vendor to develop a telemedicine application in two weeks."", ""The Morning Download delivers daily insights and news on business technology from the CIO Journal team."", ""The idea for a telemedicine app had already been in the works prior to the pandemic but the company initially aimed to launch it at the end of the year, Dr. Stern said. Instead, the company offered it to customers in March."", 
""Other companies such as\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Teladoc Health Inc.\n\n\n      and Doctor on Demand Inc. have raced to add doctors and bandwidth for telemedicine services during the outbreak amid increased demand for the technology, which struggled to take hold before the pandemic."", ""In late May, about 85% of roughly 1,100 urgent-care clinics were providing telemedicine services, up from 29% in 2019, according to surveys and reports by the Urgent Care Association. Urgent-care clinics have used Experity and other software vendors to provide those telemedicine services."", 
""To date, about 120,000 patients have been seen via Experity’s telemedicine app, Dr. Stern said."", ""The company also launched a Covid-19 app for patients in March, which was built in three days. The app allows patients to answer questions about their symptoms and register for an appointment remotely without having to sit in the waiting room and potentially expose others to the virus."", ""“We reverted to startup mode and that allowed us to really rapidly develop it,” Dr. Stern said. Experity’s 40-person product team worked with its dozens of software engineers to build both products while working remotely."", 
""Working remotely has been relatively easy for the team, he said. Productivity, measured by the amount of projects that each team builds and executes, has increased by about 8% over the past three months, he said."", ""Dr. Stern said Experity’s competitive advantage is that its software is purpose-built for urgent-care clinics. Patient data can be easily viewed in the software through charts and other visuals that physicians can use to quickly look up patient histories and treat them, he said. Templates also allow physicians to quickly process and document a patient visit, he said."", 
""Experity was formed from the 2019 merger of DocuTAP and Practice Velocity. The company has 600 employees."", ""Because urgent-care clinics provide on-demand care, they have unique needs when it comes to software, said Laurel Stoimenoff, chief executive of the Urgent Care Association."", ""For example, they need to be able to quickly triage patients based on the severity of their medical conditions. They also need to make quick diagnoses, and software that’s easy to use and intuitive allows them to expedite that process. “Software that helps prompt a clinical decision is helpful because…the physician doesn’t know your long [medical] history,” Ms. Stoimenoff said."", 
""Software and technology for urgent-care clinics have drastically improved over the past decade, she said. When she first joined the association in 2004, the majority of patient records were still paper-based and health-care workers would sometimes have to pull them from storage units. X-ray records were stored on film instead of in digital formats, which were fire hazards, she said. Now, 86% of about 1,000 urgent-care clinics have a mobile app that patients can use to manage their care, according to an Urgent Care Association survey. That’s up from about 54% that indicated they had an online check-in system, either via website or mobile app, about five years ago, Ms. Stoimenoff said."",

The answer is yes,” said Bill Maris, the founder of Google Ventures, in 2015. Three years later, biomedical researcher Aubrey de Grey estimated that “people in middle age now have a fair chance” of never dying."", ""Eternal life through advanced technology seems like a pipe dream for a society that, until recently, had trouble manufacturing enough masks to save doctors’ and nurses’ lives. Yet Covid-19 may turn out to be just the kind of crisis needed to turbocharge efforts to create what its advocates call a “transhuman” future. With our biological fragility more obvious than ever, many people will be ready to embrace the message of the Transhumanist Declaration, an eight-point program first issued in 1998: “We envision the possibility of broadening human potential by overcoming aging, cognitive shortcomings, involuntary suffering and our confinement to planet Earth.”"", 
""Transhumanists, many of them associated with nonprofits and think tanks like Humanity Plus and the Extropy Institute, have long been driven by the fear that our entire species could be wiped out by nuclear war, asteroid collision, technological accident—or a pandemic. In March, as the coronavirus was spreading around the world, the science writer Tom Chivers observed that it proves the need for technological protection against such existential threats: “Humans could be around for a billion years, or more, if we don’t screw it up. Coronavirus won’t be the thing that kills us all, but it’s a bloody good illustration of how something could,” he wrote in the online magazine UnHerd."", 
""People have always feared death and dreamed of escaping it. But until now, that hope has been formulated in religious terms. Transhumanism promises that death can be conquered physically, not just spiritually; and the movement has the support of people with the financial resources to make it happen, if anyone can. Jeff Bezos, Peter Thiel and Elon Musk are among the Silicon Valley moguls who have invested in life-extension research. In 2013, Google entered the field by launching the biotech firm Calico, short for California Life Company."", 
""Transhumanists envision several possible avenues to immortality. Nanorobots could live inside our cells and constantly repair damage, halting aging in its tracks. Genetic engineering could eliminate the mechanisms that cause us to age in the first place. Such technologies are still out of reach, but transhumanists believe we will be able to master them sooner than most people think, with the help of superpowered artificial intelligence."", ""WSJ Membership"", ""Customer Service"", ""Tools & Features"",

I just got some good poll numbers."", ""Mr. Bender: Oh, did you?"", ""Mr. Trump: I think we’re doing good. So what’s up?"", ""Mr. Bender: Do you want to tell me about your poll numbers?"", ""Mr. Trump: We’re up in a lot of states. We’re looking very good in Ohio. Very good in Wisconsin. Very good in Florida. Yeah, I think we’re doing well. I mean, we haven’t started campaigning, you know. I have not, essentially, started. I guess you could say it starts on Saturday, right? What’s the word on that?"",

""Mr. Trump: OK. Good."", ""Mr. Bender: So have you been pushing to do a rally? It’s been a while."", ""Mr. Trump: These are judges, look. (Mr. Trump holds up a stack of documents that, once signed, will formally nominate individual judges.) So we’ll be up to, oh, I don’t know, 254 or something very soon. This a United States district judge, district—New Mexico. All judges. Nobody’s done anything like that one, right?"", ""Mr. Bender: That’s a lot of judges."", ""Mr. Trump: The judge situation, yeah. I think we’re doing... Do you mind if I sign this while we talk?"", 
""Mr. Bender: No. Sounds good. Go ahead. A little multitasking? Well, maybe we can just talk about the rally for just a second. What do you think about some of the risks from coronavirus?"", ""Mr. Trump: Well, one of the reasons we chose the location, Oklahoma is they’ve done very well, with respect to the rally—with respect to the…they have a really good arena, but they’ve done very well, with respect to the, I call it the plague. The plague that was sent by China. And I think that, you know, the numbers are very small. They said there’s a spike, the spike is, I wish Mike (Pence) were here because he was showing me the numbers before. It’s like, very few people. And I think they’re in great shape. But I would even say the spike ends, has already ended. So I think we’re going to do very well, you know. I think we’re going to do well. I think it’s time to start our country up again, basically. And could we keep it shut longer? Personally, I don’t think so. I don’t think people would take it. And I think it would be the wrong thing to do. We have great retail numbers. I mean, it’s the early surge. We have great retail numbers. It was supposed to, I guess, 7... they were estimating 7%. We’re going to be 17.7%."", 
""So I think that it’s going to be great. I think we’re gonna have a really good third quarter. This quarter, as you know, what’s going on now we’re finishing out the results of what we had to do. So the third quarter’s really our first quarter where we can show something and I think, I mean, based on the numbers, the employment numbers you saw, we’re good. Beyond good. Actually, I think they were reported as the best numbers in history, best employment quarter in history. Best employment month in history."", 
""Mr. Bender: How low can you get the employment rate by November?"", ""Mr. Trump: Well, I think we can get tremendous numbers of jobs by November. I think by the end of the year, we’re going to have a vast number of jobs, largely…shortly thereafter, we should be almost where we were. And I think ultimately next year is going to be a fantastic year. I think next year is going to be a really fantastic year. You know, I was predicting the V, right? You know that. From the beginning. And now everybody’s saying I’m right. And we’ll see. We’ve got tremendous momentum. Now, it’ll be interesting to see where that momentum goes now. We were riding really straight through. Doing great. And then we got hit by the China virus. And frankly, we’re starting a little bit of a different campaign. Now it’s about jobs. Before it was about other things, but basically before it was about keeping it where it was. Now it’s about having it go up. And it will go up. I think you’ll see big GDP increases. I think you’ll see big jobs increases. And I think you’re going to see big retail sales increases, which you’ve already seen. So if you look at the two, the two stats that have come out…Two weeks ago, you had the job numbers, which were the biggest monthly gain in history. And yesterday, you had the retail sales numbers, which was the biggest, the biggest gain—17.7%—in history. And the estimate, I guess, was 6%, 6 to 7%. And it was 17.7%. So the numbers are looking much better than people thought."", 
""Mr. Bender: That’s true. I’m sure you’ve seen the statistics, though, about how it relates to elections."", ""Mr. Trump: About how what does?"", ""Mr. Bender: Jobs numbers and unemployment."", ""Mr. Trump: How it would relate to my chances for reelection? Yeah, you know, the sad thing is that I was sailing. You understand? That was a free shot. Now, I mean, if you look at it, people say, “He got us there once, he’s going to get us there again.” That was the greatest economy, the greatest job numbers we’ve ever had. We were up to almost 160 million jobs. Nobody was ever close. But now I just have to start building it up again. We started. And I think that the numbers are beyond anybody’s expectations."", 
""Mr. Bender: Do you think you can get the unemployment rate below 8% by Election Day?"", ""Mr. Trump: I don’t know. We’ll have a lot of jobs before November 3. I mean, all I can say is this: We will have created a lot of jobs prior to November 3. Tremendous number of jobs, a tremendous increase, I expect a tremendous increase in GDP. And we’ll be heading you know, for the top. We’ll be back. And we’ve had a lot of advantages, a lot of experience. We did it once and we’ll do it again. Bottom line is we did it once, and you would agree. Best job numbers, best economy, best everything we’ve ever had. China, we were beating China badly."", 
""China, last year, would have had the worst year they’ve ever had in many, many years and decades. And that was because I put a lot of tariffs on China that they never wanted. And I don’t want them to have bad years, but they happened to have a very bad year last year. And that’s before the virus. Now, of course they didn’t even report their numbers this year. You know, they refused to report their numbers, right? But last year was a bad year for China, one of one of the very bad years that they’ve had. And that’s largely because I put tariffs on. Nobody ever put tariffs on them. Nobody ever did anything to China. China walked away from Obama-Biden. No tariffs, no downside, no nothing. Whereas we took in billions of dollars of tariffs, and they were all put on by me. And they don’t follow the phase one deal—it’s a phase one deal—if they don’t follow it, I would substantially raise the tariffs, if that were necessary. So far, I think they’re…I haven’t had the final report but it looks like they are. They’re buying a lot."", 
""Mr. Bender: Speaking of China, there is a lot about China in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      John Bolton’s\n\n\n\n      new book. And trade. And he makes a lot of accusations about you prioritizing trade over the enforcement of sanctions when it comes to ZTE, and Huawei."", ""Mr. Trump: Well look how tough I’ve been on Huawei. Nobody has been tougher than me on Huawei. Look at what’s going on with Huawei. I mean, we’ve convinced other nations not to do business with them. Whether it’s U.K. or Italy or others. We can give you all the list. Nobody has ever been so tough on a company as I have to Huawei. … So, nobody has been tough on Huawei like me, and there’s nobody been tough on China like me. Now, I don’t know what Bolton has said. I haven’t seen it yet."", 
""But Bolton is a disgruntled guy who made tremendous mistakes. He was one of the architects of the Middle East policy. And the only thing I liked about Bolton was that everybody thought he was crazy. And frankly, when you walk into the room with him, you’re in a good negotiating position. Because they figure you’re going to war if John Bolton was there. He wanted to go to war with everybody. He never saw a war he didn’t like. He made a tremendous mistake. You know, he and the people that he was pushing, when he went into the Middle East,  when he went into Iraq That was a terrible mistake. There were no weapons of mass destruction. That was John Bolton."", 
""He wanted the job so badly. He couldn’t get approved by the Senate. It was a non-Senate confirmed…he couldn’t get a Senate confirmed job. And by the way, he didn’t the first time. Did you know that? He wasn’t Senate-confirmed the first time. No. But I view him as a disgruntled employee. Very unhappy. Hated to leave. He was basically a man who was not happy to be leaving. Was not happy to be leaving. He had a lot of policy disputes, he and I."", ""And after the first month or so, you know, I asked him one question. I said, “So, do you think you did the right thing by going into Iraq?” He said, “Yes.” And that’s when I lost him. And that was early on. That’s when I lost him. But no, I disagreed with much of the stuff he said. He was one of many people. I liked listening to many people, and then doing whatever is the right thing to do."", 
""Mr. Bender: You didn’t ask him about Iraq before you brought him into the White House? If he regretted that?"", ""Mr. Trump: No, but it didn’t…I knew all about his policy on Iraq. But that didn’t matter, frankly. Because he made a terrible mistake. And so did everybody else involved in Iraq and the Middle East, frankly. I never thought it was the right thing to do. And I’ve been proven right. But when he told me he still thinks it was the right thing to do, and was unable to explain it to me, I said, “Explain that to me, because I don’t think you can.’ And he could not explain it to me. So I said, “Do you say that just to make yourself feel good? Or do you say that because you really believe it?” He said, “I really believe it.” I said, “Well, then you’ve lost me because it’s just wrong.”"", 
""Mr. Bender: You’ve talked about how your viewpoint on the trade deal has changed a little bit after coronavirus."", ""Mr. Trump: Yeah."", ""Mr. Bender: In the book, Bolton says that you wanted to lift the penalties off ZTE as part of a trade negotiation."", ""Mr. Trump: Well, he wasn’t here there for that. ZTE was my deal. I put the fine on them. And I’ve never seen anything quite like it. I essentially closed them up. That was me. Obama didn’t do it. That was me. I closed them up. And then we settled with them. We let them make a deal fairly shortly thereafter. They paid over a billion dollar fine, and agreed to board changes and all sorts of other things. So an unbelievable deal. It was short. Do you know what I’m talking about? I don’t know exactly what the timing was. And then immediately the Democrats say, Oh, you should have gotten more. I said, wait a minute, this is my deal. So I closed them up. What was it, Michael, like $1.2 billion?"", 
""Mr. Bender: I don’t remember exactly."", ""Mr. Trump: We’ll go back and find it. Something like $1.2 billion. So I close them up. They paid a tremendous amount in fines. I don’t know what it was. I think it was over a billion dollars. And they opened up. But we also got them to change their board as I remember it and the management and other things. So ZTE was great. Now, as always the Democrats, when you go in and you say “Hey, I got a billion dollars or whatever was...”"", ""Kayleigh McEnany, White House press secretary: It was $1.3 billion."", 
""Mr. Trump: $1.3 billion For nothing. Listen to this: I closed them, essentially. I said, we’re not going to do business. They come and ask: how do we get out of this? I ask them for a lot of money. They pay $1.3 billion and other things, not just $1.3. And then the Democrats say, Oh, you could have gotten more. They didn’t do it. Do you understand? They didn’t do it. I did it. So we pick up $1.3 billion in fines. And it’s an amazing deal. Now the Democrats will say, Oh, because .... Iif by the way, if I got $10 billion in fines, if I got $200 billion, if I ended up owning Beijing for $1, they would have said: The deal is not good enough, because that’s what they always say."", 
""Any deal you make, they’ll say it’s good enough. Like with the policemen. They say, Oh, you could have made a better deal, you know. And perhaps I’d say the same thing with them."", ""Mr. Bender: I guess I wonder about your perspective on the trade deal now, especially given the moves you made on ZTE and, in the book, Bolton says that you effectively gave your blessing to President Xi to continue building camps for the Uighur Muslims."", ""Mr. Trump: No, that’s not true. That’s not true."", 
""In fact, I approved a deal—a reprimand, etc, etc—from Congress. That’s been done. It’s been all done. It’s been signed. But I approved. The deal came in from Congress recently. And it’s been going along in Congress. I could have killed that very easily. All I would have to do is make a statement that I’m against it."", ""Mr. Bender: That was today that you signed that."", ""Mr. Trump: No, but this has been going in Congress for a long time. And I could have fought it. And I would have won. But I didn’t fight that deal."", 
""Mr. Bender: Bolton and Pompeo and Pence all wanted you to sanction China for detention of these minorities, but you were reluctant because of what it meant for the trade deal. And I guess what I’m wondering is now that you sort of have a different viewpoint on the trade deal, do you regret..."", ""Mr. Trump: No, I think the trade deal is a great deal. But ever since we got hit with the Chinese plague, I feel different toward everything having to do with China. And I’ve always been hardline on China."", 
""Bolton never told me to do tariffs on China. Bolton never thought you could get any tariffs done on China. Bolton has no economic sense. Bolton never thought you could get tariffs on China. They paid us billions of dollars. I gave our farmers $12 billion and $16 billion dollars out of tariffs I took in from China, which were much more than that. You understand? Because they were targeted. The farmers were targeted. Bolton never thought you could get—most people never thought you could get tariffs. I even, in the deal, we left a lot of the tariffs in the deal—big portions of the tariffs. I think 25%. Nobody thought you could make a deal like that. Because we got the deal, and we got the tariffs. But since we got hit with the virus, I have a very different perspective on China. Very different perspective. And I view it very differently. But nobody has been tough on China like I am. And you know that."", 
""Look under Obama and Biden, they got away with murder. This should have been... What I’ve been doing to China should have been done a long time ago. Obama-Biden never... They just came in and it was pillage. It was terrible. And they should have done something like what I’ve done. But we’ve taken in billions of dollars and by the way, they devalued their currency in order to pay for the tariffs. They devalued and they put up, they paid money. Otherwise their product wouldn’t have sold because the tariffs would have made their product too expensive. But the deal we made with China was a good deal, but I feel differently. The ink was barely dry when we got hit with the virus, and I view that I view that whole deal differently now. I view the relationship with China differently than"", 
""Mr. Bender: I do want to ask a couple questions about China. But just one more Bolton’s book, and then I’ll move on. Pompeo has a very big role in this book. Bolton writes that Pompeo told him multiple times he was close to resignation. He says Pompeo passed him a note during your meeting with\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Kim Jong Un\n      \n\n\n\n      saying that you were full of shit."", ""Mr. Trump: Who is full of shit?"", ""Mr. Bender: You, sir."", ""Mr. Trump: I would doubt that.

I have a very good relationship with Pompeo. He’s right now having an important meeting with somebody at their request. Do you know that?"", ""Mr. Bender: No, I didn’t know that. With who?"", ""Mr. Trump: No. Now, I have a very good relationship with... The one who has a bad relationship with Pompeo was Bolton. Did you know that? Pompeo and Bolton had a terrible relationship. What, you don’t see that? How does that come out in the book?"", 
""Mr. Bender: Bolton casts a critical eye toward just about everybody in your White House."", ""Mr. Trump: Everybody in the White House hated John Bolton, that I could see. There might have been some people. (To Mr. Meadows:) Did you deal with him at all? Yeah, you did. You think he’s terrible."", ""Mr. Meadows. Yes, I did. John Bolton is very self important. And you can quote me on that."", ""Mr. Trump: And not very smart."", ""Mr. Meadows: The best way this book could be described is, “In The Room Where It Didn’t Happen.” Because nothing that he touched ever happened, because he couldn’t find consensus."", 
""Mr. Trump: And with a short period of time, as we all got to know him because I didn’t know him very well. I didn’t know him at all before this. I figured, eh, he’s a hardliner. I like having a hardliner. He’s a hardliner, but I call him a stupid liner, because it was so foolish."", ""I could tell you things that he wanted to do that if we would have done them, we would have ended up on our own Iraq, a nice new version of Iraq."", ""Mr. Bender: What’s an example of that?"", ""Mr. Trump: I don’t want to say. I’ll have to say when I write my book, but nobody cares about Bolton. I would say this, look, he was somebody that wasn’t liked at all, and wasn’t respected very much. As we got to know him, he was respected less and less. Personally, I thought he was crazy. And other than the fact that he goes out and writes a book when he shouldn’t be writing a book, you know. You don’t leave and then write a book. And he’s got, you know, I think he’s got a lot of legal problems for doing it. I think he’s got probably a lot of legal problems. He should not have done what he did. But you don’t leave the office and go out and write a book about a current administration that’s doing well, but about a current administration. Who would ever think of doing something like that?"", 
""Mr. Bender: So, he does address that in the book. And the reason he says he wants this book out now is to essentially warn conservatives. He describes your reelection as the last guardrail on you in the White House, and worries that Democrats may enjoy your second term more than conservatives. Do you want to address that point and..."", ""Mr. Trump: Well, sure. Look, I’m signing now, in front of you, judges. All judges. I won’t give you the names. All judges...  Texas, New York, Minnesota. I’m signing off judges. We’re going to have potentially close to 300 judges including DC It’ll be close to 300. Nobody’s close. They’re all conservaative, highly respected judges. They’re going to be there for many years. They’re all young. They’re all conservative. They’re all very smart. And they’re getting great reviews. If I did nothing else, that’s good. Plus, I put two Supreme Court judges in that are excellent people. But if I did nothing else, and it’s really amazing because if I wasn’t here, those judges go to super liberal, young, smart judges, okay? Super liberal radical left. And you won’t have your Second Amendment any longer. And you will have a view on life that’s much different than the view on life now. That will change. And you won’t be spending money on the military. I’ve totally rebuilt the military. It’s the strongest it’s ever been. All made in the U.S.A.er $2 trillion, right. I created the Space Force. I got Anwar done, that even Reagan couldn’t get done. I got the biggest tax cuts in the history of our country. I got the biggest regulation cuts in the history of our country. I’ve done things that no administration has ever done in the first three and a half years."", 
""Mr. Bender: It’s been a very active four years. I can..."", ""Mr. Trump: No, give me a list. Look at her (Mr. Trump’s assistant enters the Oval Office with a list of Mr. Trump’s accomplishments.) She’s so unbelievable. She is so quick. I look up and she’s walking in with a list. Look at that."", ""Take this and read it. OK, because honestly, this is page after page of things that I’ve done. Just take this and read it. It’s pretty amazing. Added 2.5 million jobs. This is recently: 2.5 million jobs in May shattering the expectation that we will lose 10 million jobs. We’re going to lose 10 million, unfortunately, for the critics, we Retail Sales up 17.7%, which is the largest in history, job gains last month was the largest increase ever. Nearly 300 jobs were created for African-Americans last month. 75% of small businesses are now open. That’s a big number. It was estimated would be a much lower number. S&P 500 had the best 50 days in history. The was a week before actually...  And this was a good week. So I guess that continues. Nasdaq hit 10,000 for the first time, an all time record. Nasdaq, that was three, four days ago. In the middle of the pandemic, not in the middle toward the end of the pandemic. In my opinion. Hope I’m right. Saved the New York Times The Washington Post and cable television. I put that in for fun, but I did, it’s true. Because when I’m here when I’m not here... Maybe not The Wall Street Journal, but much of the media is going out of business. Because if you have to cover sleepy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Joe Biden\n      \n\n\n\n      who’s dead from the neck up, if you have to cover sleepy Joe Biden, I don’t think it’s gonna be too exciting."", 
""Mr. Bender: Well, what would you say is a new priority for the second term? One new initiative."", ""Mr. Trump: Well, it would have been much different if you asked me that question three months ago, because the economy was really rocking. And I would have been cutting debt. I would have been cutting expenses. I would have been cutting a lot of things. It would have been, you know, different. Now the new priorities: Building the economy to a point where it was plus, because we’re gonna have a better economy than it was. Because of certain things I’m doing. So if you would have asked me the question three months ago, I would have said reducing debt and building a, you know, just a continuation of what I’m doing now. Now you’re asking me the question, and now it’s building a really strong, powerful economy. And I think next year we can have a better...  we can have one of the best years we’ve ever had."", 
""And don’t forget so far I’ve been right. Now, you know, you may come to see me in a couple of months... And Michael’s always been fair, I don’t mind, you know, seeing you. You’ve always treated me well. Sometimes he’s treated me fairly. But when I explained it to him, he’s treated me fairly. When I’m not here to explain it to him, it’s a little different, I told them."", ""I said there’s going to be a V. And everybody is now saying that I was right."", ""Mr. Bender: You’ve kind of described it as a snapback, that once the economy reopens all these jobs come back. But is there something you plan on..."", 
""Mr. Trump: That’s because it was an artificial closing. It wasn’t like a bad, horrible recession that takes years to develop and it just starts tumbling downhill, and it takes 15 years to recover as it did with the Great Depression and some really big recessions and it would take 10,15 years to recover."", ""Mr. Bender: A lot of economists say it will take a while to come back. Several decades of job growth have been lost in the last couple months. My question is whether you have a new initiative in mind to re-energize the economy, to bring back jobs and get people back to work, in a second term?"", 
""Mr. Trump: So aside from everything else when we got rid of Nafta, which was a disaster. We have a great USMCA now. And in addition, we are making much better trade deals that we had in the past. If you look at Japan, they’re buying $40 billion worth of stuff. And building many car plants here. Germany is doing the same thing. Germany has to do what they’re doing, you know, building plants. They’re always difficult, frankly. And we’re reducing our troops in Germany because it’s costing us a lot of money and they’re delinquent on their payments. You know, they’re delinquent on their NATO payments. They owe a lot of money. Germany owes a lot of money. They don’t pay their bills. They’re supposed to be paying 2% and they’re paying 1%. If that, and it’s not fair. So we’re supposed to defend Germany from Russia, right? And yet Germany pays Russia billions of dollars for energy. How does that work? Right? So, you know. So, we’ve made, we’ve made great trade deals. And I was about to make the best trade deal of all, we’re all set to go. and then we got hit by the pandemic. If we didn’t get hit by the pandemic, we would have some additional trade deals that would have been unbelievable, including with the European Union."", 
""But instead of doing that, everybody was being very conservative and heading for the shelters."", ""Mr. Bender: You’ve talked about holding China accountable for coronavirus. Do you think they sat on that information about the virus in order to tank other economies around the world?"", ""Mr. Trump: They did something because if you look, they had very little outbreak, although now they seem to have an outbreak in Beijing, which is interesting, as of yesterday. But everybody knew they had it. I acted very early. I closed our country to China."", 
""By the way, Bolton disagreed. He thought we shouldn’t do it, okay? He didn’t think and you know, I was in a room full of people. You were there. And of the people, I don’t know of anybody that thought I should do it. That was a decision I made because I was seeing and hearing that China has a big problem. So they have a big problem, a big contagious problem, a problem of contagion to put it a different way, right? And I closed our country in January, the end of January, I closed our country to China.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Nancy Pelosi\n      \n\n\n\n      was dancing in the streets of Chinatown at the end of February."", 
""Mr. Bender: Did you consult with Bolton on coronavirus?"", ""Mr. Trump: No. I lost respect for Bolton’s intellect fairly early in the process. It wasn’t a big deal to me because frankly, he was good for me to use in negotiations because everyone thought he was crazy and he would go to war."", ""Mr. Bender: Was that effective? Was there an instance where you felt having Bolton in the room paid off in a negotiation?"", ""Mr. Trump: When people saw Bolton in the room, they figured probably he was stupid enough to go to war all the time. You know, he was a guy that I could tell you, if I would have listened to him, you and I would be in World War Three right now. He’s crazy. He’s crazy, and I think he’s not smart. But you know what I’m talking about right?"", 
""Mr. Meadows: Yes I do, sir."", ""Mr. Trump: He wanted to do things that were insane."", ""Mr. Bender: Like what?"", ""Mr. Trump: I don’t want to tell you that. Maybe I’ll tell you, you know, at a later date. But he had no touch. He had no feel. And I think he, you know, just had little intellect. He was also somebody who, just, people didn’t like him. Nobody in the office liked him. Nobody wanted to be with him. Nobody wanted to talk much with him. And I realized early on, as I was saying before to Michael, was when I asked him the question, so John, you were one of the people that were really pushing hard to go into the Middle East, to go into Iraq. Would you do it again? He said, Yes. And that’s where I said this guy is crazy."", 
""Mr. Bender: That was only after a month?"", ""Mr. Trump: Yeah, I don’t know. But it was very early on. I was talking to him. I said, So was that a mistake? I said, and it’s okay to admit you made a mistake, although that’s a big one. That’s a beauty. And I said, Do you think it was a mistake? And he said, No, I think it was the right thing to do. And I said, You know, you can’t explain that. You just can’t explain it. So anyway,"", ""Mr. Bender: Maybe points for honesty?"", ""Mr. Trump: That’s very interesting. Or maybe points for stupidity? I can figure out which. Oh, wait, you take this. (Mr. Trump offers his print out of accomplishments.)"", 
""You can add on to what I said. Tried to deal with a Nafta. By the way. One thing. It wasn’t Bolton that killed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      al Baghdadi.\n\n\n\n      It wasn’t Bolton that killed Soleimai. … Bolton might say, oh, Trump wasn’t tough enough on China and wasn’t tough enough on this. I know that kind of shit, because he lied a lot. He is a liar. Nobody was tougher in China. Nobody was tougher on Iran. Nobody’s been tougher on anything. We’ll see how North Korea works out. … It’s early in that whole situation. So we’ll see. You know, in the meantime, he expected to be in war. OK. We’re not in war. What have we given up? Nothing. Have we reduced sanctions? No. Have we done anything? No. And the fake news video—total phony media would say, Oh, Trump’s give it up a lot. Really what have I given up? Nothing. … Okay. A few more Mike."", 
""Mr. Bender: Just a couple on coronavirus and I want to make sure to as you a little about your police reforms."", ""Mr. Trump: On coronavirus, I acted very quickly, and I acted early. And they can’t get over it. Number one. Number two. If I didn’t act, we would have had 3 million deaths. And instead we’re at 110,000. And we could be heading to a number that’s, you know, higher than 150,000 to 200,000, it could be ending all now depending on how it goes. We’re doing very well on vaccine. We’re doing very well on therapeutic. But if I didn’t do what we did, we would have anywhere from 1.5 million to 3 million deaths. That would be 20 times more than we’ll end up having, you know? 10 to 30 times more."", 
""Mr. Bender: It sounds like you’re very tuned in to what’s happening in China and in the second waves that are happening there. There was a spike a couple weeks ago in Wuhan…"", ""Mr. Trump: Well, first of all they don’t... We did an incredible thing, not since the Second World War. We had very few ventilators in our country. You couldn’t get them because every country was desperate for ventilators. We went into the ventilator-making business and now we have thousands of ventilators being made every week. And we’re helping other countries with ventilators. On the medical equipment, same thing. We’re with making a lot. I was up in Maine the other day. I don’t know if you were there. The lines of people on the street in Maine... That was a swab plant. But we’re making a lot of our own stuff now. And very importantly, our testing is so far advanced of any other country. And that’s a good thing and a bad thing. Here’s what’s bad about it."", 
""We tested I think, 20 some odd million people now, right? No country is even close to that. You look at 4 million, maybe 5 million in Germany, no country’s even close to 20 million. The problem is when you test, you’re finding cases, you’re finding kids that had it and you know, etc, etc."", ""Mr. Bender: Why is that a problem?"", ""Mr. Trump: Well, the problem is because we’re showing cases whereas other countries that don’t have testing capacity, they don’t show cases. So they say the United States has more cases than anybody else. That’s because we do more testing. If we use the same testing that I used in China, or in Iran, or in some of these larger countries, it would blow us away. First of all, China doesn’t report it’s testing.…"", 
""So I do say they contained it. Now, just the last little day and it’s all of a sudden turning that maybe it wasn’t contained. But it seems to have been contained in China. And why was it contained in China? But the Chinese people that were infected go to Europe and go all over the world?"", ""Mr. Bender: What’s the answer to that question, Mr. President?"", ""Mr. Trump: Well, that’s what I’m trying to find out."", ""Mr. Bender: What do you think it is?"", ""Mr. Trump: There is a very good chance it was incompetence. There was a very good chance it was a mistake. And there’s a chance that it was intentional."", 
""Mr. Bender: You think that is a lesser chance?"", ""Mr. Trump: Yeah I think so. Because I don’t think I don’t think they would do that. But you never know. But it has had an impact."", ""Mr. Bender: And that would be to spread the economic consequences around the globe?"", ""Mr. Trump: Correct. They’re saying, man, we’re in a mess. The United States is killing us. Don’t forget, my economy during the last year and a half was blowing them away. And the reason is the tariffs."", ""Mr. Bender: Is that your gut on that? Or do you have intelligence that they may have pushed this beyond their border?"", 
""Mr. Trump: It’s my sense that could have happened. I hope not. And I hope we’ll be able to find it out."", ""Mr. Bender: The Wuhan question I wanted to ask about the spike there, which resulted in them testing almost all 11 million people in 9 days. If there was a second spike in New York or Michigan, would you push to test everyone in New York, everyone in Michigan?"", ""Mr. Trump: No, I wouldn’t. I personally think testing is overrated, even though I created the greatest testing machine in history. I’ve created the greatest testing machine in history. And I think testing is overrated."", 
""Mr. Bender: Why is that?"", ""Mr. Trump: Because I think you’ll have it and you’ll test. I’m not saying testing is bad. And certainly you test people and you want to see whether or not they have it. But the testing can lead to a lot of mistakes also. Look, if we didn’t test all the cases that we’re reporting, you wouldn’t know about any of those cases. In many ways, it makes us look bad. The fact that we’re so good at something makes us look bad. But having the ability to test is…has helped us a lot. But don’t forget we report every single death.…We report every case. So, if we test 20 times more than some other country, we’re going to find cases. They call them cases. And that’s only because our testing is much better."", 
""Mr. Bender: You think testing is overrated because it adds to the caseload?"", ""Mr. Trump: No, not for that reason. I just think that what you have to do is be careful, regardless. You have to be careful. You have a certain population... we now know that elderly people, especially elderly people that have a problem such as heart disease, or various…they’re literally listed, okay? They’re literally listed. Diabetes, heart disease, I think would be number one and two. But they’re listed. If they’re elderly, and they have those diseases, it’s not easy. It’s not gonna be pleasant. OK? So we know where we should protect. We had a number of governors that did a very, very poor job with respect to nursing homes, a very, very poor job. And they should have known better."", 
""Mr. Bender: You also don’t seem to like masks very much. Do you think people are protesting you when they wear them?"", ""Mr. Trump: Masks are a double-edge sword. People touch them. And they grab them and I see it all the time. They come in, they take the mask. Now they’re holding it now in their fingers. And they drop it on the desk and then they touch their eye and they touch their nose. No, I think a mask is a…it’s a double-edged sword. It’s a double-edged sword. I see Biden. It’s like his whole face is covered. It’s like he put a knapsack over his face. He probably likes it that way. He feels good that way because he does. He seems to feel good in a mask, you know, feels better than he does without the mask, which is a strange situation."", 
""Mr. Bender: You’ve commented on Biden’s mask a few times, and a couple of reporters who wear masks. Do you view that as a protest of you? Do you feel like people wear masks to show their disapproval of you?"", ""Mr. Trump: It could be, yeah. It could be. But it could also be they feel better about it. I mean, I’m okay with it. Look, I’m okay with it. But the mask is a double-edged sword and I see it. People come in, they’re talking through the mask for hours. They probably don’t clean them after, you know, they get a little cocky, right? Then they take the mask, they put their finger on the mask, and they take them off, and then they start touching their eyes and touching their nose and their mouth. And then they don’t know how they caught it."", 
""Mr. Bender: One of my sisters is a nurse and she’s described this as a false sense of security that it gives people."", ""Mr. Trump: It’s possible. It could be a false sense of security. But think of it, they’re touching it. I watch them all day long. They’re playing with it. You watch some of these politicians, they start talking, they take their fingers and they put them inside the mask and they rip it down. Now their fingers are infected. Potentially. And then they touch their nose. They touch their eyes, they touch their mouth. Voilà."", 
""Mr. Bender: So it’s okay if your supporters wear masks at the rally?"", ""Mr. Trump: Absolutely. They can wear them or not. I want them to be happy. We’re gonna have a good time. Yeah, I want them to be happy."", ""Mr. Bender: What happens if your supporters get sick at one of these rallies?"", ""Mr. Trump: Well, people have to know that, yes, you do. But it’s tiny. You know, it’s a very small percentage. We did the right thing. We closed it down. We closed it down. Expensive. But you can’t put a price on saving millions of lives. We saved millions of lives. You know, a lot of people say herd. Well how did herd work for Sweden? No good. How did herd work for Brazil? No good."", 
""Mr. Bender: Let me put it in personal terms. Would you be okay if a family member of yours, if Ivanka wanted to go sit in the crowd at your rally?"", ""Mr. Trump: Yeah I would. I would be. Well, first of all, she’s young. And this really is a disease…I was with the governor of New Jersey the other night, because he wants to do a big bridge in New Jersey that they’ve been trying to finance for 50 years. And I approved it. Very expensive bridge in New Jersey. They need it. It’s been a real problem. You know the bridge. And he was telling me something that was shocking. He said they’ve had.. how many people died in New Jersey?"", 
""Ms. Farah: I don’t know exactly. But New York and New Jersey are one-quarter of the cases"", ""Mr. Trump: Thousands of people. They lost one person under 18. Hey, would you find out the number of deaths in New Jersey? The state of New Jersey. It was only a few days ago. So they lose one person under 18, he said. I said that’s amazing. That’s why the schools have to open. But the people that are at risk are our older professors, and they’re gonna have to be careful, Maybe not be there initially or maybe have, you know, be behind some kind of a protective shield."", 
""But this was brought to us by China. Just came in from China, and should have never happened because they could have stopped it."", ""Mr. Bender: Can I ask just a couple questions on the George Floyd fallout?"", ""Mr. Trump: Sure"", ""Mr. Bender: Do you think that there’s systemic racism in the country?"", ""Mr. Trump: In the country?"", ""Mr. Bender: Yes. In America."", ""Mr. Trump: Hopefully not. But there’s always something going on that’s bad, because there’s always something going on. Here, let me just see that for a second. (Mr. Trump’s assistant hands the president a chart with the number of coronavirus deaths, which total about 12,800.)"", 
""OK. Yeah. So, that number. When he mentioned he said 12,500. So he said at 12,500, one person died under the age of 18. So I think that a lot of these are older persons. So I’m very happy I’m young and in perfect condition. OK?"", ""Mr. Bender: You said you hope there’s not systemic racism. Do you think there is?"", ""Mr. Trump: I would like to think there is not. Yeah, I would like to think there is not such systemic racism. And it would be whatever I can do to make myself correct on that thought, I’d like to do it. Now, unfortunately, in the real world, there is some. But I would like to, whatever I could do to reduce that or get rid of it, I’d be very happy with."", 
""Are you asking in police departments or the U. S.?"", ""Mr. Bender: I meant systemic racism. In police departments, in hiring practices..."", ""Mr. Trump: Yeah, I’d like to think there is not but unfortunately, there probably is some. I would also say it’s very substantially less than it used to be."", ""Mr. Bender: How are you thinking about some of these issues? I know your position on law and orders is very clear. You’ve had some public events with the police. You had some victim’s families in here yesterday. But when it comes to..."", 
""Mr. Trump: By the way that was a very impactful moment. The people I met were incredible people."", ""Mr. Bender: Impactful in what way? What did you take away from that?"", ""Mr. Trump: Meeting the parents, in most cases, parents. of young people, sons in many of the cases, a daughter in one case, that were killed is devastating. To see the parents and so needless, I mean, it should never have happened. I met with a large number of parents that were just, I mean, their lives have been torn apart."", 
""Mr. Bender: Did any of those cases resonate with you? Any particular story that stands out?"", ""Mr. Trump: All of them."", ""Mr. Bender: Was there one that stood out?"", ""Mr. Trump: All of them. Ahmed. Ahmad. He is the young man who was running. It was just sad to see. The mother was a fantastic woman. Made a great impression. They all made a great impression on me. In fact, after that I had the speech with the law enforcement. So we had two meetings. And it was very interesting because they were very different meetings, very important meetings. But the impact of meeting the parents was very important."", 
""Mr. Bender: The meeting with families was private. And it sounds like everyone wanted to keep it that way, for a number of reasons. But when it comes to healing the country, is that something you think about and have you thought about ways to try to bring people back together?"", ""Mr. Trump: So I think, Michael, that the best way I can do it, it’s leadership. But I want to bring the economy back. Because if I can bring the economy back, African-American unemployment was the best it has ever been, by far. Number of jobs overall. Hispanic, Asian. But if I can bring the economy back, we’re gonna have great jobs, we’re gonna have families where life is going to be a lot easier. Their life is just going to be better. And I was there. We had the greatest economy. We had the largest increases and, you know, 3.2% increases, It’s unheard of what we did, and I think you would have seen a lot of people starting to come together. And now I’m starting that process all over again because Wuhan. I can give you 12, I can give you 15 different names for that. We can call it China. We can call it Wuhan. We can call it many different things. But because of the virus, it came from China, I have to start that process all over again."", 
""Mr. Bender: Is there any part of you that wishing you hadn’t sent the tweet about the shooting starts when the looting starts?"", ""Mr. Trump: Well, that tweet is viewed both ways. And by the way, that wasn’t from some mayor in Miami, there was a man named Frank Rizzo from New Jersey, was a rough guy. He ran a rough operation, but he didn’t have a lot of looting, I can tell you. But that is viewed both two ways. Number one, it can be viewed as a threat. And number two, it can be viewed as a fact that if people start looting, then end up getting shot. And that’s usually a fact. Now it’s less of a fact in a politically correct society. Because I saw a lot of looting and these kids would just walk out with television. Nobody was doing anything."", 
""Mr. Bender: Did you view it as a fact or a threat?"", ""Mr. Trump: I viewed it that, generally speaking, it could be a combination of both. And look, I think that it’s not right, that police offices run by weak liberal Democrats, allow kids to break into stores and walk out with television sets and put them in the back of a car. Which is incredible. Where does the car come from? But, you know, I saw tremendous looting. And I think it’s terrible. There was tremendous damage done. Small businesses were ruined. Lives were ruined by that and people were killed. Nobody mentions that. They don’t say, Well, what about the people that got killed on the other side? They’re more saying, Oh, what a horrible threat. But no, I view it to me, it would normally mean that when somebody walks into a store and walks out carrying a television set on his back, he’s putting himself in great danger, in theory. But then you look at a place like Seattle, where they take over a major part of a major city. And the mayor says, well, it’s going to be a love fest, and the governor does nothing and doesn’t even... says he doesn’t know about it, but on that he’s lying obviously because he knew about it. But he actually said, you saw that, he said, Gee, I didn’t know nothing about that. That’s a terrible thing. That’s a terrible precedent."", 
""Mr. Bender: You did move your rally off Juneteenth. Can you talk about why you did that?"", ""Mr. Trump: Well, I did that out of respect because I had two African-American friends and supporters. And most people, and I went to a lot of people, they didn’t they had not heard the term Juneteenth."", ""Mr. Bender: Do you know what it was?"", ""Mr. Trump: I did something good. I made it famous. I made Juneteenth very famous. It’s actually an important event, it’s an important time. But nobody had heard of it. Very few people have heard of it. Actually, a young African-American Secret Service agent knew what it was. I had political people who had no idea. Did you ever hear of Juneteenth before?"", 
""Ms. Farah: I did from last year when the White House put out a statement"", ""Mr. Trump: Oh really? We put out a statement? The Trump White House put out a statement?"", ""Ms. Farah: Yes"", ""Mr. Trump: Oh OK. Good. I don’t think it was put up by others. But we made people aware of it, and it’s good. But they asked me, you know, and these are two really good supporters, African-American supporters that they believe in what we’re saying…You know, we have a lot of black support, tremendous black support."", 
""Mr. Bender: Some people wondered why some of the black supporters didn’t walk over to St. John’s with you, or why they haven’t been to many events."", ""Mr. Trump: Because they weren’t here. I just made that decision very quickly. I’m the only man that can walk three blocks—in danger—can walk three blocks, hold up a Bible in front of a church that protesters just burned the hell out of and get bad publicity. I’m the only person that’s capable of doing that. Think of what I did. I made a speech which people thought was a good speech. I then walked across the street. Not across the street, I walked a long distance away. It’s like a three block walk. And there is danger, because of buildings. I’m not saying there is danger with the protesters, because the Secret Service had that in very good shape. We had no problem. But this danger from above right? I walked three blocks, go to a church that had just suffered a major fire that was built at the same time as the White House. So very important. John Adams was the first parishioner. Was he the fifth or sixth? Whatever. You’ll figure it out. First supporter. First parishioner. I hold up a Bible in front of the church that just got burned badly the night before, and I got bad publicity than me"", 
""Mr. Bender: There may be people who are critical of you no matter what. But why didn’t you pray? Why didn’t you read something from scripture? Why didn’t you bring someone from the black community? Or a parishioner?"", ""Mr. Trump: Well, I was standing outside on a sidewalk. It was very, very noisy, as you can imagine. The protesters, who, the day before tried to burn down the church…You know, everyone was saying, Oh, they were so wonderful. They weren’t wonderful. They tried to burn down the church. And it was, they told me, the same group. A similar group. So you have people screaming all over the place. And I didn’t think it was exactly the right time to pray. I’m on the sidewalk. And the church itself, I didn’t want to go in because they had a lot of insurance reasons. You know, the church was boarded up. The entire church was boarded up, and I knew that. So I went there, stood there, held up the Bible, talked to a few people and then we left. I came back and I got bad publicity."", 
""But I also, if you think about it, I went to West Point over the weekend, made a very good speech, according to everybody. They said the speech was one of the best. The kids thought it was one of the best they’d ever heard. Stood up there for a long time saluting. Were you there?"", ""Mr. Bender: No, but I watched. It looked like a really nice day."", ""Mr. Trump: Yeah. After the helicopters came over, the hats went up, the general said, Sir, Are you ready? I said, I’m ready. And he led me to a ramp that was long and steep and slippery. And I said, I got a problem because I wear, you know, the leather bottom shoes. I can show them to you if you like. Same pair. And you know what I mea, they’re slippery. I like them better than the rubber because they don’t catch. So they’re better for this. But they’re not good for ramps. I said, General, I got a problem here. That ramp is slippery.…"", 
""So I’m going to go real easy. So I did. And then the last 10 feet I ran down. They always stop it just before I ran, they always stop it. So, I spent three hours between speeches and saluting people and they end up, all they talked about is ramp. … If you would have seen this ramp, it was like an ice skating rink. So I’m the only one that can happen. But the church is an interesting thing. I mean, here I spent three hours on stage, the sun pouring in and I saluted 1,106 cadets, and that’s not easy. Even the general said, That’s amazing. Other presidents would never have been able to do it. Because usually they do the first 10. They do 10 honor rolls, and then they go home. I stayed there for hours. And what do I do? I get publicity about walking down a ramp. And does he have Parkinson’s? I don’t think so."", 
""Mr. Bender: Well, some of it may be your campaign raising similar questions about Biden’s age and people asking similar questions..."", ""Mr. Trump: Well, I’m four years younger. But no, it’s not Biden’s age. I know people that are much older than me. And they’re sharp as they were when they were 25. I know a man who’s 92, is 100% sharp. Take a look at\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Bernie Marcus,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Home Depot.\n\n\n      Take a look at\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Sheldon Adelson.\n\n\n\n      So sharp. It’s not the age. … But what the news does is they try and put me in that position they saw the ramp. The amazing thing is the Washington Post did a story. Do you have a copy of this story? It’s around someplace. Could you give me the copy of the Washington Post this guy wrote on the ramp? Do me a favor. He said Trump’s right. I could not believe it. Do you see the story that did a Trump’s right? It wasn’t his health it was politics. I said to the general, This isn’t good. Don’t forget the generals were in rubber, you know rubber boots."", 
""That was quick. Rampgate has nothing to do with Trump’s health. This was in the Washington Post. This was one of the great shockers of all time. Do you want it? You don’t need it, right?"", ""Mr. Bender: I can get it at home."", ""Mr. Trump: The writer, named Henry Olsen. I said, I can’t believe the Washington Post. I gained respect for The Washington Post. They said they had a picture. Look. This is steel. Steel."", ""Mr. Bender: Are you okay renaming some of the military bases with Confederate names?"", 
""Mr. Trump: So, I would like to keep. I don’t think we should be changing these bases. From these bases, we won two World Wars, and plenty of other things. We had great victories. They’re known all over the world. Fort Bragg is the largest military base in the world. I don’t think we should be changing the names and a lot of people agree. They were named after the Civil War in some cases in order to bring people together, north and south. And now you’re going to take them off? You’re going to bring people apart."", 
""Mr. Bender: Have you asked the two black friends you mentioned earlier about that? Or your Secret Service agents?"", ""Mr. Trump: No, I haven’t asked them about that. They told me about the Juneteenth. This is... you’re asking me a separate question."", ""Mr. Bender: Yes. I was wondering if you have members of the black community to run some of these questions by."", ""Mr. Trump: I haven’t discussed this with them. I just say this. We’ve won two World Wars. Those names were put on there for a reason. It was a reconciliation. It was bringing people together. This was after the war. And I think that we’re always trying to be so politically correct. And it’s hurting our country very badly in my opinion."", 
""Mr. Bender: The Buffalo protester, the 75-year-old man who fell. He had a brain injury and can’t walk. So you still think he may be Antifa?"", ""Mr. Trump: That I don’t know. I retweeted…he was a professional agitator. He was having a fight with other guys there that were agitators that were younger. Did you see the clip? Do you see the clip of the young guys that were screaming, Get the hell out of here? They were fighting with them. Then he steps and he puts himself right in the way of these people. And then he takes something and starts putting it on their body, touching them or close. And somebody said it was a scanner, whatever it was. I’m not saying anything one way or the other. I’m just saying, What did he stand right in their path? And he moved right into their path. And the soldiers knew him."", 
""Mr. Bender: Do you think he’s still you still think he might be Antifa?"", ""Mr. Trump: If you look at his tweets, he certainly had things about Antifa on his tweets. You saw that right? And he deleted his entire account when the people started going, because they saw the tweets, and then he deleted his entire account. So what’s that all about? No, I don’t like to see people hurt. But he put himself right into the midst of the soldiers. These police, they meant business. They were walking and he puts himself right there. And you could tell they knew him. They knew him. But he’s had a long history. Too bad he had to get hurt."", 
""Mr. Bender: You opened this on polls, let’s end it there. Sounds like there’s a big gap in Arizona. Iowa is tightening. How are you feeling about things right now?"", ""Mr. Trump: I hear we’re doing very well in the polls. And I see we’re doing very well. We have polls. And if you look at a lot of the polls, they’re very heavily weighted Democrat,"", ""But I hear we’re doing very well. We’ll see. We’ll get to know soon enough. This is no different than what I had in a certain other election in 2016. And they would tell me about the poll,"", 
""Mr. Bender: You see parallels with the two races?"", ""Mr. Trump: I think this is far worse. I think the press is more dishonest now than it was in 2016. They call them suppression polls. I think that I’m way ahead in Iowa. How could I not be ahead? I took care of the farmers better than anybody who’s ever taken care of farmers? Biden would never do it. He wouldn’t even know that they had a problem. How could they possibly go for Biden. He wouldn’t know the farmers even at a problem. They were targeted for $12 billion and $16 billion, and I got them $12 billion and $16 billion out of the tariffs that China was paying us and had a lot of money left over for the United States Treasury."", 
""Mr. Bender: I know you’re not happy about the press coverage. Sometimes it seems you want to run against the press more than you do against Biden."", ""Mr. Trump: I just think that I don’t think the press is extremely dishonest. The only thing I can’t figure out is why. Go back a couple of months and take a look at what we’ve done."", ""And then we would have started with the debt, and we would have started with cutting and you know, bringing things, really, I mean, we were in such great shape. And you think people would love having a strong military and low taxes and all of these things that we had. It was, you know, we have the strongest military now we’ve ever had. One of the things I did also, I don’t even know if it’s in here, the wall. Our border security now is as good as it’s ever been. But we just completed 212 miles of wall. And that’s one of the reasons—that’s a lot, you know, in the most critical areas. And nobody gets through that wall. That wall is the real deal. And so that’s a big thing. But we’ll see you again, Michael."", 
""Mr. Bender: Who do you think Biden should pick as his VP? I’ll leave you on that."", ""Mr. Trump: I mean, he said he’s going to pick a woman. So I would imagine he’s going to pick a woman. I would hope so. I don’t want to really guesstimate, but you know, there are probably three or four that I would see as being viable. More than that."", ""Mr. Bender: Thank you very much for the time."", ""Mr. Trump: Any time."", ""Copyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 87990cbe856818d5eddac44c7b1cdeb8"",

The  New York Times  and the Washington Post recently cited that study as evidence that the use of strict lockdowns to control the virus’s spread has been justified, and that current efforts to “open up” social and economic activity around the U.S. are dangerous and irresponsible. That is seriously misleading; the Chicago study is already out of date. More recent research supports the idea that the lockdowns should end."", 
""The Chicago study came out in early March and was the first truly rigorous economic analysis of the pandemic. It estimated that a three- to-four-month regime of mitigation, “combining home isolation of suspect cases, home quarantine of those living in the same household as suspect cases, and social distancing of the elderly and others at most risk of severe disease,” would save 1.76 million lives between March 1 and Oct. 1, resulting in benefits of $7.9 trillion, a number that far exceeds any conceivable cost of the mitigation strategy."", 
""They reached the $7.9 trillion figure by assuming that each life saved was worth $4.5 million on average. That number is an example of what economists call the value of a statistical life, or VSL. Used often by government agencies to evaluate proposals and projects, VSL is estimated by observing how much extra pay workers require to accept dangerous jobs."", ""But as the Chicago team carefully noted in their paper, “the particular benefits estimates are only as reliable . . . as projections on Covid-19’s spread and health risks.” Unfortunately, their analysis relied on projections for Covid-19 from Imperial College of London that by now have been shown to be full of analytical and even coding errors, and its estimates of Covid-19’s impact were too high—by more than an order of magnitude. Inevitably, this meant that the Chicago estimates were also way off."", 
""Fortunately, economists no longer have to rely on inherently flawed projections. We can use real data. In what might turn out to be the best paper on the economics of Covid-19, a team of economists from the University of California, Berkeley carefully evaluated empirical data on social distancing, shelter-in-place orders, and lives saved. To measure the impact of social distancing, they gathered data from cellphones on travel patterns, foot traffic in nonessential businesses, and personal interactions."",

Private employment on average fell by 7.8% between May 2019 and May 2020 in these states while plunging 13.2% in the others."",

Still, private job losses were higher in states that locked down like Colorado (9.5%) compared to economically similar ones that didn’t like Utah (4.6%)."", ""Yet per-capita Covid fatalities in states that stayed open were on average about 75% lower than those that locked down. One reason is that deaths in most states, regardless of whether they locked down, have been concentrated in nursing home facilities and minority communities that have higher rates of underlying health conditions and multigenerational housing."", 
""This is a main reason hospitalizations and deaths continued to surge in states like New York, New Jersey, Illinois and Massachusetts long after lockdowns took effect.

The causes of the flare-ups are varied. Some may spread among young people ignoring social-distancing advice. Border counties in Texas have been especially hard hit, perhaps from cross-border migration from hard-hit Mexico. Houston had 60,000 people at the\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      George Floyd\n\n\n\n      funeral and demonstration three weeks ago, and masks weren’t ubiquitous."", 
""The outbreaks are worrying, but the reopening was always going to require trial and error. Opening up bars to regular business may have been a mistake, and now Florida and Texas are shutting them down or limiting the number of patrons. The flare-ups should cause people to be more cautious, but they don’t justify the economic and public-health damage of strict new state-wide lockdowns."", ""As for chutzpah, the prize goes to\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo,\n\n\n\n      who reveled in the misery of others on Friday: “Oh, I say to them all, look at the numbers. You played politics with this virus and you lost. You told the people of your state and you told the people of this country, White House, ‘Don’t worry about it. Just open up, go about your business, this is all Democratic hyperbole.’ Oh, really? Now you see 27 states with the numbers going up. You see the death projections going up.”"", 
""To reinforce his thumb in the eye, Mr. Cuomo declared that travelers to New York from Utah, Arizona, Texas, Arkansas, Alabama, North Carolina, South Carolina and Florida will need to quarantine for 14 days. The order applies to states either with a positive-test rate over 10% or more than 10 in 100,000 residents testing positive per day over the last seven days. This will be difficult to enforce, but Mr. Cuomo said New York police may pull over cars with out-of-state licenses."", ""This comes with ill-grace from the man whose state still has by far the most virus infections and deaths. He’s also contradicting his own statements from earlier in the pandemic. When\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo\n\n\n\n      in March had police stop cars with New York license plates, Mr. Cuomo threatened to sue and tweeted, “We will not let New Yorkers be discriminated against.” Now he’s discriminating against other states, and notice that just one of his eight target states is run by a Democrat."", 
""Mr. Cuomo is responsible for the single worst public-policy mistake of this pandemic: His administration’s order requiring nursing homes to accept Covid-19 patients from hospitals. That bad judgment let the virus rampage through  institutions with the most vulnerable populations. Florida has some 4,000 homes for assisted senior living but locked down those facilities and it tests every worker at those institutions every two weeks."", ""None of the new state flare-ups come close to the severity of New York’s. New York state’s average positivity test rate exceeded 30% in late March and peaked above 50% in early April. Deaths are a lagging indicator, but New York had more than 900 fatalities a day at the peak. That’s more than as many daily deaths as there are in the entire U.S., with the exception of Friday when New Jersey reclassified some 1,854 deaths as probable from the virus."", 
""The Statista website, which tracks Covid deaths, reports that as of June 26 New Jersey (167) and New York (161) had far and away the most virus deaths in the country per 100,000 people. Arizona had 21, Florida only 15, and Texas eight."", ""Perhaps Mr. Cuomo is touting outbreaks elsewhere because he hopes they will help people forget his record. He ought to be thanking everyone, in Washington and other states, who helped New York in its hour of desperate need."", ""Copyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The virus uses the spike protein to latch onto human cells and gain entry."", ""Some vaccines under development contain something resembling the spike protein itself while others carry genetic code instructing the body’s own cells to make that protein."", ""By focusing on the spike protein, a vaccine could primarily generate enough “neutralizing” antibodies to block the virus, Dr. Graham said, and potentially avoid spawning too many other immune-system agents that may attach to other parts of the virus and are suspected in disease enhancement. He said this will have to be proven in studies."",

Two of the nation’s largest school districts—New York City and Fairfax, Va.—have said they will offer a mix of in-person and virtual learning in the fall, while the Los Angeles school district announced Monday it will have no in-person learning when school resumes next month."", 
""Many parents and teachers are concerned about the risks and restrictions associated with a return to in-school learning."", ""Health experts advise parents to look for certain safety measures, based on the most current understanding of how the virus spreads—primarily person-to-person, with higher risks in crowds and indoors. Among the most important: Children should wear masks, be grouped into small “pods” that don’t mix with others, and maintain physical distance. Schools should also beef up hygiene practices and cleaning."", 
""Other recommendations include outdoor instruction when possible, lunch in the classroom, and improving air ventilation and filtration in schools. Choir singing and wind instruments are more risky, they say. Recess and outdoor gym less so."", ""“It’s absolutely critical that we get kids back to school,” says\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Joseph Allen,\n\n\n\n      director of the Healthy Buildings Program at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, who adds that there are costs to children’s physical and social well-being with ongoing remote learning from home."", 
""Dr. Allen and his colleagues recently issued a 60-page report on risk-reduction strategies for schools."", ""Particularly important, he says, is minimizing the potential for airborne transmission of the virus by improved air filtration and ventilation in schools."", ""This can be done by increasing the amount of outdoor air coming into classrooms through something as simple as opening the windows and using fans. Schools with mechanical ventilation systems should use higher efficiency filters and ensure the system is using the maximum amount of outdoor air rather than just recirculating indoor air. Portable air purifiers in classrooms also help."", 
""The American Academy of Pediatrics issued recommendations last month for school reopening. Their guidelines say physical distancing between students can be 3 feet—rather than the standard 6-feet recommendation—particularly when face coverings are worn."", ""Nathaniel Beers,\n\n\n\n      a pediatrician at Children’s National Hospital in Washington, D.C., and a member of the committee that developed the guidelines, says the new distance recommendation was based largely on a June 1 Lancet study that suggests 3 feet between people is adequate."", 
""“If you’re saying 6 feet, there’s no way most school districts can meet that criteria and have more than 50% of their kids in a classroom,” says Dr. Beers."", ""The group recommends middle- and high-school students wear face coverings as much as possible. Dr. Beers said with younger children who touch their faces, and likely masks, more frequently, the value of wearing one may be diminished."", ""But other experts say universal mask-wearing is key to any school reopenings."", ""Dr. Allen says building in mask breaks may be helpful. “Mask fatigue is real,” he says. Good times for mask breaks could be during “quiet time” or reading time, when people aren’t talking—which can emit virus aerosols into the air."", 
""Face shields are also a good alternative for children who won’t wear masks, experts say."", ""Creating pods or distinct classes of children that stick together and don’t mix with the rest of the school population is another effective strategy, experts say, particularly in elementary schools. When a student tests positive for Covid-19, for example, only those in their classroom would need to get tested or quarantine."", ""“It makes control a lot easier,” says\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Ashleigh Tuite,\n\n\n\n      an assistant professor of epidemiology at Dalla Lana School of Public Health at the University of Toronto. “If you do have a case in a pod you can isolate students. You know who has been exposed.”"",

Meetings should be held remotely and lunch eaten separately to lower risk of any virus spread."", ""Experts say teachers should return to teaching in front of the classroom to create a buffer between them and students—as large as 15 to 20 feet. They should always wear masks or face shields when they need students to see their facial expressions."", 
""Most experts acknowledge the infrastructure isn’t there for regular, widespread testing of students. That likely won’t happen until there are affordable, rapid, saliva tests. But once available, regular testing of students and teachers is a good strategy, experts say."", ""Countries in Asia and Europe have opened largely with avoiding large outbreaks, but experts note in most other countries community transmission rates of Covid-19 were low when schools reopened, in contrast to many U.S. states now."", 
""The consensus is younger children are less likely to get Covid-19, and while there is also some evidence that they may pose a lower risk of transmission to adults, it isn’t conclusive.

They are also by far our best hope to stop the Covid-19 pandemic. Our other choices for stopping the disease are staying apart, which hammers our economy and society, or building “herd immunity” through natural infection, which would mean more than a million deaths in the U.S. and 10 million or more deaths world-wide. But the push for a Covid-19 vaccine faces three key hurdles."", 
""First, will it work? Preliminary studies indicate that several types of vaccine now in development produce a strong immune response. This is good news, but it doesn’t mean that the vaccine will protect people against infection or disease. We don’t know whether the immune response is protective, and if it is, how extensive that protection will be. (Protection ranges from 0% to 60% for influenza vaccines to 95% or higher for some other vaccines.) Even if a vaccine protects against disease, it may not prevent people from becoming infected and spreading the virus to others."", 
""Nor do we know whether all people will be protected by a new vaccine—particularly older people, who are at a markedly higher risk from Covid-19 and may be less likely to have a strong immune response. We also don’t know how long any protection will last. We don’t even know how protective natural Covid-19 infection is; for many vaccines, the extent of immunity to natural infection is the ceiling of their potential efficacy."", ""“\n        We don’t know whether all people will be protected by a new vaccine.\n        ”"", 
""Still, we have ample reason to be guardedly optimistic that some vaccines will provide some level of protection, and that this will be demonstrated before the end of 2020. Some vaccine candidates may be duds, and others’ efficacy may wane within just a few months—something that will, of course, take many months to know. Different vaccines may be more or less effective, and some vaccines may work less well for some groups. And most vaccines never make it to approval; many of today’s promising candidates may fail. We simply don’t know. That’s what studies are for."", 
""Second, will it be safe? What could go wrong with new vaccines? A lot. Several candidate vaccines use a harmless virus as a “vector” to deliver the antigen. This technology is promising, but we have limited experience using it. And we’ve never used DNA or RNA vaccines—the technology used for several Covid-19 vaccines in development—in humans."", ""We now know that a small proportion of children who contract Covid-19 get a potentially life-threatening inflammatory condition as their immune system reacts to the coronavirus. A vaccine could, in rare instances, create a similar immune storm that causes severe illness, particularly in children, either from the vaccine itself or from subsequent exposure to the virus. There is no particular reason to believe that Covid-19 vaccines will cause this type of overreaction, but it is a risk and must be studied, both before and after approval."", 
""Polio vaccination provides a cautionary tale. Soon after the vaccine was invented, one manufacturer contaminated a batch of vaccine, and many children became paralyzed. In 1976, when an outbreak of H1N1 influenza at Fort Dix, N.J., sparked concern about a pandemic, President\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Gerald Ford\n\n\n\n      led the effort to vaccinate tens of millions of Americans. But the feared pandemic never materialized, and the vaccine paralyzed more than 500 people, some of whom had lifelong problems as a result."", 
""Despite these rare and unfortunate episodes, vaccines are still strikingly safe: Billions of doses are given to people world-wide each year, with very few problems. Yet adverse events from vaccination may not be apparent until hundreds of thousands or millions of people have been vaccinated, so there can be no shortcuts on safety. Humility is in order."", ""Third, can we get it to people? Even if we can develop an effective vaccine with a reassuring initial safety record, will we be able to get it to people? Vaccine manufacturing isn’t simple. Failures or contamination can happen, even with experienced pharmaceutical companies—and not all the companies making the new vaccines are experienced."", 
""And even if an effective, apparently safe vaccine is produced in large quantities, it will be difficult to distribute it quickly and equitably, to store and ship it at the right temperature, to educate physicians and inform communities and to monitor uptake and possible harmful aftereffects. The protection provided by even a highly effective vaccine is only as good as our delivery systems. The measles vaccine is more than 90% effective, but the World Health Organization reports that more than 140,000 children died of the disease world-wide last year—most of them in communities with low vaccination rates."", 
""“\n        Particularly in this election season, the process of vaccine evaluation must be scientifically rigorous and open.\n        ”"", ""The biggest challenge to getting a Covid-19 vaccine into enough people’s arms won’t be scientific, technical or logistical; it will come from a lack of trust. Particularly in this election season, the process of vaccine evaluation must be scientifically rigorous and open. Public trust can be eroded by large profit margins for vaccine makers, a lack of transparency about the cost of production and prices that fail to take into account the fact that many vaccines benefit substantially from publicly funded research. Open meetings of the key advisory committees of the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will be indispensable."", 
""We must level with the American public in a way that hasn’t been done during this pandemic. We don’t have enough tests, so we need to prioritize. We don’t have enough protective equipment for health-care workers, so we should produce safely reusableN95 masks. And when vaccines do arrive, we won’t have enough for everyone. Different vaccines may become available at different times, and some will probably work better than others. Governments will need to set priorities among different groups, considering such factors as the risk of severe Covid-19 disease, protection of essential functions and fairness. Workers in jails, nursing homes and hospitals, for instance, and Black and Hispanic people are more likely to be exposed to the virus and to have underlying health conditions that make them particularly vulnerable."", 
""Moreover, vaccines won’t provide perfect protection and probably won’t completely end the pandemic. In our interconnected world, a truly global vaccination campaign will be essential to America’s long-term health and economic recovery."", """", ""Even within the U.S., unless the vaccine is extraordinarily effective and accepted, cases and clusters will continue, necessitating quick, effective public-health responses. Our society will still have to adapt to limit the virus’s spread—reducing close contact indoors, holding off on handshakes, wearing masks and improving ventilation. And unless the vaccine is surprisingly potent or we discover very effective treatments, my 91-year-old mother won’t be returning to her beloved choir practices soon."", 
""Deploying a Covid-19 vaccine is the most important thing we can do to restore some order and normalcy to our world. We can’t afford to get it wrong."", ""—Dr. Frieden was the director of the CDC from 2009 to 2017. He is the president and CEO of Resolve to Save Lives (an initiative of the public-health organization Vital Strategies) and a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations."", ""Will you want to receive a Covid-19 vaccine as soon as it’s available?

""The Fed has long resisted becoming the world’s backup lender. But it shed reservations after the pandemic went global. During two critical mid-March weeks, it bought a record $450 billion in Treasurys from investors desperate to raise dollars. By April, the Fed had lent another nearly half a trillion dollars to counterparts overseas, representing most of the emergency lending it had extended to fight the coronavirus at the time."", ""The massive commitment was among the Fed’s most significant—and least noticed—expansions of power yet. It eased a global dollar shortage, helped halt a deep market selloff and continues to support global markets today. It established the Fed as global guarantor of dollar funding, cementing the U.S. currency’s role as the global financial system’s underpinning."", 
""Just as the Fed expanded its role in the U.S. economy to an unprecedented degree during the 2008 financial maelstrom, it has in the coronavirus crisis expanded its power and influence globally."", ""“The Fed has vigorously embraced its role as a global lender of last resort in this episode,” said\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Nathan Sheets,\n\n\n\n      a former Fed economist who was the Treasury Department’s top international deputy from 2014 to 2017 and now is chief economist at investment-advisory firm PGIM Fixed Income. “When the chips were down, U.S. authorities acted.”"", 
""The value of the dollar has tumbled in recent weeks against other currencies as investors grow more troubled about the economic outlook and difficulty containing the coronavirus. Still, it is trading near levels recorded before the pandemic hit this year and above its long-term average on a trade-weighted basis, said\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Mark Sobel,\n\n\n\n      a former U.S. Treasury Department official now at the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum, a London-based think tank. Concerns that short-term declines in the dollar are an omen that its standing as the global reserve currency faces a threat are “vastly overdone,” he said."", 
""The Fed supplied most of the money abroad via “U.S. dollar liquidity swap lines.” In essence, it lends dollars for fixed periods to foreign central banks and in return takes in their local currencies at market exchange rates. At the loans’ end, the Fed swaps back the currencies at the original exchange rate and collects interest."", ""By stabilizing foreign dollar markets, the Fed’s actions likely avoided even greater disruptions to foreign economies and to global markets. Those disruptions could spill back to the U.S. economy, pushing the value of the dollar higher against other currencies and damping U.S. exports—and the economy."", 
""The risks to the Fed are minimal given that it is dealing with the most creditworthy nations and the most advanced central banks. But there are risks that investors come to expect a safety net for dollars that might lead to riskier borrowing during good times."", ""The Fed began deploying the swap facilities on March 15. By the end of March, it had expanded them to include 14 central banks while launching a separate program for those without swap lines to borrow dollars against their holdings of Treasurys. By May’s end, the total lent out under the programs peaked at $449 billion."", 
""The Fed’s goal is to keep financial markets functioning, and the March events had the makings of a global panic with a resulting rush for cash. The aim was to prevent investors from dumping Treasurys and other dollar-denominated assets such as U.S. stocks and corporate securities to raise cash, which would have driven prices of those assets even lower."", ""Fed Chairman Jerome Powell in a May 13 webcast acknowledged the Fed’s global role more explicitly than his predecessors had during the last global financial crisis. The loans let foreign central banks supply dollars cheaply to their banking systems and stopped everyone in that chain from panic-selling assets like U.S. Treasurys to raise cash, he said: “It had a very constructive effect on calming down those markets and reducing the safety premium for owning U.S. dollars.”"", 
""Andrew Hauser,\n\n\n\n      the Bank of England’s top markets official, in an early June speech said those swap lines “may be the most important part of the international financial stability safety net that few have ever heard of.”"", ""On July 29, the Fed said it would extend the temporary programs, originally scheduled to end in September, through March 2021. “The crisis and the economic fallout from the pandemic are far from over,” Mr. Powell said, “and we’ll leave them in place until we’re confident that they’re no longer needed.”"", 
""The shift has brought little of the scrutiny the Fed saw during the 2008-2009 crisis. When Mr. Powell appeared before Congress for hearings in June, lawmakers didn’t ask a single question about the huge sums the central bank made available to borrowers abroad."", ""The Fed’s governing charter from Congress gives it the authority to operate the swap lines, which it has done in some form since 1962, when the Fed heavily debated whether it had the authority to conduct foreign-exchange operations. Congress could revoke these authorities if it didn’t approve of how the Fed was using them."", 
""The swaps are structured so that the Fed’s foreign counterparts bear the risk of loans going bad or currency markets moving the wrong way. A large portion of the Fed’s overseas loans have recently been swapped back as markets around the world have recovered."", ""The Fed’s aggressive overseas lending has injected it into the world of foreign policy: Not every country gets equal access to the Fed’s dollars. Turkey, for example, has appealed unsuccessfully for dollar loans from the Fed to support its sinking currency, according to public comments made in April by the U.S. ambassador to Turkey,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      David Satterfield.\n\n\n\n      A representative for the Turkish central bank didn’t respond to a request for comment."", 
""Those decisions are based on creditworthiness, but political considerations could pose a threat to the Fed’s independence, said Mr. Sheets, the former Fed economist. When the Fed rolled out the lending program during the 2008 financial crisis, central-bank officials consulted with the leadership of the Treasury and State Department to make sure any operations were consistent with broader U.S. objectives, he said."", ""“The Fed was keenly aware of this tension that, yes, this was monetary policy, but it was abutting some broader issues that were not typically the Fed’s area,” said Mr. Sheets. Concerns that such lending programs could suck the Fed into broader foreign policy entanglements were a “meaningful constraint” on the expansion of the swap lines, he said."", 
""The moves have also left the world ever more tied to a single country’s economic management and central bank. Efforts have persisted for years to dilute the dollar’s central role, via the euro, then the Chinese yuan. But knowing the Fed is willing to step in has led banks, businesses and investors to flock to the U.S. currency."", ""This gives the U.S. enormous power—to punish foreign banks for violations of U.S. sanctions, for instance, or to consider options like breaking the Hong Kong dollar’s peg to the dollar, something U.S. officials considered earlier in July, The Wall Street Journal reported, to punish China for its treatment of the city, before shelving the idea."", 
""It also has produced a familiar cycle, said\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Stephen Jen,\n\n\n\n      chief executive of Eurizon SLJ Capital Ltd. in London and a longtime currency analyst and money manager. Investors value the dollar for its safety. But every time there is a major market stress there is a run to the currency, leading to breakdowns in the market, which forces the Fed to step in, which reinforces investors’ faith in the dollar, he said. “People have become more dependent on the dollar than any other currency,” he added."", 
""The Fed pioneered the current version of central-bank swap lines in 2007, when rising U.S. subprime-mortgage delinquencies jolted short-term debt markets and made it hard for big European banks to borrow dollars. Initially, the Fed lent to some European banks’ U.S. subsidiaries. It later rolled out swap lines to two foreign central banks, allowing the Fed to lend dollars with less risk, and expanded them to a dozen others over 2008 and 2009."", ""The Fed activated some of the swaps again in 2010 and 2011, as Eurozone debt problems mounted, and set up standing facilities with five major central banks in 2013. One Fed bank president formally objected, saying that the swaps effectively let European banks borrow at lower rates than U.S. banks and that they were an inappropriate incursion into fiscal policy."", 
""When coronavirus shutdowns hit the U.S. and Europe in March, oil prices plunged and stocks plummeted. Companies drew down bank credit lines, socking away dollars to pay workers and bills as revenue vanished. Financial markets showed alarming signs of dollar demand."", ""Should the U.S. Fed be the world’s lender of last resort during crises like the coronavirus pandemic? Join the conversation below."", ""March 16, among the worst days in recent market history, brought the financial system to the brink. Stock prices plunged globally as investors scrambled to raise cash. Banks sharply increased the cost of lending dollars to each other. Foreign banks were forced to pay dearly, gumming up the flow of dollars to their customers."", 
""In South Korea, big brokerages suddenly found themselves in need of large sums of dollars to meet margin calls, according to Tae Jong Ok, a Moody’s Investors Service analyst who covers financial institutions in the country. They had previously borrowed money to buy billions of dollars of derivatives tied to stocks in the U.S., Europe and Hong Kong. When those stocks plunged, lenders demanded they put up more cash. The scramble for dollars helped push the Korean won to its lowest level in a decade on March 19."", 
""Japanese banks suffered, too. Many had made loans directly to U.S. borrowers. The sector also owned more than $100 billion of collateralized loan obligations—bonds backed by bundles of loans to low-rated U.S. companies—that in some cases had been bought on short-term credit and needed to be regularly refinanced. Insurers in Japan that had invested heavily in higher-yielding assets abroad also had difficulty securing dollars to fund their trades."", ""In Singapore, high borrowing costs affected the dollar supply to companies needing to pay off debt or import and export goods, according to bankers in the city-state. “There was a classic ‘dash for cash’ scenario,” said a representative of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, adding that dollar-market conditions became so strained there was indiscriminate asset-selling."", 
""Central bankers from Singapore, South Korea, Australia and elsewhere swapped tales of the carnage on a regular call that included a representative of the Fed, according to people familiar with the calls."", ""As the crisis snowballed, the Fed increased purchases of Treasurys from $40 billion a day on March 16 to a record $75 billion days later. It also expanded the dollar swap lines to nine other countries. By March 31, the Fed had launched a new program that let some 170 central banks borrow dollars against their holdings of U.S. Treasurys."",

""This was a serious complication. Some public-health authorities feared the virus might be spreading in the U.S. Mr. Azar asked if the CDC could go faster."", ""“You’ve got to do this,” he told the CDC official, said the attendee."", ""It took 21 days for testing to take off—from Feb. 8 when state and city public-health labs detected a problem, until Feb. 29, when federal officials offered a broad solution."", ""The lost days stemmed in part from missteps by U.S. health leaders. They dismissed other solutions that could have led to national testing, underestimated the risk of the virus spreading and were overly confident they could fix the problem, according to interviews with people familiar with the testing crisis, previously undisclosed emails and other correspondence reviewed by The Wall Street Journal."", 
""There were already more than 50 mostly hidden infections a day in the U.S. by mid-February, suggesting that community transmission probably began in January, according to estimates from Northeastern University."", ""During the 21-day delay, the virus continued to move undetected, on the way to making the U.S. the world leader in coronavirus cases. More than 5.4 million Americans have been infected and more than 170,500 have died as of Tuesday morning, data compiled by Johns Hopkins University show."", 
""The delay set back testing, a critical tool to control the spread of a virus. The lack of adequate testing meant public-health officials couldn’t identify and isolate infected individuals and track down people they exposed to the virus.

""A comparison with South Korea is instructive. Both governments authorized their first Covid-19 tests Feb. 4. Within three days, a South Korean company was distributing tests—around the time the CDC started shipping kits to states—and several South Korean suppliers soon followed. By the time the U.S. figured out how to handle its testing snag, South Korea had completed more than 58,000 tests, and the country’s response is widely considered a success, though there has been a recent uptick in cases."", 
""Officials at the HHS, which includes the Food and Drug Administration and CDC, disagree that testing delays worsened the pandemic. “While developing this first test is paramount to any pandemic response, the CDC and our public-health labs were not intended to bear the weight or capacity of nationwide testing on this scale,” said HHS spokesman \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Michael Caputo."", ""“This administration built a comprehensive diagnostic testing system from scratch,” he said, and “now has the world’s most robust public-private testing system and is better prepared to respond to future global health threats.” The HHS said Mr. Azar wanted the testing delay to be fixed immediately.

But in the third component, the negative control was somehow turning up positive."", 
""Dr. Vetter soon heard grumblings from other public-health labs showing they weren’t alone. That “gave us a little bit of comfort, because at least we knew it wasn’t just us,” she said. “But then we were left with this horrible feeling of ‘what do we do?’ ”"", ""When New York state’s health department received the test that Saturday, it found problems with the first and third parts of the test. The testing-chemical mixture was contaminated, New York state health officials said later."",

This makes the test invalid. This is being seen at multiple labs.” A spokesman for Dr. Rakeman-Cagno didn’t respond to requests for comment."", ""Scott Becker,\n\n\n\n       chief executive of the Association of Public Health Laboratories, a nonprofit that represents state and local governmental health labs, on Sunday morning, Feb. 9, saw his phone light up with emails from lab directors saying the tests weren’t working right."", 
""“This really can’t be happening,” Mr. Becker said he thought. “Our only tool was testing. And otherwise we are flying blind.”"", ""The FDA learned Feb. 10 that 10% of the public-health labs found problems with the third test component’s accuracy, said agency officials."", ""The Wall Street Journal is examining the causes of the coronavirus catastrophe and the bungled response that followed."", ""Taken by surprise, the CDC set out to remake the third component, a process that would take a week or more. The agency was confident it could fix the test, which worked in its own labs. On Feb. 11, the public-lab association told its members the CDC was remanufacturing the third component to ship out as a replacement."", 
""Some labs that didn’t encounter the problem started testing patients. Most went on pause."", ""Mr. Azar in a speech that day praised the tests, saying, “these test kits are now available for order by U.S. state and local public-health laboratories, Defense Department laboratories, and select international laboratories.”"", ""CDC officials told public-health lab representatives that the new component would be available the following week, according to a Feb. 12 written summary of a call between those parties."", 
""By Feb. 16, the FDA learned that 26 public-health labs out of 100 had found problems, said FDA officials."", ""Mr. Azar wanted a fast solution, said people familiar with the discussions.

""What should U.S. health agencies have done differently to make coronavirus testing available sooner? Join the conversation below."", ""Mr. Azar asked, “Well, how important is it?” and Dr. Jernigan responded that the sequence was essential, the attendee said."", ""That’s when Mr. Azar asked if the CDC could move more quickly."", ""Dr. Jernigan didn’t respond to requests for comment."", ""The CDC’s Dr. Redfield told Mr. Azar the agency was working on a fix, said people familiar with the discussions. Over the following days, Dr. Redfield assured him they could remake the faulty third component, they said."", 
""Mr. Azar initially didn’t think a short testing delay would be a problem because he believed the risk of spread was low, but he was frustrated and urged a fix, people familiar with the discussions said."", ""Dr. Redfield kept changing the timeline of when the test could be fixed, people familiar with the discussions said, pushing it later and later. Mr. Azar was told on Feb. 18 the test might not be ready until March 12, they said."", ""On Feb. 19, knowing that some labs had also had problems with the first component of the test, the CDC told public-health labs it would replace all the test chemicals and send out new kits, according to a written summary of a call between the CDC and public-health labs. The CDC now said it couldn’t say when the new kits would be ready."", 
""By then, lab specialists at the agency had tried at least two ways to manufacture a new third component, according to a federal official. But they couldn’t get it to work. That suggested that contamination might not be the problem. Inside the agency’s labs, the mood shifted from confidence to feeling under pressure."", ""Meanwhile, the virus was spreading. Two people died at home on Feb. 6 and Feb. 17 in Santa Clara County, Calif. In April, autopsies determined they were Covid-19 positive. Neither had any travel history."", 
""About a million people gathered in New Orleans for Mardi Gras, which fell on Feb. 25. Attendees infected there seeded cases in other states, CDC reports in April and May found."", ""Given continued problems with the third component, officials worked on other options. CDC scientists scrambled to analyze test data using just the first two components. On Feb. 21, it looked that one solution worked; three days later, it didn’t, said FDA officials."", ""Timothy Stenzel,\n\n\n\n       the FDA official in charge of lab diagnostics, flew to the CDC’s Respiratory Virus Diagnostic Lab in Atlanta, where the test was developed, on Feb. 22."", 
""What he saw there was alarming, his boss \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Jeffrey Shuren,\n\n\n\n       the FDA’s medical-device center director, said in a later HHS conference call recounted by a senior administration official. In the call, Dr. Shuren described the lab as “filthy”—meaning it had the potential to contaminate—the official said. If it had been any other lab, Dr. Shuren told CDC officials on the call, the FDA would have shut it down, the official said. FDA spokeswoman \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Stephanie Caccomo\n\n\n\n       declined to comment on the conference call."", 
""Dr. Stenzel concluded the test’s design was probably adequate but something had gone wrong in the manufacture of its early version, FDA officials said. He didn’t determine exactly what had gone wrong, they said."", ""A later test made by commercial lab company \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Laboratory Corp. of America\n\n\n       used the same CDC design and didn’t have the same accuracy problems, the FDA officials said. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            LabCorp\n\n\n       developed its test with published information about the CDC’s design and adapted it to work with different chemicals and on high-throughput instruments, said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Pattie Kushner,\n\n\n\n       LabCorp’s chief communications officer. The test is highly accurate, she said."", 
""The CDC said in an article in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases that its test performed adequately in its own labs in January and February on nearly 3,000 specimens."", ""Alarm about the virus and testing woes hit a crescendo in late February. Mr. Becker and \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Grace Kubin\n\n\n\n      —a lab director at the Texas Department of State Health Services and then-president of the public-lab association—wrote FDA Commissioner \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Stephen Hahn\n\n\n\n       a Feb. 24 letter pleading with the commissioner to let public-health labs bypass the authorization process and design and implement their own tests."", 
""“We are now many weeks into the response,” they wrote, “with still no diagnostic or surveillance test available outside of CDC for the vast majority of our member laboratories.”"", ""A turning point came Feb. 25, when \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Nancy Messonnier,\n\n\n\n       the CDC’s top respiratory-diseases official, said in a press call that community spread of the virus was a question of when, not if, and that disruption to everyday life could be severe. The stock market cratered."", 
""A furious President Trump called Mr. Azar and considered having Dr. Messonnier fired, said people familiar with the discussion. Mr. Trump announced Vice President \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Mike Pence\n\n\n\n       would assume primary control of the task force. The White House declined to comment."", ""On Feb. 26—18 days after the problem first emerged—public-health labs began hearing the FDA was likely to let them use some version of the original test after all."", ""The subject line of an email that day from Dr. Stenzel to the public-lab association read: “Do not destroy your current CDC 2019 nCoV Coronavirus EUA Kits,” and “Please hold for additional follow on information.”"", 
""“Here we go again! I hope we have not destroyed the earlier kit,” \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Sandip Shah,\n\n\n\n       director of Michigan’s state public-health lab, wrote to his staff, forwarding the email."", ""A microbiologist responded: “We have not destroyed the kit!”"", ""Another lab member, quoting from the baseball movie “The Sandlot,” in which a boy is exasperated his friend \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Scotty Smalls\n\n\n\n       didn’t have essential childhood skills, emailed: “you are killing me Smalls.”"", 
""That day, the FDA gave the go-ahead for the abbreviated test—dropping the third component—after determining it could work."", ""The HHS initiated a conference call with some members of the task force and Brian Harrison, Mr. Azar’s chief of staff, said a person familiar with the discussion. Mr. Harrison urged them to get the remade CDC tests out quickly, the person said."", ""The public-health labs still would have to submit for and get FDA emergency-use authorization for new tests of their own creation. But they could do so in a single application. Public-health labs wanting to use the CDC kit could eliminate the third component and get started immediately."", 
""“From the beginning of the Covid-19 response, Secretary Azar and Brian Harrison insisted that accurate testing be widely proliferated as quickly as possible,” an HHS spokeswoman said on Mr. Harrison’s behalf."", ""On a Feb. 26 call with the CDC, FDA and other public-health labs to go over the solution, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Jill Taylor,\n\n\n\n       director of New York’s Wadsworth Center, the state’s research and public-health laboratory, expressed frustration at not having a usable test. New York was among a small number of labs that would still have to wait for a new CDC test because it had not been able to get the first component to work."", 
""“This is completely unacceptable,” Dr. Taylor said, according to a person on the call. “We need to do something.”"", ""She told the FDA that Wadsworth had developed its own test. The FDA promised to expedite a review New York state submitted on behalf of the state and New York City. The FDA confirmed the account, and a state health-department spokesman said Dr. Taylor verified the account."", ""Wadsworth officials had made their test because they worried it could take a long time to fix the CDC test and that materials would be in short supply, said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Gareth Rhodes,\n\n\n\n       a state official on New York’s coronavirus task force in charge of testing."", 
""At the time, some federal officials continued to dismiss the severity of the crisis. Mr. Trump in a Feb. 26 press conference said that spread of the virus in the U.S. wasn’t inevitable and that “the risk to the American public remains very low.”"", ""On Feb. 27, the CDC’s contractor produced the two-component test and shipped it to seven public-health labs for validation, to make sure it worked. Once it did, tests went out to 40 more public-health labs on Feb. 28."", ""On Feb. 29, FDA officials let hundreds of academic hospital labs know they could use their own tests and said the agency would give them retroactive proof of accuracy.

One lender offered the highly qualified borrower a 3.25% rate, another a 5% rate. Neither loan required paying points, Mr. Bird said."", ""It is happening because important components of the jumbo marketplace—the correspondent and securitization channels—have gone nearly dormant during this crisis. The correspondent channel refers to banks, such as major player Wells Fargo, that used to purchase many jumbo loans originated by other lenders to hold them in their portfolios. Securitization refers to investors who buy up bundles of jumbo loans from the originating lenders; these private investors are required in this marketplace because government-sponsored entities such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac don’t buy jumbo loans. Both of these avenues to selling off a jumbo loan have dwindled in the Covid era, leaving most jumbo-loan originators owning the loans they approve and initially fund."",

""Alberto Cervantes, Daniela Hernandez/THE WALL STREET JOURNAL"", ""“What we think about health information is changing dramatically,” says Kirk Nahra, a privacy and data security attorney who represents health-care companies."", ""One concern is the proliferation of health and wellness consumer technologies. Internet-enabled devices and apps tracking our steps, monitoring our heart rates and oxygen levels, and sensing our emotions are generating masses of granular information about the mental and physical conditions of their users."", 
""Health researchers see a future of smart homes constructed with mirrors that can detect skin abnormalities and heart conditions, floors that can sense dizziness and unsteady gait, mattresses that check vital signs and toilet seats that measure blood pressure."", ""Such sensitive bodily monitoring may not be subject to HIPAA’s consent and disclosure requirements if the companies making the devices and analyzing the data operate outside the health-care system. The data gleaned from the technology could still be subject to other federal or state data regulations or a manufacturer’s own privacy policy."", 
""Some health law observers say our everyday digital routines pose an even trickier issue for medical confidentiality."", ""A look at what’s next for health"", ""The world’s largest tech companies, including \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Alphabet Inc.’s\n\n\n       Google, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Microsoft Corp.\n\n\n       and \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Amazon.com Inc.,\n\n\n       are already plunging into the health-care space. Google, for example, is developing a search portal that doctors and nurses can use to diagnose diseases, and has agreements with some hospital systems and providers that permit the company to access tens of millions of personally identifiable health records with little or no input from patients. The huge data sets are helping to train machine-learning algorithms to recognize patterns in the clinical data. Smarter artificial intelligence could help physicians better identify and even predict medical conditions. Google has said its intentions in health are unconnected with its advertising business, but the prospect of tech giants’ collecting troves of health records has raised concerns among lawmakers, patients and doctors, who fear the data could be used in unexpected ways."", 
""Data mining could also expand the ability to infer health conditions from behavior and online activities that don’t obviously have any medical connection."", ""Dr. Mason Marks, a health law professor at Gonzaga University, labels these inferences “emergent medical data.” It consists of millions of “digital traces” harvested from social media accounts and devices like wearables that are plugged into algorithms to predict conditions like suicidal depression or alcoholism. Already, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Facebook\n\n\n      deploys an AI system programmed to identify potential suicidal language."", 
""Do you see benefits to letting go of some privacy around health-care information? Join the conversation below."", ""Data mining has the potential to improve health screening, facilitate medical research and better our understanding of diseases."", ""But “emergent medical data” is largely unregulated, Dr. Marks says, and could also be used for consumer profiling and marketing purposes and to discriminate against people flagged by the algorithms. He says he favors a privacy law that treats such health inferences the same as traditional medical data."", 
""“Companies and governments shouldn’t be able to collect health information out of thin air,” he says."", ""Public sentiment could also shape health privacy laws. The U.S. legal system has long viewed health care as a domain requiring exceptional privacy protections, says Nicolas Terry, executive director of the Hall Center for Law and Health at Indiana University. The Covid-19 crisis could help give rise to a “solidarity-based health care” that puts less emphasis on individual privacy rights and more on public health. Personal health information would become less proprietary and treated more like “society’s data,” gathered for the wellbeing of the whole herd, Prof. Terry says. Such a shift could loosen privacy regulations around medical research and give scientists freer access to personal health information."", 
""Concerns about HIPAA could also be addressed by putting in place broader antidiscrimination protections, making it unlawful to use the information to deny access to housing, employment or for targeted advertising."", ""Another approach is to give consumers more control over what kinds of data can be collected and how it is used."", ""“For example, the users of social media platforms could be presented with a menu of options that include predictions about self-harm, substance abuse, mental health conditions and physical health conditions,” wrote Dr. Marks in a recent paper. Users could have the option of participating in different health surveillance programs or decide whether they want their information used for other purposes like targeted advertising."", 
""Facebook users, he wrote, could be asked to opt in to suicide screening and choose whether to notify friends or family, or dispatch first responders to the home if a suicide risk is detected from their online activity."", ""“HIPAA worked fairly well back when it was written, when medical records were stored in paper charts,” says Dr. Marks. “But today, in the Information Age, we need something new.”"", ""Write to Jacob Gershman at jacob.gershman@wsj.com"", ""Copyright ©2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

While Mr. Biden has criticized the Trump trade war as self-destructive, the campaign has refused to pledge removing the levies, saying only they would be re-evaluated.

""They also criticize the way that President Trump has gone about confronting China. “The application of his strategy to negotiate and contend with them has just been a mess,” said Mr. Campbell."", ""The Trump team argues that Mr. Biden represents the longtime establishment that encouraged China’s rise in the first place, including fostering a global free-trade system that many Americans now blame for hurting U.S. factory jobs. In 2000, as one of the most influential lawmakers on international policy, Mr. Biden used his clout to back \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Bill Clinton’s\n\n\n\n       deal letting China into the World Trade Organization."", 
""Should the U.S. continue taking a harder line on China? Join the conversation below."", ""“\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Donald Trump\n      \n\n\n\n       has been fearless in…cleaning up the mess made by career politicians like Biden,” said Michigan Republican Rep. Jack Bergman during a Trump campaign call Wednesday on the escalating China debate. He said Mr. Biden, despite his new rhetoric, can’t break from the old mind-set."", ""A more bare-knuckled China policy also would represent a notable shift for Mr. Biden and his foreign-policy team. Most of them served in the Obama administration, which some say in retrospect was too soft on China and too slow to recognize President \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Xi Jinping’s\n\n\n\n       nationalist and authoritarian bent."", 
""Mr. Biden says he would work more closely than Mr. Trump has to rally allies in a coordinated global campaign to pressure Beijing. He says Mr. Trump’s efforts would be far more effective if he worked with other countries, rather than simultaneously engaging in trade fights with Europe, Canada, Mexico, South Korea and Japan."", ""“We make up 25% of the world’s economy but we poked our finger in the eyes of all of our allies out there,” Mr. Biden said recently. “The way China will respond is when we gather the rest of the world.”"", 
""Mr. Biden also says he would place a higher emphasis than Mr. Trump on cooperating with China on global challenges he considers as vital to American interests as confronting Beijing."", ""Where Mr. Trump has this year tried to isolate China over the pandemic—and the World Health Organization over its ties to China—Mr. Biden would likely take a more global approach to containing the virus. Where Mr. Trump plays down concerns over climate change, Mr. Biden calls it “an existential threat.” Mr. Biden can’t address his climate agenda without help from China, the world’s largest carbon emitter."", 
""That could complicate any attempts to strike a harder line against Beijing. “Should there be an easing up of competition if there’s a prospect of cooperation? What if China links those two?” asks \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Thomas Wright,\n\n\n\n       a foreign-policy fellow at the Brookings Institution."", ""The candidates’ contrasting diplomatic approaches reflect their clashing governing philosophies."", ""Mr. Biden spent much of his four decades in government working with world leaders to help shape the modern American-led global order. Mr. Trump’s late-life entry into politics was animated by his opposition to that order. He has at times questioned the value of longtime military and trade relations with Japan and South Korea, two American allies in China’s orbit."", 
""For more than four decades, presidents from both parties, joined by executives of multinational corporations, sought to encourage China’s integration with the U.S. and the world. They argued that would benefit the U.S. and would lead to greater openness as Beijing followed global rules."", ""President Obama began his term seeking closer ties with Beijing and asked his vice president to develop a relationship with Mr. Xi. Mr. Biden boasts about having spent more time with the Chinese leader than any other foreign official, saying the two had 25 hours of private meals and logged 24,000 miles of travel together."", 
""“It is in our self-interest that China continue to prosper,” Mr. Biden said during a 2011 visit to the country, a quote cited often by the Trump campaign. Biden supporters say Mr. Trump has made similar comments as president."", ""The Obama-Biden administration’s early views on China had been based on assumptions that Mr. Xi would continue the market-liberalizing policies of his predecessors. As the Chinese leader consolidated power and reversed many of those measures, officials say, their views on China changed."", 
""Biden aides say he observed firsthand the increasingly autocratic tendencies of Mr. Xi and other Chinese leaders. In a 2013 meeting, aides say, he told Mr. Xi the U.S. would ignore Beijing’s attempt to expand its air defense zone, and would back allies doing the same. Some critics at the time said Mr. Biden should have publicly demanded China remove the zone, which he didn’t do on that trip."", ""Near the end of Mr. Obama’s term, the U.S. began to crack down on cyber-theft, challenged Chinese territorial claims in the South China Sea and tightened scrutiny of Chinese investment in U.S. technology. Mr. Biden took the lead in criticizing Chinese trade practices—though the administration’s actions consisted mainly of filing complaints with the World Trade Organization in Geneva."", 
""President Trump accelerated the turn against China. He blasted the WTO as too slow and weak, and launched a trade war that imposed tariffs on $370 billion of Chinese imports. He has curbed Chinese tech companies including Huawei Technologies Co. and ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok."", ""The pressure campaign expanded in the Covid-19 pandemic, which Mr. Trump blames on China. The U.S. has closed the Chinese consulate in Houston for alleged economic espionage, ramped up military exercises in the South China Sea and imposed sanctions on senior Chinese officials."", 
""In the six months since Mr. Biden effectively sealed the Democratic nomination, the incumbent and challenger have traded barbs on China. Each campaign has produced video ads featuring footage of the opposing candidate meeting with Mr. Xi. “Biden stands up for China,” the Trump ad says. “Trump rolled over for the Chinese,” counters the Biden spot."", ""The new Washington consensus no longer sees China on a path to adopting Western political and economic systems, but rather as an authoritarian rival. The hostility isn’t just over trade, but also stems from the crackdown in Hong Kong and repression of Uighur Muslims."", 
""“Regardless of who wins, U.S. policy toward China is going to be tougher over the next five years than the last five years,” says \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Richard Haass,\n\n\n\n       a State Department official in the George W. Bush administration, now president of the Council on Foreign Relations. “China has changed, and U.S. thinking on China has changed.”"", ""Lawmakers have introduced more than 200 bills addressing China in the current congressional session, double the number in the previous one. In a summer Pew Research Center poll, 73% of Americans said they had an unfavorable view of China, just 22% a favorable one. In 2011, 51% had a positive view, 36% a negative one."", 
""“The Chinese people…feel very disappointed about what is happening in this country towards China, there’s a rising anger among the Chinese public,” \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Cui Tiankai,\n\n\n\n       China’s ambassador to the U.S., told the annual Aspen Security Forum last month. He said leaders need to “not allow any miscalculation or misperceptions to hijack the relations.”"", ""One Biden critique of the Trump China policy is that it has inflicted economic damage on the U.S. without triggering the Chinese economic reforms Mr. Trump has demanded. The fallout to the U.S. has included a plunge in agricultural exports, as well as higher costs and supply disruptions for U.S. companies dependent on Chinese imports."", 
""A Moody’s Analytics study late last year estimated the China trade war cost the U.S. economy about 300,000 jobs and shaved 0.3% off U.S. gross domestic product."", ""Trump officials say much of the lost sales will ultimately be made up with China purchase pledges made in a January trade agreement."", ""Biden advisers see China policy as just as much about rebuilding the U.S. economy as containing China’s. “The debate should be about who’s going to make America more competitive,” says Ely Ratner, a Biden national security aide in the Obama administration now at the Center for a New American Security."", 
""America policy makers have long tried to coax Beijing to move toward American-style capitalism. If elected, Mr. Biden’s plans to bolster growth include a nod to Chinese-style state intervention. He has an ambitious “Buy American” proposal that would earmark more federal funds for U.S. companies."", ""Mr. Biden says his China policy would include a heavy emphasis on promoting democracy and human rights. He sees this as enabling the U.S. to compete with Beijing globally on values, not just commerce, a traditional American foreign-policy framework that Mr. Trump has played down."", 
""That would also inform Mr. Biden’s technology policies. “As the vice president sees it, there’s a division in the world between techno-democracies and techno-autocracies,” said Antony Blinken, the campaign’s senior foreign-policy adviser. The democracies see technology as a tool for fostering greater freedom, the autocracies sell dictators enhanced surveillance and censorship tools."", ""A President Biden would have to manage divisions among Democrats over how to confront China. One battle within the party is over the military. One side wants big Pentagon budget cuts and the other hopes for more military support for Asian allies."", 
""Another fight looms over trade. Many Democrats oppose new free-trade agreements. Others say those pacts are vital to bolstering alliances to counter China."", ""At the end of his term, Mr. Obama negotiated the 12-nation Trans Pacific Partnership with that goal in mind. At the time, Mr. Biden supported it. Mr. Trump ran against TPP in his 2016 campaign and pulled the U.S. out. Now the Biden campaign says rejoining the bloc isn’t a top priority."", ""Write to Jacob M. Schlesinger at jacob.schlesinger@wsj.com"",

Like their near cousins, stoops, steps, even fire escapes, porches offer a semipublic setting where we can meet friends and neighbors face-to-face—even if those faces are masked. In the words of Claude Stephens, founder of a tongue-in-cheek group called Professional Porch Sitters Union Local 1339, a porch is “the only place where you can feel like you are outside and inside at the same time; out with all of the neighbors and alone reading a book.”"", 
""In Europe there are town squares and sidewalk cafes for fostering casual encounters, but there is something distinctly American about the front porch. Starting in the 19th century, every respectable house in the U.S. was built with a confident front porch. In an era when the backyard was devoted to drudgery—vegetable gardens, trash pits, outhouses, perhaps a chicken or goat—the porch offered an oasis of calm."", ""“The front porch was an escape from the heat of the wood-burning kitchen stove,” explains historian Donald Empson, the author of “The Street Where You Live,” an architectural guide to St. Paul, Minn. “On the porch, in the cool of the evening, the family could gather to discuss the day’s events and exchange the latest news with neighbors strolling by.” Porches offered neighbors a place to exchange gossip, to spin sagas and sing songs, to flirt and court and air political views. The front porch at the turn of the century was  Starbucks ,  flash mob, church social and  Facebook  rolled into one."", 
""That started to change in the 1920s with the emergence of the automobile. A car meant that you were no longer tethered to the community in which you lived. You could drive to the beach or a friend’s house to relax instead of seesawing on a porch swing. Enclosed in a metal cocoon, you could speed past people whom you would have stopped to interact with if you’d been on foot."", ""Modern ranch houses, split-levels and “little boxes made of ticky tacky,” as the folk singer Pete Seeger called them, had no time or space for front porches. In Levittown, the Long Island housing development that served as a role model for the post-World War II suburbs, almost none of the 2,000-plus houses came with a front porch."",

That is creating a powerful boost that, while temporary in nature, investors shouldn’t ignore."", ""The sapping of demand that hit during the first half of the year dealt a heavy blow to the economy, but what happened to inventories only made it worse. In the earlier stages of the pandemic, disruptions to global supply chains emanating from China led to shortages of the parts and materials manufacturers needed. Then, as Covid-19 gripped the U.S., factories and their suppliers sharply curtailed, and in many cases halted, production, further reducing inventories. Finally, as they were able to come back on line, many were leery of ramping up production, worrying that any rebound in demand as the economy reopened might be meager."", 
""When inventories get run down, gross domestic product gets depressed. That is because demand is being met by what is already on businesses’ shelves rather than new production. In the first quarter, when GDP fell at a 5% annual rate, 1.3 percentage points of the decline were due to falling inventories. In the second quarter, when GDP fell 31.7%, falling inventories accounted for 3.5 percentage points of the decline."", ""But when businesses stop drawing down inventories, more production is needed to meet demand. If inventory levels are flat in the third quarter from the second, for example, GDP growth will be boosted by around 6 percentage points."", 
""The inventory effect in the third quarter may not be as large as that for the simple reason that maintaining inventory levels while meeting an unexpected pickup demand is hard. But if businesses merely draw down inventories at a slower pace in the third quarter, manufacturers will need to produce more, adding to GDP. That could set off what is known as the “bullwhip effect,” in which efforts to restock while meeting increased demand travel through supply chains, affecting finished-goods manufacturers, makers of parts and components and raw-materials suppliers."",

People infected with Covid-19 can stop isolating after 10 days have passed since the onset of symptoms, as long as they haven’t had a fever in 24 hours and their other symptoms are improving, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. For severe cases, the CDC says a person can be contagious for up to 20 days."", 
""Mr. Trump was given a steroid, dexamethasone, typically recommended for severe cases of Covid-19, in addition to a five-day course of the antiviral drug remdesivir and an experimental antibody drug cocktail, the president’s doctor, Sean Conley, has said. Dr. Conley said Monday it was possible Mr. Trump would no longer be contagious before the 10-day period ends."", ""On Tuesday, Dr. Conley said in a memo that Mr. Trump was symptom-free and his vital signs remained stable."", ""Trump campaign spokesman\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Tim Murtaugh,\n\n\n\n      asked whether the president’s participation in the debate was contingent on him testing negative before then, said the campaign would rely on Mr. Trump’s medical team. The Commission on Presidential Debates didn’t respond to a question on whether it would require Mr. Trump to test negative before participating."", 
""The Trump team has suggested the Miami debate be held outside, according to a person briefed on the discussions. Asked for comment, Mr. Murtaugh said, “Everyone agrees that an outdoor event would be the safest possible environment.”"", ""Mr. Biden said Tuesday night that he was looking forward to debating the president, provided all safety protocols are followed.

The White House didn’t respond to a request for comment on the Twitter and Facebook moves."", ""Medical experts say the risk from the virus is very real, especially for older people and people with pre-existing health problems. Researchers estimate Covid-19 is about six times as deadly as the seasonal flu and can also cause long-term health problems, such as lung damage. There is a seasonal vaccine for the flu, which is partly effective, while Covid-19 vaccines remain in development. Health experts have been urging Americans to get their flu shots to reduce the number of cases this winter."", 
""The CDC in preliminary estimates said 38 million Americans got the flu in the 2019-20 season, and 22,000 died. In the particularly harsh 2017-18 season, about 61,000 people died, according to CDC estimates. So far, more than 210,000 Americans have died from Covid-19 this year, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University, even as most people have sharply restricted their movements and interactions."", ""Mr. Trump has repeatedly pressed states and cities to roll back restrictions on businesses and to reopen schools, after closures related to the outbreak last spring pummeled the economy and upended education and child care. But continued new cases in much of the country have slowed the return to normalcy, with restaurants, retailers and other businesses struggling to remain viable."", 
""Mr. Trump’s decision to continue dismissing a virus for which he was hospitalized for three days signaled he didn’t intend to change his message on the virus. When he returned to the White House on Monday, after receiving a level of care unavailable to most Americans, he took off his mask as he posed for pictures on a balcony."", ""The president was isolated in the White House residence, not the West Wing, where many senior aides work. Aides have set up office space for him in the residence, but it isn’t known if the president will remain there. Doctors say his condition is improving but declined to detail additional measures put in place at the White House to protect staff."", 
""First lady Melania Trump, who was also infected, continues to rest and is doing well, an aide said.

While this suggested little impact on infection rates from opening the schools, it was possible that the unique environment of U.S. public schools would cause different outcomes."", 
""But they’re about the same.

Her data—covering almost 200,000 kids across 47 states from the last two weeks of September—showed a Covid-19 case rate of 0.13% among students and 0.24% among staff. That’s a shockingly and wonderfully low number. By comparison, the current overall U.S. case rate is 2.6%, an order of magnitude higher."", 
""Other research has shown that hospitalization and fatality rates for school-age children are also extremely low. People 19 and younger account for only 1.2% of Covid-19 hospitalizations in the U.S. during the peak of the pandemic. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that of all Covid-19 deaths up to Oct. 10, only 74 were of children under age 15.

""What about teachers? We still don’t have hard information on the fatality rates for American teachers, but the new data have shown that Covid-19 case rates are low for staff working in the schools. That said, opening schools in other countries has had little impact on the fatality rates of teachers. Sweden never shut its schools, and teachers there have had the same fatality rate during this pandemic as IT technicians, who can often work from home.

Operating on regular schedules—such that an identical vessel departs Shanghai every Wednesday, stops in Singapore nine days later and arrives in Antwerp five weeks hence, with tight connections to barges and freight trains—intermodal container transport gave manufacturers and retailers the confidence to plan tightly organized long-distance supply chains. Before Emma, each new generation of ships since the dawn of the container age in 1956 had been slightly larger than the one before. The rationale was straightforward: On a per-container basis, a larger vessel cost less to build and operate than a smaller one, allowing the owner to undercut competitors’ cargo rates and still earn a healthy profit."", 
""Their size was expected to give Emma and her sister ships an immense cost advantage on the most important route in shipping, the roughly 14,000-mile haul between China and northern Europe. Maersk forecast in 2006 that a global trade boom would double the demand for container shipping by 2016. Its concern was having enough ships to handle all that cargo."", ""The major ship lines, almost all of which were state run or family controlled, felt compelled to follow Maersk’s lead. Megaship mania took hold, and orders for ships even larger than Emma flooded Asian shipyards. With the help of low interest rates and generous shipbuilding subsidies from the Chinese and South Korean governments, ships were to be had for far less than the true cost of building them. But the expected trade boom never occurred. Instead, international trade collapsed amid the financial crisis in 2008-09, and when it picked up again, its growth was far weaker than before. In the decade before the crisis, trade had expanded by 78%. In the decade after 2008, it increased less than half as much. Merchandise trade—exports plus imports—came to 51% of the world’s economic output in 2008, but hasn’t reached that share again."",

Then the Covid-19 pandemic hit."", ""Brazil went on a spending spree that is one of the most generous of any developing nation, but puts at risk the public finances of a country that has long teetered on the edge of a fiscal crisis. Brazil is facing a budget shortfall this year of more than 12% of gross domestic product, and public debt is on course to end this year at as much as 100% of GDP, up from 76% last year and far higher than the South American average."", 
""As the disease has ravaged the country, killing more than 160,000 Brazilians, Mr. Bolsonaro has been giving out as much as $10 billion a month to help the poor and shore up his popularity. Privatizations have been put on hold."", ""The handouts have lifted Mr. Bolsonaro’s approval ratings to a record high even as he faces widespread criticism from health experts over his handling of the pandemic."", ""For Mr. Guedes, a crusader for small government and free markets, the level of spending is new and dangerous territory. Ballooning government debt threatens to spur inflation and an exodus from Brazilian assets, which would be disastrous for long-term growth, according to economists."", 
""“We know we are going into the jungle for a while, but we will be back,” Mr. Guedes, Brazil’s economy minister, told The Wall Street Journal in an interview, saying the country would soon return to the administration’s original plan to reduce the role of the state in Brazilians’ lives."", ""Some investors aren’t convinced. While bankers, investors and others in Brazil’s financial markets said they haven’t lost faith in Mr. Guedes himself, they are beginning to question whether the president, who has acknowledged he knows little about economics, is still listening."", 
""The populist leader has already talked about introducing a new permanent social-welfare program to replace Bolsa Família, the widely praised monthly stipend for the poor. That is raising fears among investors that the president is giving priority to votes over financial stability as Brazil’s municipal elections this month draw near."", ""“The market is worried and bracing for the fiscal situation to worsen,” said Marco Saravalle, a São Paulo-based investment strategist. While Mr. Bolsonaro had been focusing on job creation to cement his popularity, seemingly adopting the proverb that it is better “to teach a man to fish” than to give him handouts, the pandemic changed that, said Mr. Saravalle. “The president decided to give him the fish instead,” he added."", 
""Some investors worry it is only a matter of time before Mr. Guedes quits or is fired. Since Mr. Bolsonaro took office in January last year, almost a dozen ministers have either resigned or been fired from his cabinet as the fiery ex-army captain has relied ever more on loyal former members of the military to help him run the government."", ""In August, two members of the finance minister’s economic team responsible for privatizations and debureaucratization resigned in frustration over the pace of their projects."", 
"""", ""Mr. Guedes, 71 years old, said that he won’t be fired and has no intention of leaving. “The president supports me—that hasn’t changed,” he said."", ""A son of middle-class parents and a co-founder of what became Latin America’s largest investment bank, BTG Pactual, Mr. Guedes said he joined Mr. Bolsonaro’s government because he saw a chance to implement policies inspired by the likes of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher to reduce the size of Brazil’s government. His support during Mr. Bolsonaro’s election campaign was crucial to gaining the votes of centrists and business leaders, sealing the conservative’s victory."", 
""He praised Mr. Bolsonaro’s refusal to resort to pork-barrel politics and his frankness. “He’s blunt, and so am I,” said Mr. Guedes. Both men strained relations with France last year by calling the French first lady, Brigitte Macron, ugly. Mr. Guedes also stoked controversy at home this year by referring to Brazil’s public servants as parasites. Mr. Guedes apologized for both incidents, saying he didn’t mean to offend anyone."", ""Mr. Guedes said he had initially proposed cash handouts during the pandemic of about $35 a month, but met resistance from Congress and Mr. Bolsonaro, who likes to call him by his initials, PG. “The president told me, ‘PG, stop being so stingy,’” Mr. Guedes said."", 
""The administration eventually settled on triple Mr. Guedes’s suggestion, paying $105 a month from April to September to about 66 million Brazilians, one of the most generous responses to the pandemic in the region. Under pressure from voters, Mr. Bolsonaro extended the program for another four months until December, but halved the payouts to just over $50."", ""The spending, which Mr. Guedes tried to limit, has allowed Brazil to weather the worst of the economic fallout from the pandemic. After a near-10% contraction in the second quarter, Brazil’s economy is poised for something of a “V-shaped” recovery, he said. The spending has even allowed poverty rates in Brazil to fall."", 
""But Mr. Guedes knows the fix is only temporary."", ""“We need to get back to the structural reforms to make sure that the spending increase was transitory, not permanent,” he said."", ""The government has been planning to overhaul the tax system to make it more business-friendly, and sell off state assets such as the power company\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Eletrobras\n\n\n      and the country’s mail service, Correios. Brazil is also poised to approve legislation in coming weeks to make the central bank independent, he said."", 
""When he took the role, Mr. Guedes promised the country wouldn’t need to break its all-important spending cap. In 2016, Brazil passed a constitutional amendment that effectively freezes federal funding for the next two decades in line with inflation—a vital fiscal anchor for a country where politicians have often spent their way out of political crises."", ""This year’s expenditure at the height of the pandemic won’t count toward the spending cap because that is considered an emergency. But if Mr. Bolsonaro insists on maintaining the payments into next year, it will be harder to justify their exclusion, likely breaking the cap, economists said."", 
""André Perfeito, chief economist at the São Paulo-based brokerage Necton, said he believes Brazil’s economic recovery will be slower than that predicted by Mr. Guedes, and that the country’s spending cap will likely be broken."", ""“The whole political class is in a tough spot,” said Mr. Perfeito. It will be hard to wean millions of Brazilians off the emergency handouts especially as unemployment remains high, while public services will face more demand next year as cash-strapped Brazilians rely ever more on public-health services and schools. A second wave of Covid-19 infections could also slow the recovery and increase public expenditure, he said."",

Produced by the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics Evaluation, or IHME, the study garnered immediate acclaim."", ""More than 100 news outlets trumpeted the study’s findings in the days following its publication—“The Price for Not Wearing Masks: Perhaps 130,000 Lives” was the  New York Times ’s  headline—and a few hundred more articles have been written since. Reporting was often paired with calls for a national mask mandate, echoing President-elect Biden and now Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious-disease official. The study was also invoked by Francis Collins, head of the National Institutes of Health, to push for stricter masking requirements. Recognizing the potential importance, Nature Medicine rushed the study into print after an expedited peer-review process that took only seven days to complete."", 
""Unfortunately, the IHME modelers’ findings contained an error that even minimal scrutiny should have caught. The projected number of lives saved, and the implied case for a mask mandate, are based on a faulty statistic. Using a months-old survey, IHME modelers assumed erroneously that the U.S. mask-adoption rate stood at only 49% as of late September, and therefore had plenty of room to increase to “universal adoption,” defined as 95%, or to a more plausible 85%. According to more recent survey findings, however, America’s mask-adoption rate has hovered around 80% since the summer."", 
""New numbers would completely alter the IHME study’s findings. If 80% of Americans already wear masks, a new mandate could add only a few percentage points to the mask-adoption rate instead of nearly doubling it. Additional gains would be small and certainly nowhere near 130,000 lives saved."", ""The study’s documentation suggests the 49% figure came from survey data collected by the data-analytics firm Premise between April 23 and June 26. Although the paper in Nature Medicine explicitly labeled these data as current as of Sept. 21, they weren’t. And other surveys paint a very different picture. The YouGov/Economist tracking poll finds that the U.S. mask-usage rate skyrocketed in late spring and hit 78% on July 14. It has hovered in the high 70s and low 80s ever since."",

But even the most stringent lockdown was essentially a fiction for essential workers and the working poor, who had to perform their jobs despite the uncertainty and risk. For those confined to their homes and those who had no choice but to leave them, the mental and physical toll has been immense. It is past time to deploy a strategy that protects the vulnerable while interrupting airborne viral transmission in places where people come together. A balanced and layered approach can help open clinics, schools, businesses, houses of worship and society in general."", 
""Many are surprised to learn that there are low-cost and effective approaches already in widespread use outside the U.S. that can provide focused protection for the vulnerable and prevent transmission of viruses in indoor settings. The installation of a simple technology that deactivates germs could make public spaces safer against viruses and bacteria for decades. Also, while new vaccines are making the headlines, a nearly century-old vaccine that costs pennies per dose and is already used by hundreds of millions of people world-wide can help reduce severe outcomes from respiratory infections."", 
""The former tool is upper-room UVC germicidal lighting. These fixtures look like glorified bug-zappers, but the bugs they zap are viruses and bacteria, not insects. The technology has been around since 1937, when it was first used against a measles outbreak—an airborne virus more contagious than Covid-19—in a Philadelphia school. Studies show that when optimally used in concert with good ventilation systems, UVC germicidal lighting provides the same effect as completely replacing the air in a room more than 10 times an hour. This reduces transmission and is a safe, effective layer of protection against threatening airborne diseases in crowded indoor settings."", 
""The devices are manufactured in America and have been supplied to U.S.-funded programs around the world through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Agency for International Development. Outfitting indoor public spaces with these devices would cost considerably less than the trillions already spent by the federal government to mitigate the economic impact of this crisis. Our data from implementation of this approach in Oklahoma City indicate that installing these bug zappers in a typical building costs less than $6 a square foot. Maintenance and upkeep are cheap and simple. From Utica College in New York to the Salvation Army of Central Oklahoma, and from Los Angeles International Airport to the Cambridge Friends School in Massachusetts, these lights are already on and providing a layer of important protection."", 
""The second tool is a vaccine that hundreds of millions of people have taken for years with almost no side effects—the antituberculosis vaccine BCG. It has been used for almost a century to protect the most vulnerable against tuberculosis and can be almost immediately produced in large quantities at low cost. A study published last month in the journal Cell showed that BCG vaccination triggers a general immune response that decreases viral respiratory tract infections by 79% among the elderly."",

The company, which was founded in 2005 and is based in San Francisco, is also known for its “ask me anything” digital town halls with celebrities and politicians. It described its daily user count amid a continuing effort to attract more advertisers to its platform, which most marketers consider experimental."", 
""“We’re sharing [daily active users] for the first time as a more accurate reflection of our user growth and to be more in-line with industry reporting,” said\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Jen Wong,\n\n\n\n      chief operating officer of Reddit. “We’re focused on daily usership and increasing this number as we continue to grow our community and scale our advertising business.”"", ""Reddit’s number pales compared with that of\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Facebook Inc.,\n\n\n      which said it averaged 1.82 billion daily active users on its namesake social network in September, and is less than a third that of\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Twitter Inc.,\n\n\n      which said it averaged 187 million monetizable daily users in the third quarter."",

Direct ad revenues are based on deals conducted by Reddit’s sales team and don’t include revenues from advertising bought and sold through outside automated platforms."", 
""“Like with everybody in the ads business, it’s been a volatile year,” she said, adding that while Reddit isn’t profitable it is making significant investments."", ""Reddit is in the experimental bucket of budgets for advertising by companies in such categories as gaming, technology, entertainment, finance and beauty, said\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Susan Schiekofer,\n\n\n\n      chief digital investment officer for ad-buying giant GroupM, which is owned by ad-holding company\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            WPP\n\n\n      PLC."",

With these platforms, if you want to look for something that’s brand-unsafe, you can find it.”"", ""Ms. Wong said Reddit has taken efforts to ensure ads don’t appear next to content or conversations that advertising clients may deem objectionable, including by hand-selecting which communities serve ads."", 
""Reddit also offers three tiers of ad inventory—expanded, standard and limited—that advertisers can choose from to suit their comfort level, and offers clients the option to disable comments on their ads and to keep the ads away from certain keywords and communities."", ""“More advertisers want the expanded and standard inventory than the limited inventory, despite how important brand safety is,” Ms. Wong said."", ""Ms. Wong said Reddit’s future revenue growth will come partly by expanding the company’s ad business to new international markets.

The aim was to save the seriously ill and protect hospital staff from Covid-19."", 
""Now hospital treatment for the most critically ill looks more like it did before the pandemic. Doctors hold off longer before placing patients on ventilators. Patients get less powerful sedatives, with doctors checking more frequently to see if they can halt the drugs entirely and dialing back how much air ventilators push into patients’ lungs with each breath."", ""“Let us go back to basics,” said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Dr. Eduardo Oliveira,\n\n\n\n       executive medical director for critical-care services for AdventHealth Central Florida, which recommends its doctors stick with pre-pandemic guidelines for ventilator use. “The less you deviate from it, the better.”"", 
""Advances also include new drugs, most notably steroids, for severely ill patients."", ""As the U.S. surge stretches into winter, hospital ICUs are seeing record numbers of Covid-19 cases. Even with more effective treatment, the high volume has required a record number of them on ventilators in the U.S. last week, according to Covid Tracking Project data."", ""Vaccines began distribution in the U.S. last week, but shots for most Americans remain months away. The disease has killed 1.68 million world-wide, according to Johns Hopkins University."", 
""Last spring, doctors put patients on ventilators partly to limit contagion at a time when it was less clear how the virus spread, when protective masks and gowns were in short supply. Doctors could have employed other kinds of breathing support devices that don’t require risky sedation, but early reports suggested patients using them could spray dangerous amounts of virus into the air, said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Theodore Iwashyna,\n\n\n\n       a critical-care physician at University of Michigan and Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals in Ann Arbor, Mich."", 
""At the time, he said, doctors and nurses feared the virus would spread through hospitals. “We were intubating sick patients very early. Not for the patients’ benefit, but in order to control the epidemic and to save other patients,” Dr. Iwashyna said “That felt awful.”"", ""Ventilators can injure lungs by causing too much strain as the machines force in air. They deliver air and oxygen through a throat tube, which the body typically fights. “We’ve got gag reflexes that are pretty hard to go away, precisely to avoid things going into our lungs,” Dr. Iwashyna said."", 
""As a safety precaution, doctors and hospitals limited the access of health-care workers to coronavirus patients on ventilators, giving them fewer opportunities to check on them. That meant patients required more powerful sedatives to keep them from pulling out throat tubes. Sedation increases risk for delirium, research suggests, and delirium increases the likelihood of long-term confusion and death."", ""Subsequent research found the alternative devices to ventilators, such as delivering oxygen through nasal tubes, weren’t as risky to caretakers as believed. Doctors also gained experience with Covid-19 patients, learning to spot signs of who might suddenly turn seriously ill, some said."", 
""When the pandemic first overwhelmed hospitals in China and Italy, doctors questioned whether Covid-19 would require new treatment approaches. Better understanding of severely ill coronavirus patients in respiratory distress has increased confidence that they are similar enough to patients with other infections to rely on pre-pandemic guidelines for ventilators, according to doctors and hospitals."", ""Doctors at AdventHealth Central Florida use computers to select treatment options, and for Covid-19 patients, the system added options to calibrate ventilators using longstanding protocols, Dr. Oliveira said."", 
""The computerized guides have helped spread the use of pre-pandemic treatment options, such as the amount of air to push into lungs per breath, across its 20 hospitals and emergency rooms, Dr. Oliveria said."", ""Nashville-based \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            HCA Healthcare Inc.,\n\n\n       one of the largest hospital chains in the U.S., went a step further. Doctors get an alert from computers when patients aren’t getting the ventilator treatment that might benefit them. The company rolled out the alerts in June. Afterward, it compared treatment and outcomes for similar patients before and after the alerts. It found more doctors now follow the pre-pandemic protocols, which have reduced the number of deaths and shortened the time patients spend on ventilators, HCA’s chief medical officer said."", 
""Overall, survival for Covid-19 patients increased 28% from April to September at HCA hospitals, though the company didn’t break out figures for ventilated patients. Doctors can use their judgment to ignore the alerts when other patient conditions make it medically necessary, the company said."", ""Researchers and doctors continue to study Covid-19 patients who require ventilators, and some experts have called for flexibility from pre-pandemic standards for doctors to decide how to calibrate ventilators. “It’s personalization, that’s the key word,” said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      John Marini,\n\n\n\n       a professor of medicine at the University of Minnesota. “Guidelines are just guidelines.”"", 
""How have you seen ways the new Covid-19 surge has affected your community?Join the conversation below."", ""Before the pandemic, between about 30% to more than 40% of ventilator patients died, according to research. Numbers were sharply higher in the pandemic’s early hot spot in Wuhan, China. As the pandemic grew, hospitals in the U.S. reported death rates in some cases of about 50% for ventilated Covid-19 patients."", ""One study of three New York City hospitals found the death rate for all Covid-19 patients dropped to 7.6% from 25.6% between March and August after accounting for younger, healthier patients in the summer. Hospitals in New York were less crowded in August than during the April surge, which could increase mortality, the study’s authors wrote in October in the Journal of Hospital Medicine. The study also suggests patients may have benefited from new medications and improved treatment, they said."", 
""Gains in treatment may diminish in a prolonged Covid-19 surge if doctors and nurses are overwhelmed and hospitals must keep out visitors, said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      E. Wesley Ely,\n\n\n\n       a professor at the Vanderbilt School of Medicine, who studies the risks of intensive-care treatment, which include neurological damage and physical disability. Overextended doctors may again use heavy sedation if ICU teams can’t closely monitor ventilated patients, Dr. Ely said."", ""Less sedation combined with other measures also shortens hospital stays and improves survival, research shows. Among those measures: halting intravenous drugs for portions of each day to see if they are still needed, attempting daily to remove patients from ventilators and keeping patients moving. Contact with family also plays a significant role in recovery, research shows."", 
""Christopher Thomas,\n\n\n\n       a physician and assistant professor of clinical medicine and pulmonary and critical care with Louisiana State University Health, used heavy sedation on patients for a few weeks in the spring. It wasn’t his normal practice. “It felt like you were watching—being forced to watch—patients not get better,” Dr. Thomas said. He soon reverted to lighter sedation."", ""Baton Rouge General, where Dr. Thomas works, had also prohibited family visits to reduce contagion. In August, doctors decided it would be better to allow families to visit delirious patients to help with recovery, the usual practice before the pandemic."",

He was dizzy, nauseous and feverish. Doctors put him on a ventilator."", ""Ms. Walker, forbidden from visiting, spoke to and prayed for husband daily over an iPad. “Please come home,” she would say, and she promised him he could buy a guitar he wanted."", 
""Mr. Walker already had 10 guitars hanging on the walls of the couple’s home in a Baton Rouge suburb. He also plays piano—they own two—and a drum kit is set up in the dining room.

Many of the new technologies and approaches employed to create potent Covid-19 vaccines and therapies trace their origins to the desperate search, starting in the early 1980s, to slow the spread of HIV."", 
""AIDS has claimed 33 million lives to date, and 38 million people are currently living with HIV. There is still no vaccine. But since 1982, the U.S. has invested more than $76 billion in lifesaving treatments, quietly revolutionizing the development of vaccines and therapies for other viruses, including the coronavirus."", ""“Everything we do with every other pathogen spins off of things we’ve learned with HIV,” said Anthony Fauci, a leader in HIV research as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984."", 
""Scientists haven’t yet been able to develop an effective AIDS vaccine, partly because HIV is one of the most cunning, complex pathogens ever encountered. Like the coronavirus, HIV has a spike or envelope protein that binds to receptors on the surface of cells, but in HIV it doesn’t stay intact long enough to be efficiently attacked by the immune system."", ""Over decades of work, however, HIV researchers developed a better understanding of the complex workings of the immune system. They mapped out in detail how HIV invades cells and replicates, and identified weak spots in the virus that can be targeted by drugs. Using X-ray crystallography and later electron microscopy, combined with computer modeling, researchers created highly detailed three-dimensional images of proteins on the surface of HIV. The idea was to use the images to engineer antigens, molecules that generate an immune response and prompt the body to mount a defense against the virus."",

""Once again, Italians are asking themselves: Why is Covid-19 killing more people here than almost anywhere else?"", ""The answer lies partly in demographics, public health experts say. Italy has one of the world’s oldest populations, second only to Japan. Nearly one in four Italians is over 65, an age group much more likely to succumb to the disease."", ""Another factor: Multigenerational homes are especially common in Italy, potentially exposing older people to infection from their younger relatives.""

With vaccines finally being administered, we should be entering a joyous phase. Instead we endure still more inflammatory rhetoric and media distortion."", ""Americans need to understand three realities. First, all 50 states independently directed and implemented their own pandemic policies. In every case, governors and local officials were responsible for on-the-ground choices—every business limit, school closing, shelter-in-place order and mask requirement. No policy on any of these issues was set by the federal government, except those involving federal property and employees."", 
""Second, nearly all states used the same draconian policies that people now insist on hardening, even though the number of positive cases increased while people’s movements were constrained, business activities were strictly limited, and schools were closed. Governors in all but a few states—Florida and South Dakota are notable exceptions—imposed curfews, quarantines, directives on group gatherings, and mask mandates."", ""Mobility tracking verifies that people restricted their movement. Gallup and YouGov data show that 80% to 90% of Americans have been wearing masks since early August. Lockdown policies had baleful effects on local economies, families and children, and the virus spread anyway. If one advocates more lockdowns because of bad outcomes so far, why don’t the results of those lockdowns matter?"", 
""Third, the federal government’s role in the pandemic has been grossly mischaracterized by the media and their Democratic allies. That distortion has obscured several significant successes, while undermining the confidence of ordinary Americans. Federal financial support and directives enabled the development of a massive, state-of-the-art testing capacity and produced billions of dollars of personal protective equipment. Federal agencies met all requests for supplemental medical personnel and hospital-bed capacity. Officials in the Health and Human Services Department have told me there are no unmet requests for extra resources."",

As efforts ramp up, here’s advice from doctors involved with the vaccine rollout on how to prepare and what to expect."", ""Many people will register for a timed appointment, aimed at keeping wait times and the potential for crowds to a minimum—although the patchwork rollout so far has also meant many waiting in long lines. After filling out consent forms and receiving the shot, you’ll be monitored for adverse reactions for 15 or 30 minutes depending on your allergy history. In the case of a timed appointment, the entire process should take around an hour, says Julie Boom, co-chair of the Covid-19 Vaccine Task Force at Texas Children’s Hospital in Houston, which is now vaccinating eligible patients that already have records within the hospital system. Afterward, some people choose to go home and rest."", 
""In most cases, you’ll simply need your photo ID and proof of your appointment. Some places may require additional documents, such as employee badges for first responders to show they are eligible. Those getting vaccinated generally shouldn’t be asked to pay, so do ask questions if payment is requested."", ""For now, the two vaccines available in the U.S. are found to be similarly safe and effective, says Wafaa El-Sadr, professor of epidemiology and medicine at Columbia University in New York. Eventually, choosing one vaccine over the other may come down to scheduling conflicts, she says. The second dose of the Pfizer vaccine is offered 21 days later, while Moderna is offered 28 days later. “The only thing I would consider is convenience,” says Dr. El-Sadr."", 
""No food precautions are required. Staying well hydrated prior to the vaccine is encouraged for people who tend to feel lightheaded with vaccines or blood draws, says Gregory Huhn, vaccination coordinator for Cook County Health, a hospital system in Chicago."", ""Even if you are worried about side effects, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention doesn’t recommend taking fever-reducing drugs (known as antipyretics) before a vaccine shot. However antipyretics, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen, can be used following vaccination to treat any fever or local discomfort, the CDC says."", 
""In any public setting, there’s a possibility of being exposed to the virus. The vaccine dose received that day won’t offer additional protection, Dr. Huhn says. However, vaccine-site organizers are aware of the risks and take precautions throughout the process, which includes floor decals and furniture spaced at least six feet apart, along with strict masking and capacity limits, he says."", ""People are asked to stay at the site to be monitored for adverse effects, including allergic reactions, though these are rare. Those experiencing any post-vaccine sensations can call over a medical professional to address concerns. The monitoring occurs “within the line of sight of our nurses,” Dr. Huhn says. In some cases, Dr. Boom notes, feelings of faintness can relate to nervousness over getting the shot rather than side effects relating directly to the vaccine."", 
""While those vaccinated are asked to stay between 15 and 30 minutes, it is possible to have an allergic reaction or worrying side effects after returning home, Dr. Huhn notes. “Anaphylaxis can occur hours after exposure,” he says. If that happens, immediately seek medical help."", ""Adults will receive a vaccination card that includes the lot number and name of the administered vaccine along with a reminder to get their second dose. Those going for their second dose will need to bring this card with them. Your vaccination data is also recorded by the vaccine provider and stored electronically, Dr. Boom says. Later, you may need your vaccine document for work or travel purposes."", 
""While many experience no side effects at all, some younger people with more robust immune systems often have a stronger immune response to the vaccine, which can take the form of side effects including fatigue, muscle aches and soreness at the injection site. In previous research, “those over age 55 had less reactogenicity, because their immune systems aren’t as vigorous as those of younger individuals,” Dr. Huhn says. Those who have previously had Covid may also have a stronger immune response, he adds."", 
""Doctors say there is likely some protection from the first shot but, as the majority of participants in the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine trials received two doses, there isn’t yet enough data to say definitively how much protection and how long it lasts."", ""The second dose enables the immune system to provide long-lasting protection. Doctors strongly advise getting both shots, in the recommended time frame."", ""It takes time for your body to build protection after any vaccination, the CDC says, and the vaccines that require two shots may not protect you until a week or two after your second shot. “The protective effect begins to be observed from two weeks after the second vaccine injection,” Dr. El-Sadr says. She notes that the minimum follow-up for vaccine study participants was eight weeks and that information will evolve over time on the duration of protection."", 
""Precautions including mask-wearing and staying away from others are important even after you’ve been fully vaccinated, as the vaccines aren’t 100% effective, Dr. El-Sadr says. Late-stage trials showed Pfizer has 95% effectiveness while Moderna has 94.1%. Additionally, it is possible that even those who have been vaccinated can carry the virus without showing symptoms and pass it onto others. Research on this is still under way."", """", ""By submitting your response to this questionnaire, you consent to Dow Jones processing your special categories of personal information and are indicating that your answers may be investigated and published by The Wall Street Journal and you are willing to be contacted by a Journal reporter to discuss your answers further.

Alabama’s public-health system has been depleted by years of poor funding, leaving some counties with thinly staffed health departments or no department at all. Administrative and technological problems, including inadequate appointment programs and outdated software, have hobbled the effort."", ""Alabama’s telephone hotline for vaccine appointments initially fell short, with insufficient lines to handle demand, said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Dr. Karen Landers,\n\n\n\n       a district medical officer for the Alabama Department of Public Health.

The National Institutes of Health has prioritized monoclonal antibodies—essentially manufactured copies of human antibodies—which have shown promise against other diseases, including cancer."", 
""The rub is that mutations that alter the shape of the spike protein on the surface of the virus—as variants from the U.K., Brazil and South Africa do—can deform the sites to which antibodies bind before they neutralize the virus. Developing new antibody cocktails that target new variants could become a game of Whac-A-Mole."", ""The good news is that Gilead says remdesivir appears effective against the new strains. It is the only FDA-approved antiviral for Covid-19, and the five-day infusion treatment is limited to hospital patients. Antivirals, which stop viruses from replicating in human cells, are typically most effective early in an illness. So finding other effective antivirals, especially ones that can be prescribed to outpatients, should be a priority."", 
""Antivirals can gum up virus replication in myriad ways. Remdesivir creates a paper jam in the coronavirus’s copy machine so it can’t distribute copies of its genetic code. Scientists at the University of Texas last month published a study in the journal Molecular Cell in which they identified the key mechanism remdesivir uses to inhibit the virus’s replication. That could lead to the creation of more potent and perhaps ingestible drugs."", ""“What if you could take just one pill and that was all you needed to do?” as study co-author Kenneth Johnson was quoted in a UT press release. “That would make a huge difference in terms of the here and now.”"",

The Covid-19 pandemic is largely behind us. Most of the world has been vaccinated, though we have to tamp down occasional flare-ups and people sometimes still wear masks. While we mourn the millions who died, we have entered a post-pandemic world in which most things are more or less as they were before Covid-19. Travel and trade are unrestricted; everything from dinner parties and big weddings to stadium concerts and megachurch services are being held again; and economies are booming to keep pace with pent-up demand."", 
""Then, just as suddenly as Covid-19 emerged, disease detectives discover a fresh cluster of a new, pneumonia-like illness. Testing quickly confirms that it isn’t a variant of Covid-19 but a new influenza virus that jumped—somehow, somewhere—from birds to humans. The new virus is as infectious as the one that caused Covid-19 but four times as deadly. And unlike Covid-19, but like the devastating 1918 influenza pandemic, the new virus is particularly deadly to young adults—and, in this case, also to children."", 
""A horrifying influenza pandemic isn’t the only nightmare scenario that could be worse than Covid-19. Think of the hundreds of thousands of cases of tick-borne Lyme disease in the U.S. each year. In other parts of the world, some ticks spread Ebola-like illnesses, and if these infections spread to the U.S., tick-bites could also lead to a disease with the terrifying lethality of Ebola. Or a highly drug-resistant bacterium could spread rapidly. Or a laboratory could develop an untreatable, vaccine-defying strain of a virus or bacterium and—intentionally or by accident—release it into the world."", 
""The world wasn’t ready for Covid-19. Will we be ready for the next, inevitable pandemic?"", ""To prepare, we must start by understanding that the lessons from battling Covid-19 aren’t just about Covid-19. We will fail if we learn nothing more than how to fight the last war better. Now is the time to get ready and to realize that the costs of preparedness will be dwarfed by the price of disaster. Here are six urgent steps the world must take to become far more pandemic-proof."", ""We will have to respond rapidly to any potentially major new health threat. I suggest a goal of “7-1-7”: Every country should be able to identify any new suspected outbreak within seven days of emergence, start to investigate the event within one day and report it then, and mount an effective response—defined by clear, specific benchmarks for different pathogens—within seven days."", 
""These goals will help governments focus attention and resources. Part of the reluctance to fund health preparedness has been a lack of simple measurements of progress. One reason for the broad bipartisan support for the global battles against HIV and malaria has been the appeal, to American politicians and voters alike, of clear metrics: the numbers of people treated, bed-nets distributed, lives saved. For HIV, the goal has been what the U.N. calls “90-90-90”—ensuring that 90% of people infected with HIV know their status, getting sustained treatment to 90% of those diagnosed and suppressing the viral load of 90% of the people on treatment. This strategy has turned concrete, lifesaving outcomes into targets for global action. Meeting the 7-1-7 goal, or something like it, is essential to a safer planet, but it won’t be easy. It will require several other steps."", 
""The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have learned a crucial lesson over the past two decades: The best emergency responses use everyday systems that are robust enough to scale up in an emergency. Yet efforts to strengthen such systems are often unfocused. Enhancing countries’ capacities will require substantial resources, robust technical assistance and an insistence on accountability."", ""As noted in a recent study by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, a global-health research group at the University of Washington School of Medicine, annual funding for global health in 2019 was an estimated $41 billion (less than 20% of which came from the U.S.). Of that total, the group estimated that less than 1% was for pandemic preparedness—some $374 million."", 
""Credible estimates of the amount needed to boost preparedness (beyond current investments) in low- and middle-income countries start at $5 to 10 billion a year for the next two or three years, continuing for at least a decade. This would come in addition to funding for better research, primary healthcare and other steps essential for progress. This is serious money, but it is dwarfed by the costs of an out-of-control pandemic, as we have all painfully learned."", ""Many countries will need technical assistance, which can be provided in part by the World Health Organization and its networks, as well as by the U.S. CDC. Such efforts could be complemented by additional regional public-health organizations. For instance, during the Covid-19 crisis, the newly created Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (a public-health agency of the African Union officially launched in 2017) has supported stronger disease-tracking and response systems, as well as a rapid expansion of sorely needed laboratory services on the continent. The European Union announced late last year a 20-fold increase in funding for the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (founded in 2004), and discussions are under way about creating similar regional disease-control centers in Southeast Asia and the Middle East."", 
""Stronger bilateral programs from the U.S., the U.K. and other wealthy countries can also help. China would be likely to follow suit and increase its own global public-health engagement. Structured well, this could be an area for U.S.-Chinese collaboration."", ""As recent studies in the Lancet and other medical journals have noted, the Covid-19 pandemic has underscored the central importance of primary care. New infectious diseases will be able to spread widely until patients can afford to go to health centers as soon as they feel ill, clinicians are trained to diagnose and report patients with unusual conditions, and health centers can provide accessible treatments and vaccinations. Most countries haven’t invested remotely enough in primary care—including the U.S., which performs abysmally on core measures of primary-care quality. This is a major reason for the rocky U.S. rollout of Covid-19 vaccinations."", 
""But even with more money and better technical assistance, the world won’t be able to meet the 7-1-7 goal unless it is organized for success."", ""As the lead U.N. agency for global public health, the WHO remains the indispensable anchor of such efforts. The organization has obvious limitations: It has often been underfunded, underpowered and reluctant to criticize governments. But it performs several indispensable roles: providing evidence-based public-health guidance, facilitating international collaboration, openly tracking data and helping countries to strengthen their public-health efforts."", 
""The WHO needs real reforms to meet its mission. It must be much better insulated from political and geographic considerations in the hiring and promotion of staff, as well as in its assessments of countries and recommendations to them. A stronger WHO could provide robust technical support to governments world-wide, especially through its proposed Global Strategic Preparedness Network."", ""As the world faces 21st-century pandemics, its international public-health structures still come largely from post-World War II agreements, with newer entities often grafted awkwardly onto them. The WHO was central to global health during the Cold War era, with a prominent role for the U.S. CDC too, but new entities—including new national and regional CDCs based on the U.S. model—have reshaped the landscape of global health."", 
""The two largest new public-health groups—the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance—have a combined budget that is about twice that of the WHO. Some new philanthropies, particularly the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust, are also large and influential."", ""The Global Fund is a major financier of programs to combat the three diseases in its title, while Gavi helps to negotiate and finance vaccines for lower-income countries. Both are international organizations that aren’t part of the U.N. and aren’t under WHO control. They receive their substantial resources from country governments, which have steadily increased their investments in the Global Fund and Gavi because of their efficiency, accountability and impressive results. But both entities were created without strong technical components (in large part to avoid alienating the WHO), and the WHO hasn’t been able to provide sufficient specialized expertise to ensure that Global Fund and Gavi programs reach their potential."", 
""These new entities have brought far more resources, energy and accountability into global health, but they haven’t substantially strengthened laboratory capacity, disease monitoring, primary care and other capacities essential to beating Covid-19 and future pandemics."", ""By working together to strengthen early-warning systems, share data, improve rapid-response capacities and strengthen health-protection systems world-wide, we can save millions of lives and trillions of dollars. This will cost billions a year, spent by countries large and small, but that pales in comparison to the International Monetary Fund’s October 2020 estimate that Covid-19 has cost the world some $20 trillion. The next pandemic could be even deadlier—and costlier."", 
""The world needs new financial mechanisms for readiness that can administer funds efficiently, offering accountability and boosting confidence for government investments. The World Bank, the African Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank and other entities can play important roles. Most important, the Global Fund could both generate and disburse funds for national preparedness. It could offer not just money but specific benchmarks toward the 7-1-7 goal and a new, pandemic-specific structure for ownership and oversight in recipient countries, involving ministries of finance, health, agriculture and more, as well as the private sector and civil-society groups."", 
""“An eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind,” as the old saying goes. Today, failures of global cooperation worsen the spread of infectious diseases by leaving the world blind to emerging threats. But by working together—by sharing data, knowledge and resources—we can increase our shared safety and security."", ""One neglected issue is improving laboratory safety. Some lab errors are inevitable, but we have insufficient global standards—and no global oversight—to reduce the risk of unintentional release of deadly pathogens, as may have occurred with influenza from an accidental laboratory release in the former Soviet Union in the late 1970s and is documented to have occurred with smallpox in the U.K. in 1978 and with SARS in China in 2004."", 
""Release of a biological agent could be as deadly as a nuclear war, and we need similarly vigorous systems of standards and inspections to reduce that horrifying risk. Advances in biological science have made it increasingly easy to create dangerous pathogens. A global compact to limit the number of laboratories, personnel and experiments and to more safely manage them could substantially reduce the risk. Even reaching this modest goal would be difficult: It would be expensive, require global agreement, face resistance by researchers, demand inspections and still fail to eliminate the risk of bad actors. But we urgently need it nonetheless."", 
""We must also reduce the risk of diseases spreading from animal populations to humanity. Most dangerous new pathogens emerge from human contact with animals, often because of our encroachment into traditional habitats. A global, enforceable compact, as proposed by Vanda Felbab-Brown of the Brookings Institution and others, would help to end the commercial sale of wild animals for food. In parts of Africa and Asia where bush meat is important to nutrition, we will also need economic measures that make it easier to substitute other locally available sources of protein, and much stronger programs are needed to reduce the risk of influenza spreading from birds and swine to people."", 
""What’s the biggest lesson you think public officials should draw from the pandemic? Join the conversation below."", ""Finally, the world must increase its manufacturing capacity for diagnostics, treatments and vaccines. Pathogens spread, so we cannot leave millions without access to the top-quality diagnosis, treatment and vaccines we want for ourselves. The Rand Corp. has warned of the dangers of “vaccine nationalism,” in which “countries push to get first access to a supply of vaccines, potentially hoarding key components for vaccine production.”"", 
""Such short-sighted behavior is both ethically indefensible and politically inevitable. One solution would be to increase manufacturing by countries with relatively small populations, which would be able to vaccinate their own populations without having much impact on the overall supply. The world could also work to boost manufacturing capacity through companies that accept global financing in exchange for their agreement to produce reasonably priced products that meet stringent standards and to distribute them in underserved regions."", 
""Exciting new technologies such as mRNA—which made possible the first two Covid-19 vaccines licensed in the U.S.—raise the promise of platforms that can be rapidly repurposed to tackle new threats. Globally supported mRNA production facilities could help end the current pandemic and, potentially, produce lifesaving vaccines and medicines that would create a sustainable business model, with sales to public and private purchasers between pandemics."", ""But more than all this, we need a new global attitude."", 
""We must act now: 2021 is the now-or-never moment to improve global resilience in facing future pandemics. We can’t know the character or the timing of the threats ahead, but they are inevitable. There is no time to lose in making preparations."", ""Public-health decisions are unavoidably political. Failing to act, in the face of Covid-19’s proof that the world is dangerously vulnerable, would also be a decision. This year, when the urgency of such work is so clear, we must make significant investments to protect and expand global health—or we and our children will face the dire consequences."",

Andrew Cuomo was awarded an Emmy for “his leadership during the Covid-19 pandemic and his masterful use of TV to inform and calm people around the world.” Turns out the Emmys had the right actor—but the wrong performance. Increasingly it looks like Mr. Cuomo’s real act was to keep people from finding out how many people in his state’s nursing homes died from Covid-19."", ""On Thursday the New York Post reported that Melissa DeRosa, the Governor’s top aide, admitted to Democratic leaders that the state had deliberately kept the true numbers from them.

Whether it’s prudent, if acquittal appears likely, is a related question. But wherever you come down on those issues, the House impeachment managers this week are laying out a visceral case that the Capitol riot of Jan. 6 was a disgrace for which President Trump bears responsibility."", ""Long before November, Mr. Trump was saying that the only way he could lose the election was if it were rigged. On the night of the vote, he tweeted, “they are trying to STEAL the election.” In his speech that night, he called it “a fraud on the American public,” and said, “frankly we did win.” Is it a surprise that some of his fans took his words to heart?"", 
""Instead of bowing to dozens of court defeats, Mr. Trump escalated. He falsely claimed that Vice President Mike Pence, if only he had the courage, could reject electoral votes and stop Democrats from hijacking democracy. He called his supporters to attend a rally on Jan. 6, when Congress would do the counting. “Be there, will be wild!” Mr. Trump tweeted. His speech that day was timed to coincide with the action in the Capitol, and then he directed the crowd down Pennsylvania Avenue."", ""Mr. Trump’s defenders point out that he also told the audience to make their voices heard “peacefully.” And contra Rep. Eric Swalwell, who argued the incitement to attack the Capitol was “premeditated,” it’s difficult to think Mr. Trump ever envisioned what followed: that instead of merely making a boisterous display, the crowd would riot, assault the police, invade the building, send lawmakers fleeing with gas masks, trash legislative offices, and leave in its wake a dead Capitol officer."", 
""But talk about playing with fire. Mr. Trump told an apocalyptic fable in which American democracy might end on Jan. 6, and some people who believed him acted like it. Once the riot began, Mr. Trump took hours to say anything, a delay his defenders have not satisfactorily explained. Even then he equivocated. Imagine, Rep. Joe Neguse said, if Mr. Trump “had simply gone onto TV, just logged on to  Twitter  and said ‘Stop the Attack,’ if he had done so with even half as much force as he said ‘Stop the Steal.’”"",

Last fall, with Ms. Beijen and her husband both working remotely and their kids, 11 and 9, in school two days a week, an ambitious plan emerged. “We were like, we can either sit here and have Groundhog Day every day, like we’ve been doing for the past several months,” Ms. Beijen said, “or we can do something with this time and really kind of make it matter.” It took a few months to assemble their visa paperwork (“like the biggest term paper I’ve ever done,” she said). They submitted it the day before Thanksgiving, received approval in January and departed a few days later."",

The modernized farmhouse the family rented is surrounded by orange and avocado trees; on weekends they visit nearby beaches and castles. The kids attend a private British school nearby—in person, five days a week. “So far so good,” Ms. Beijen said."", ""The Department of State estimates that some 9 million U.S. citizens live outside of the country. When Covid-19 closed borders and triggered restrictions around the world, thousands of them returned home—even diplomats, as some 6,000 were evacuated with their families. But other Americans are bucking the trend, leaving the U.S. to live overseas for anywhere from a few months to indefinitely. A number of hotels and resorts have been capitalizing on the appeal of extended stays, offering discounts and upgrades for bookings that are over 14 days or a month. Luxury travel company Embark Beyond launched an Embark Longer program, which offers discounts and amenities such as unlimited laundry service for resort and villa stays upward of a month. “We have clients staying several months in places like St. Barts and even Ireland,” said Jack Ezon founder of Embark Beyond. And several countries are offering special streamlined visa programs that allow foreigners to work legally for several months or a year (see “Stay Awhile” below)."", 
""These pandemic expats are motivated by a range of factors. Some want to give meaning to these bleak times, or take the opportunity that remote work offers to learn to live abroad. A chance to give kids a more normal life after months of confinement also plays a role. That’s what attracted Sugath Warnakulasuriya, a 55-year-old consultant who lives with his wife and son in Pasadena, Calif., where schools have been closed since March. “We tried to create as normal and magical an experience as we could for our son,” he said. But parks were closed and play dates a nonstarter. His wife, Angelina Horn Jorgensen, is from Denmark. She brought their 5-year-old son to her homeland last summer, and discovered a completely different environment. So they decided to stay. “Life felt a lot more normal,” Mr. Warnakulasuriya said. “The schools were going to be open. People are careful, they follow the rules, but it’s not socially crushing.”"", 
""Their son attends an international school in central Denmark, which was open for in-person learning until December, when it closed temporarily because of a spike in Covid cases. Before the latest spike, the family spent weekends at amusement parks and museums. Friends sometimes come over for meals."", ""When the pandemic hit last spring, work dried up for New York City-based photographer Julien McRoberts, 59. She and her husband, Jerry, a 61-year-old private-equity investor, felt confined in their 700-square-foot apartment. Last August, they moved to Los Cabos, Mexico. “We’re able to have a relatively normal life here,” Ms. McRoberts said. Residents always wear masks in public and there are sanitizing mats (that disinfects the soles of your shoes) in building doorways, she said. “We go out for brunch, we went whale watching. If you’re eating out, you’re basically outside, on the beach.”"", 
""Long before Covid, the McRobertses thought they might like to live, even retire, abroad. Lisbon appealed for its walkability, culture, affordability and tax advantages—transplants are exempt from local taxes for the first 10 years. But as so many people did, the couple found 2020 a lesson in adaptability. They started applying for Portuguese visas last year; the consulate closed, opened, closed again, and finally declared it wasn’t accepting U.S. applicants. Other countries were similarly chilly."", 
""“\n        ‘You don’t have to be young to be a digital nomad. You can do this late in life.’\n        ”"", ""“Nobody wanted Americans except our dear neighbors, Mexico,” Ms. McRoberts said. It was easy to get residency permits. It’s sunny every day, and she has become conversant in Spanish. They’re working remotely, and plan to continue when they move on to Lisbon. “You don’t have to be young to be a digital nomad,” Ms. McRoberts said. “You can do this late in life.”"", 
""For Jenny Recotta and Patrick Culver, figuring out where they could live was the biggest challenge in leaving Seattle. After marrying last summer, they quit their jobs—she is a labor and delivery nurse, he is in humanitarian response—and started looking for a place they could move to for several months. “Navigating every country’s restrictions was incredibly difficult,” Ms. Recotta said. They finally chose Dominica, despite knowing little about the Caribbean island. In less than a month, they bought plane tickets and organized housing. Since arriving in November, they’ve lived in four vacation rentals; the lack of tourists let them book places that would otherwise have busted their budget. The couple is currently staying on an 18-acre farm, surrounded by flowers and fruit trees. The view reveals a valley and even a distant slice of ocean. “It’s about as different as it could be from Seattle,” Mr. Culver said. “Life here isn’t perfect, but it’s pretty amazing.”"", 
""It can be hard to adjust to a new place, make connections, overcome language barriers and find community. It might be exponentially harder given the restrictions and face coverings of the pandemic. Ms. Beijen, whose family moved to Spain, said she misses social interactions the most. “We’ve met people at the school, but we can’t have play dates.”"", ""Ms. Recotta and Mr. Culver were initially frustrated by the slow pace and challenging infrastructure in their temporary home. “When you look at Dominica on a map you think it’s such a small island, it must be easy to get everywhere,” Mr. Culver said. “The roads are windy, there’s obstacles that you’re trying to navigate...things just take more time.” A nearly universal pandemic problem—that feeling of missing family members—can become even more acute when you’re overseas. Mr. Warnakulasuriya wishes he were closer to his mother, in Pasadena. Then there’s the homesickness. For her part, Julien McRoberts finds the sunny, largely seasonless weather in Baja pleasant but sometimes monotonous. “I do miss New York,” she said. “It’s hard looking at Instagram and seeing the pretty pictures of snow.”"", 
""It’s easier to relocate to these countries—from a desert kingdom to a tropical island—thanks to pandemic-inspired visa programs"", ""With international tourism almost at a standstill and many people suddenly able to work remotely, a number of countries have ginned up new long-term visa programs. Some are free, others cost thousands. They’re all designed to get travelers to stay—and spend—for months at a time.

As vaccine supply increases and more options become available in the coming months and years, there may be more scope for doctors to recommend  different types of shots for different populations."", 
""Currently, there is a little bit of wiggle room for people who are determined to get one vaccine over another.

Moderna’s shots, by contrast, have had less-extreme cold-storage requirements, making them more accessible for smaller pharmacies or offices in addition to larger venues. But a recent study indicated that Pfizer’s vaccine can be stored and transported at temperatures similar to what a consumer freezer provides."",

""When Kentucky warehouse employees complained that masks weren’t being worn at their site, when a group representing Illinois packaging workers asked if OSHA would enforce social distancing and when workers at a poultry plant said it wasn’t responding to a disease outbreak, the federal agency or a state counterpart took little action as infections at the sites increased, according to interviews, OSHA documents and health department records."", ""OSHA’s mandate, spelled out in a 1970 law, is to help ensure safe and healthy working conditions, by setting workplace standards and enforcing them."", 
""But the agency’s rules are largely designed to minimize chemical-exposure risks and injuries such as falls and electric shock—for the most part, problems that are readily identifiable and correctable. It has struggled to address the altogether different hazard of the coronavirus: invisible, lacking a sure corrective and permeating blurred lines between workplace and the world outside."", ""Separate agencies have roles in administering OSHA’s mission, and they  must be as effective as the federal government. Federal OSHA, which regulates workplaces in 29 states, sets standards for state agencies elsewhere."", 
""Federal OSHA said when the virus struck that it had rules in place to protect workers. Yet some state agencies took an opposite position—that there were no rules to enforce to address many Covid-19 concerns. Other state agencies created rules of their own."", ""Workers flooded state and federal OSHA agencies with complaints alleging their workplaces weren’t safe. On the federal level, OSHA’s compliance-officer staff had declined in recent years. Managers needed to limit the officers’ exposure to Covid-19. Compounding the challenge early on were shortages of masks and shifting guidance from authorities about who needed to wear them, in the face of a poorly understood threat."", 
""The Wall Street Journal identified more than 1,000 worker deaths from Covid-19 that circumstances suggest were linked to workplace transmission of the virus but that were never investigated by an OSHA agency, as of early February. Many hadn’t been reported by employers. The difficulty of determining when a Covid-19 death should be deemed work-related was one of the challenges facing OSHA during the pandemic."", ""It can’t be known whether different actions by regulators or others could have prevented any specific worker death from Covid-19. A virus in the workplace isn’t a hazard easily fixed, like a wobbly scaffold. But some health and safety experts argue that, especially last spring, OSHA missed repeated chances to ensure that employers did all they could to minimize risk to essential workers, those who must be on site producing goods or delivering services."", 
""“The pandemic has exposed OSHA’s great weaknesses,” said \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      David Michaels,\n\n\n\n       the OSHA director in the Obama administration. “Workers have never been so threatened by a hazard as they have by the coronavirus.”"", ""A report dated last week by the U.S. Department of Labor’s Office of the Inspector General said that a lack of OSHA on-site inspections remained a problem during the pandemic, and that it was particularly problematic that OSHA hadn’t been tracking which inspections were remote and which were on-site. “With most OSHA inspections done remotely during the pandemic, workplace hazards may go unidentified and abated longer, leaving employees vulnerable,” the audit found."", 
""In a response included in the report, OSHA said it would begin tracking its remote inspections and implement other recommendations raised by the audit."", ""James Frederick,\n\n\n\n       the acting head of OSHA, said in response to questions the agency is working with the inspector general’s office to improve its ability to protect workers from exposure to Covid-19 and advocate for those hit hardest by the pandemic."", ""It has always made clear the pandemic falls within its scope: “Eliminating hazards from COVID-19 remains a top priority for OSHA,” the federal agency said in a May 2020 note to staff."", 
""OSHA took the position last year that it was doing effective virus-risk enforcement, pointing to the federal agency’s citations of employers after 263 virus-related inspections resulting in $3.5 million in fines."", ""President Biden has issued an executive order that asks OSHA to consider setting a new, emergency standard to address Covid-19, a step the federal agency under the previous administration declined to take."", ""The 1970 law that created OSHA says employers are responsible for providing employees with a workplace free of recognized hazards."", 
""OSHA’s job is enforcing that obligation. To do that, federal OSHA has long had a policy of responding to virtually all complaints received, whether from workers or their representatives, sometimes by inspecting workplaces."", ""OSHA’s internal manual tells its officers to investigate all fatalities that result from an injury or illness caused by a work hazard, to determine the cause and whether there were any violations by the employer. Agencies typically do this by inspecting the workplaces to make sure they pose no risk to other workers."",

""Federal OSHA’s staff of compliance officers stood at 944 in January 2020, down from 1,106 in 2010. An official told Congress last year OSHA was trying to hire more, but doing so wasn’t easy. Mr. Frederick said the total now is 894. The agency has long been viewed as a less forceful regulator than some other agencies, with limits on fines it can impose and a lengthy review process for new regulations."", ""To assess OSHA agencies’ performance in the pandemic, the Journal examined inspection and complaint documents from federal and state OSHAs, as well as disease-outbreak data from state and local departments of health and data on nursing-home staff deaths from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS. The Journal catalogued thousands of worker deaths, scouring local news reports and obituaries, and interviewed family members and co-workers of those who died."", 
""To gauge whether worker deaths that weren’t reported to OSHA might have been work-related, meriting a report, the Journal applied OSHA’s guidelines. It also checked whether deaths occurred during Covid-19 outbreaks, as confirmed by local or state health departments, at the workplaces."", ""For a time last spring, OSHA told most employers they didn’t need to try to determine whether a worker death from Covid-19 was work-related. OSHA agencies typically use government records and media reports to identify unreported worker fatalities, but during the pandemic, they haven’t always closely monitored media death reports or data such as nursing-home fatality totals from CMS, according to government records."", 
""By looking at Covid-19 figures in five states and nursing-home data from CMS, the Journal identified more than 500 Covid-19 outbreaks involving some 6,000 infections at workplaces where employees had earlier complained to OSHA of unsafe conditions."", ""The Journal also found 180 worker deaths from Covid-19 that occurred four weeks or more after complaints to OSHA agencies that the agencies didn’t investigate beyond corresponding with employers."", ""Workplace safety agencies slightly increased their inspection rates for Covid-19-related complaints after the early pandemic months of March and April but were still below levels of general complaint inspections, according to the Journal’s analysis. Federal OSHA didn’t make substantial changes to its approach after it laid out its enforcement protocols and priorities in April and revised them in May. Some state OSHA agencies began enforcing governors’ safety requirements for workplaces. Several other states issued emergency OSHA standards."", 
""The Journal’s numbers are likely to substantially understate workplace-related employee deaths from Covid-19.

""Similarly, when an Illinois worker-advocacy group asked OSHA last spring about safety worries at a firm that packages soaps, a local director of OSHA replied that although it had received complaints of employers not following CDC guidelines, it couldn’t enforce these because they weren’t formal rules. The best OSHA could do was send employers an advisory letter, the director said in an email to the advocacy group, the Chicago Workers Collaborative."", ""OSHA later received two complaints from others about the soap-packaging plant, in Waukegan, Ill., alleging it ignored social distancing and cleaning guidelines, according to documents viewed by the Journal. In response to an April complaint, the local OSHA director told the employer, Visual Pak Cos., that OSHA wouldn’t conduct an on-site inspection, but the company should undertake one on its own."", 
""Visual Pak in early May informed OSHA it was providing personal protective equipment, taking workers’ temperatures and doing extensive sanitation, according to correspondence viewed by the Journal.

State records show at least 47 workers tested positive during the outbreak, according to documents obtained by the Documenting Covid-19 project from Brown Institute for Media Innovation, a program of Columbia University and Stanford University."", 
""Visual Pak declined to comment on the outbreak or on why it didn’t report the deaths to OSHA, nor would it say how many people work at the plant. The company described worker safety as its top priority and said its efforts include social distancing and requiring employees to stay home if they feel unwell."", ""In Kentucky, the state Labor Cabinet, which houses Kentucky’s Occupational Safety and Health Program, received eight complaints by the end of March about \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            United Parcel Service’s\n\n\n       Worldport distribution hub in Louisville.

""The Kentucky Labor Cabinet didn’t take immediate action on the complaints, according to information provided by Cabinet officials. By mid-April, two employees who worked at the site had died of Covid-19."", ""The spokeswoman said the March complaints weren’t formal OSHA complaints because they had been filed to the Labor Cabinet’s “KYSafer” portal, a hotline set up in the pandemic."", ""UPS didn’t report either death as a work-related fatality. Asked why, a spokesman said, “There is no way to know where someone was actually infected.”"", 
""OSHA took note of that problem in April and put out guidance saying that for employers not involved in health care or emergency services, the agency wouldn’t enforce its normal requirement that companies determine whether the death of a worker was work-related. Instead, they needed to make this determination only if there was objective evidence a Covid-19 case might be work-related."", ""However, new OSHA guidance effective May 26 said all employers should seek to determine whether any employee who died of Covid-19 had caught it at work. The new guidance said Covid-19 cases that arose during an outbreak among employees working together or in close contact with the public should likely be considered work-related."", 
""The essential workers in jobs such as warehouse work tend to be lower income, and Black and Latino employees are highly represented in their ranks relative to the population as a whole, studies by health agencies show."", ""One UPS Worldport worker who died in April was \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Howard Hopkins,\n\n\n\n       55.

""At the time, UPS let workers forgo masks if they signed waivers. The CDC on April 3 had urged everyone to wear masks in public, changing a prior recommendation of masks primarily for a smaller group, such as healthcare workers and people with symptoms."", ""The other UPS worker’s death appeared in news reports and was confirmed by the state’s governor during a briefing. Mr. Hopkins’s union issued a statement about a member’s death without naming Mr. Hopkins."", ""Kentucky OSH said it investigates worker deaths unreported by employers if it learns of them through the media or referrals from other agencies. In this case, it didn’t look into either UPS death because it wasn’t made aware of them, said the Labor Cabinet spokeswoman."", 
""Kentucky OSH officials inspected the UPS Worldport site at the end of April,  acting as agents of public health, according to the spokeswoman. By then, there had been about 50 complaints about the workplace to the Kentucky Labor Cabinet, records show."", ""In mid-May, Kentucky OSH personnel sent UPS a notice of deficiency about mask wearing and a lack of adequate distancing. The agency recommended remedies, including requiring that any waiver of mask rules be signed by a health professional. UPS told OSHA it would take corrective steps, including better distancing on shuttles. Kentucky OSH issued no citation, although it opened a formal inspection of the work site the next month."", 
""In August, Kentucky OSH received correspondence alleging a lack of proper mask wearing among many people at the UPS site. This time, the agency didn’t notify the employer, closing the complaint without follow-up."", ""Kentucky OSH didn’t consider this a valid complaint based on state law, according to the spokeswoman for the Kentucky Labor Cabinet. She said the letter had been forwarded by the U.S. Department of Labor, and it addressed union issues in addition to Covid-19 matters, which the agency believed it had already addressed."", 
""After the Journal provided information about the Worldport situation and  April deaths, Kentucky OSH opened investigations into the fatalities in December, Labor Cabinet officials said."", ""The agency later cited UPS for “failing to protect employees from exposure to Covid-19,” culminating a prior investigation, according to a Labor Cabinet spokesman."", ""He said UPS is contesting the case and in the meantime doesn’t have to abate the violations. The fines total $10,450, records show."", ""A spokesman for UPS declined to comment on the citations but said the company “has worked hard throughout the pandemic to provide for the safety of our employees and to comply with state, local and federal Covid-19 safety rules, as well as to ensure our people understand their personal obligations to the law and each other’s well-being.” UPS said it rolled out extensive safety measures, including requiring mask wearing after Kentucky’s governor mandated that in May."", 
""At the Worldport site, 838 members of the 11,600-strong workforce have been infected since the start of the pandemic last year, based on UPS’s reports to Louisville’s health department as of early February. A company representative said its rates are in line with the community’s."", ""The Kentucky Labor Cabinet said that workplace-safety officials have “diligently worked to carry out their permanent assigned roles,” plus new responsibilities as agents of public health, using technology as much as possible and safely conducting on-site inspections when warranted."", 
""Although many OSHA rules were designed to prevent injuries, the agency  worked on drafting infectious-disease rules for healthcare facilities after the H1N1 flu of 2009. It didn’t complete the process of formalizing them and they didn’t go into effect."", ""Besides specific rules, OSHA has a broad principle that workplaces must be hazard-free, known as the General Duty clause."", ""It isn’t often invoked. After a complaint to the North Carolina Occupational Safety and Health Division on April 6 alleged that a poultry plant was exposing workers to the coronavirus, the regulators wrote to the plant operator but said: “Since the allegation does not fall under an OSHA standard or the General Duty clause, a written response to this letter is not required.”"", 
""The operator, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Seaboard Corp.’s\n\n\n       Butterball LLC, did respond, with a note saying it was committed to safety and was considering supplying masks and erecting barriers at the 3,500-worker facility, in Mount Olive, N.C."", ""Two more complaints came in to North Carolina’s workplace safety agency.  One on April 17 said there were 17 Covid-19 cases at the plant and there was “a concern that the virus is spreading due to employees working very close to each other.”"", 
""That same day, the Duplin County, N.C., health-services director told the state health department “we are afraid that this plant is going to explode with positive cases within the next 4-7 days,” according to an email obtained by the Documenting Covid-19 project."", ""The North Carolina OSH Division again wrote to Butterball, reiterating that the agency had no coronavirus-related standard to enforce and again asking the company to investigate, but not requiring any response."", ""The Division said it follows federal OSHA-mandated protocols for responding to complaints. Federal OSHA’s standard letter, however, says employers should be asked to report the result of their internal investigations. It also says that a number of OSHA rules might apply to Covid-19 hazards."", 
""By the end of April, Covid-19 cases at the poultry plant numbered 80, according to county health documents. The county and the company jointly signed an agreement outlining safety measures."", ""In May, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      William Moore,\n\n\n\n       a 29-year-old worker at the plant, began to feel sick. After about a week, he died of Covid-19. Butterball didn’t report his death to North Carolina OSH. A  spokeswoman for the company said it didn’t believe he had contracted the virus at work."", 
""Mr. Moore’s family members said he avoided nearly all activities and social contact except traveling to and from the Butterball plant."", ""Butterball said its voluntary protocols at the time “were consistent with those of other manufacturers, evolving CDC and OSHA guidance and available” protective equipment. It said its measures included company-provided masks, physical barriers on production lines and a workspace reconfigured for distancing. It said it has a thorough contact-tracing system and is committed to best practices to reduce risks."", 
""In some instances, when OSHA learned of worker deaths that employers hadn’t reported, it asked the employers to investigate and then accepted their conclusions without doing a fatality investigation, which typically entails interviewing family and co-workers and inspecting work sites."", ""At a \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Walmart Inc.\n\n\n       store in Aurora, Colo., cashier \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Sandra Kunz,\n\n\n\n       72, and security guard \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Lupe Aguilar,\n\n\n\n       69, died within days of each other in April, deaths that Walmart didn’t report to OSHA."", 
""Local news publicized their deaths. OSHA sent Walmart a letter referencing a death and requested a response but didn’t open fatality investigations."", ""In a more than 300-page reply, Walmart told OSHA about its procedures to provide a safe work environment and provided information about Ms. Kunz, a company spokesman said. He said Walmart concluded there was no evidence Ms. Kunz had contracted the virus at work."", ""Family members said Ms. Kunz worried that Walmart hadn’t provided masks or guidance on how to handle coughing customers. They said she hadn’t been informed about any co-workers falling ill. Eighteen employees became infected as part of the outbreak, Colorado’s health department said."", 
""Based on Walmart’s response, OSHA closed the case with no citation of the employer."", ""As for Mr. Aguilar, Walmart said it didn’t report his death because he wasn’t an employee but a contract worker. The company pointed OSHA to his direct employer, Brosnan Risk Consultants, which said in a statement it believed neither company was obligated to report his death at that time."", ""An OSHA representative said companies are supposed to report any work-related death of a person they supervise even if the person isn’t one of their employees."",

Andrew Cuomo imposed strict lockdown policies—many still in place—and became the media’s golden boy. “The governor of New York’s morning news conferences have become part of the country’s new daily rhythm,” the Washington Post’s Style section gushed in March 2020. “He’s the strongman who can admit he’s wrong. He speaks fluently about the facts. He worries about his mother, and by extension, yours, too.”"", ""Gov. Ron DeSantis took a different approach and was pilloried. He was among the first to lift his state lockdown, adopting something resembling Sweden’s strategy of protecting the vulnerable while keeping businesses and schools open. “Florida Man Leads His State to the Morgue,” read a June headline in the New Republic. “Ron DeSantis is the latest in a long line of Republicans who made the state a plutocratic dystopia. Now he’s letting its residents die to save the plutocrats.”"", 
""A year after the virus hit the U.S., Mr. Cuomo’s luster has faded, and Mr. DeSantis can claim vindication. The Sunshine State appears to have weathered the pandemic better than others like New York and California, which stayed locked down harder and longer."", ""Mortality data bear out this conclusion. The Covid death risk increases enormously with each decade of age. More than 80% of Covid deaths in the U.S. have occurred among seniors over 65. They make up a larger share of Florida’s population than any other state except Maine. Based on demographics, Florida’s per-capita Covid death rate would be expected to be one of the highest in the country."", 
""Nope. Florida’s death rate is in the middle of the pack and only slightly higher than in California, which has a much younger population.

Then, once I miraculously scored an appointment slot by clicking incessantly, and entered all the requested information, it vanished like a mothball in the snow."", 
"""", ""“The Covid-19 vaccine demand heavily outweighs supply,” said a Rite Aid spokesman. “When the appointments are made available they are filled quickly.” An issue on the website, which didn’t hold your appointment slot when you’d start to input your personal information, has since been fixed, he added."", ""Congrats! You survived 12 months of pandemic! Now fragmented systems, shoddy websites and limited vaccine supply stand in the way of you and, well, the rest of your life."", ""It’s one of the most important human-vs.-machine battles of our time. And it’s made worse by the fact that most humans currently eligible to enter the fray are over 65 and not necessarily glued to a keyboard all day. Many sites don’t take appointments over the phone, either."", 
""But let me tell you, these systems are maddeningly broken, no matter your age or technical skill level. From national pharmacy chains to hospitals to local supermarkets, every Covid-19 vaccine-appointment website I’ve been to has made me feel like I’m bad at computers. And I’ve, well, you know, been reviewing computers for nearly two decades!"", ""So I set out to beat these Byzantine, Hunger-Game-like systems—and help eligible family and friends in the process, much like the generous, tech-savvy volunteers booking appointments for those in need across the country."", 
""Along the way I met 34-year-old Kris Slevens, an IT guy who’s booked over 350 appointments for New Jersey seniors. He let me into his process, which includes setting up a browser tool and adding a couple of browser extensions. You don’t have to be some hacker or ticket scalper to master these tricks: In the subsequent week, I booked 11 appointments in five states, including Maryland, New York and New Jersey—some on the websites of pharmacy companies CVS, Rite Aid and Walgreens."", ""Have you successfully booked a vaccine appointment online? If so, share your tips. If not, what have you found frustrating? Join the conversation below."", 
""Does this mean you’ll be able to score an appointment as soon as you read this? I wish. This whole thing is like a Vegas poker game: You can increase your odds with some skill and good timing, but a lot of it is luck of the draw."", ""(What this guide isn’t for? Cutting the line. My advice will help book appointments for people whose states have deemed them eligible for Covid-19 vaccination.)"", ""Because the U.S. lacks a centralized sign-up system, everything is localized to the state or county level. What works in one place might not work in another. So\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Facebook\n\n      \n        FB 1.55%\n      \n\n      groups have popped up in most states, with members who scout the local websites and available appointments."", 
""Many groups, such as the one that Kris moderates, help book appointments for in-need seniors. If you plan to ask for help from someone you don’t know, be careful. Don’t share highly personal information such as passwords or Social Security numbers. Having booked for many, I know that only basic contact info—name, date of birth, address, phone number and email address—is usually needed."", ""Head to Facebook and search for your state and “Covid vaccine.” In the New Jersey, New York and Maryland groups, I found active members providing minute-to-minute updates, links and even detailed spreadsheets about locations and appointments."", 
""People have also created\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Twitter\n\n      \n        TWTR 4.21%\n      \n\n      accounts to provide instant updates on appointment openings. To see how other states work, I offered to help a Maryland couple in their 70s. I followed MDVaxAlerts and set up push notifications on my iPhone. (Tap the little bell icon on the account page.) I was alerted to new openings at a CVS location and, within five minutes, successfully booked two appointments."", ""Some people have also built websites that aggregate all the locations in a state, such as this one in New York. Some other good resources for local information: Vaccine Finder, run by Boston Children’s Hospital; this AARP page, with information grouped by state; and this site that scans pharmacy sites for availability in different states."", 
""When you’ve picked a vaccine location, click to its website. Find the page that tells you whether appointments are available, and the page where you book an appointment. Yes, sometimes those are different. Once you have the links, bookmark them. I suggest using a laptop or desktop for all of this; working on a phone or tablet could slow you down."", ""If you’d like to get a vaccine through one of the big pharmacy chains, here are some specific tips:"", ""I didn’t use Walmart or any of the smaller pharmacy chains, but I suggest leaning on your local Facebook groups for information about timing and other site tips."", 
""In your browser, locate your autofill settings. This will allow you to store your full name, email address, home address and phone number in the browser. When it comes time to fill in all this, the browser will drop it in—no time wasted typing or copying and pasting."", ""“Any way that you can get a millisecond faster than the other person is crucial,” Kris told me, “especially when you can have 50,000 people vying for one cancellation spot.”"", ""In Chrome, go to Settings > Autofill. In Microsoft Edge, Settings > Personal Information, then click the edit button. In Safari, Preferences > AutoFill > AutoFill web forms > Using information from my contacts."", 
""Now the hard part: Staying up-to-date on these sites and available appointments. Appointments can disappear minutes after they’re released, so in addition to the Twitter and Facebook resources, I’ve used two tools to try to catch them."", ""The first is a browser extension called Page Refresh. It will refresh the page you’re on every few seconds or minutes, without you clicking anything. I keep this open on my second monitor. It’s available for Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge (and similar extensions are available for other browsers). The Page Refresh developer says the extension doesn’t collect any user data."", 
""One important tip: If you see an open appointment, stop the refresher ASAP. If it refreshes while you’re inputting information, you could lose your place."", ""That solution requires you to keep your eyes on the page. A tool called Visualping can do the watching for you. You tell the service’s website or browser extension what website to monitor, then you highlight the part of the site that you expect to change—in this case something that reads “no appointments” or “appointments booked.” If it changes, you get a computer notification or an email alert."", 
""For sites such as Walgreens and CVS that require your ZIP Code to check for open appointments, you can set that up with Visualping’s advanced tools as well."", ""The free version of Visualping lets you watch two websites, but it only scans once a day. That isn’t going to cut it. I tried the $58-a-month version, which scans every five minutes, and caught an email that led me to a successful booking on a hospital’s website. The free browser extension is more economical: It allows you to set the cadence to a minute but you’ll have to be at the computer to receive the notification—no email alerts. Visualping created this tutorial and list of Covid-19 vaccine sites to monitor."", 
""And then…you wait. When that appointment pops up, breathe. It gets intense. According to my Apple Watch, my heart rate has risen five to 10 beats a minute when I’m booking."", ""Move as fast as you can but not so fast that you don’t read the messages and the prompts. None of the sites are as slick as Ticketmaster, with that helpful booking timer."", ""Generally, you can skip adding insurance info. If it’s needed, you can show it at the appointment. And if you have the option to choose from a variety of days and times, don’t choose the first slots. Go for something in the middle, where demand isn’t as intense. Most people try to book the first available appointment, Kris said."", 
""Whatever happens, please just remember: It isn’t you; it’s the Covid-19 vaccine-booking website.

""Funds to implement Covid-19 testing programs will further help assuage the fears of teachers hesitant to return to the classroom and of parents worried about the safety of their children, said\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Dan Domenech,\n\n\n\n      executive director of the AASA, the Schools Superintendents Association, a national group representing superintendents."", ""“Anything that can be done to reduce the fear factor will definitely be helpful in keeping and maintaining schools open,” Mr. Domenech said."", 
""Despite testing’s potential benefits, only a handful of school districts have implemented regular Covid-19 testing programs for students and staff.

""Covid-19 screening can be logistically complex, sometimes requiring schools to secure waivers and deploy and train additional staff and guidance on how to follow through on positive results or when to seek confirmatory testing."", ""The funding can be used to establish diagnostic testing for students and staff with symptoms or those who have been exposed, in addition to setting up broader screening programs to regularly test students and staff, Carole Johnson, the White House Testing Coordinator, said at a media briefing."", 
""“We hope more schools will reopen across the country and more kids will be back in the classroom soon,” Ms. Johnson added. “We know that testing works. We know that it works to identify cases and slow the spread of Covid.”"", ""Tulsa Public Schools in Oklahoma has been randomly testing staff and older students through an optional program to find asymptomatic cases. The district was able to start the testing program through a partnership with the Tulsa Health Department and a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation."", 
""The testing program has added another layer of safety for schools as more students returned to the classroom this year, Superintendent Deborah Gist said. It is unclear what the impact of the Biden administration’s effort to expand or begin Covid-19 testing programs in schools would be on the district , Dr. Gist said, but it would likely allow them not to worry about the number of tests they have available."", ""“This announcement and this availability of funding will almost surely mean that we will have a much larger number of tests being done each week,” she said."", 
""The CDC also is releasing updated testing guidance today that includes recommendations for screening people who don’t show Covid-19 symptoms but may be contagious, a key source of the disease’s spread."", ""“Only in selected places have we capitalized on the benefits of how testing can be used as a screening intervention with frequent tests to identify asymptomatic disease and prevent clusters before they start,” CDC Director\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Rochelle Walensky\n\n\n\n      said at the briefing."", 
""Get an early-morning briefing about the coronavirus each weekday and a weekly Health newsletter when the crisis abates."", ""Teachers are now eligible to be vaccinated in most states, and Mr. Biden has asked states to make all adults eligible by May. Adolescents aged 12 and above likely won’t be able to get vaccinated until the fall, however, and the timeline for younger children stretches into early 2022."", ""Most children have mild symptoms or no symptoms at all when infected with Covid-19, and their outcomes tend to be significantly less severe than those of adults. Still, children can get severely ill and on rare occasions die due to an infection and can also transmit the virus to people at greater risk."", 
""In its school reopening guidance, the CDC currently recommends that schools should offer referrals to diagnostic testing for students and staff who are experiencing symptoms.

More than 73 million, or about 22% have received at least one shot."", 
""“The state of the pandemic, not any orders the government imposes about the pandemic, is what drives people,” said\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Chad Syverson,\n\n\n\n      an economist at the University of Chicago who has studied the phenomenon. “If the pandemic improves, people will go out at a higher rate. The orders themselves are icing on cake.”"", ""To measure the economic impact of government-imposed lockdowns versus the effect of voluntary distancing, Dr. Syverson and his colleague\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Austan Goolsbee\n\n\n\n      used cellphone data to track customer visits to 2.25 million businesses in commuter zones across the U.S. last year from January through May."", 
""Examining commuter zones allowed the researchers to compare consumer behavior in neighboring jurisdictions with the same exposure to Covid-19, but different shelter-in-place policies. If shutdowns were responsible for last year’s economic collapse, jurisdictions that remained open should have fared better than neighboring areas that shut down."", ""Instead, the researchers found a 60% decrease in consumer traffic, on average, with only 10% attributable to shelter-in-place orders—meaning that all businesses within the same commuting zone lost traffic, but the decline was 10% greater in areas that locked down."", 
""In addition, places that ended shutdown orders saw an equally modest recovery afterward—what Dr. Syverson described as a mirror image of the decline attributed to the closures."", ""“We repeated that kind of analysis thousands of times across all sorts of counties, businesses and metro areas,” Dr. Syverson said. “What all these results have shown is the primary driver of business activity is how comfortable or uncomfortable people feel going out to businesses given what’s going on with the pandemic.”"", 
""The findings were published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Public Economics in January. When the researchers followed up later, using 2020 data from May 18 through Aug. 16 and from Oct. 5 through Jan. 3, the results were nearly identical."", ""It’s important to note the researchers assumed the number of consumer visits corresponded to the amount of economic activity, which wouldn’t detect whether people shopped half as often but spent twice as much. However, a separate study by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago explicitly tracked revenue and spending as well as mobility and found something similar."", 
""That study linked county-level stay-at-home orders to cellphone records and consumer spending in the U.S. from March 1 to April 17 of last year."", ""What is your comfort level with going to various businesses, and how has that changed over the course of the pandemic? Join the conversation below."", ""“Our results are broadly consistent with and complementary to the Goolsbee and Syverson paper,” said\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Diane Alexander,\n\n\n\n      a co-author of the Chicago Fed study. “We find similar results to what they find when we look at a different, but related, data set of cellphone activity.”"", 
""They also found that mobility measures didn’t fully capture the drop in spending caused by lockdown restrictions."", ""Shutdowns were responsible for 16% of the drop in visits to nonessential businesses, the study found, but 24% of the drop in restaurant revenue and 45% of the drop in nonrestaurant small-business revenue."", ""The researchers also tested whether responses to stay-at-home orders varied by political affiliation and found that the effect was nearly identical across different kinds of counties."", 
"""", ""“An early narrative was that stay-at-home orders would be ineffective in areas that supported former President Trump,” Dr. Alexander said. “However, we find very similar effects in areas which voted Democratic and Republican in the 2016 election.”"", ""That result might seem surprising, but according to an election postmortem prepared by the Republican strategist\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Anthony Fabrizio\n\n\n\n      after last year’s presidential race, a majority of voters in 10 battleground states “prioritized stopping the spread of coronavirus over reopening the economy.”"", 
""The analysis—which was obtained by Politico—found that 57% of voters in five states Mr. Trump won in 2016 and 2020 and 60% of voters in five states that supported him only in 2016 favored limiting Covid-19 over reopening the economy."", ""Still, researchers at the Chicago Fed and the University of Chicago didn’t discount the value of stay-at-home orders as a public-health response. Lifting them prematurely might increase transmissions of the coronavirus without causing the economy to spring to life."",

But there is growing consensus that it is a significant disease that needs to be better understood."", ""In February, the National Institutes of Health announced a major initiative to study long Covid, backed by $1.15 billion in funding. “Large numbers of patients who have been infected with [Covid] continue to experience a constellation of symptoms long past the time that they’ve recovered from the initial stages of Covid-19 illness,” said NIH Director Francis S. Collins in the announcement.

""The Big Three of digital advertising—Google, Facebook and Amazon—already dominated that sector going into 2020. The pandemic pushed them into command of the entire advertising economy. According to a provisional analysis by ad agency GroupM, the three tech titans for the first time collected the majority of all ad spending in the U.S. last year."", ""Beneath the shift are changes driven by the pandemic: more time spent on computer screens; more e-commerce; a jump in new-business formation, and a steady improvement in tech giants’ ability to demonstrate a return on ad investment."", 
""Success breeds success for what some call the “triopoly.” The increase in shopping and spending on Google, Facebook and Amazon’s platforms is adding to their already voluminous data on users, giving them even more appeal for advertisers that look to target their messages."", ""“These companies that are data-science-driven get stronger and faster with a tailwind of usage—and Covid was a hurricane,” said ad-industry veteran\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Tim Armstrong,\n\n\n\n      a former Google executive and AOL chief executive who now leads Flowcode, a direct-to-consumer platform company."", 
""Many of the pandemic-driven changes likely are here to stay, say advertisers and ad forecasters. Still, when the pandemic winds down, it’s far from certain the tech giants will continue to increase their market share gains at this rate. With the vaccine rollout and easing of lockdowns, consumers could spend less time and money online and marketers could diversify their spending."", ""The growth in online advertising last year came as every other kind of ad spending shrank, with double-digit declines in television, newspapers and billboards, according to GroupM. And those online gains flowed heavily to the tech giants rather than to digital media sites and publishers that sell online ads."", 
""The triopoly increased their share of the U.S. digital-ad market from 80% in 2019 to a range approaching 90% in 2020, GroupM estimates. It’s a surge that comes as the three face scrutiny and litigation from various agencies at home and abroad over their dominance."", ""Google, in announcing plans to tweak its tools that help publishers and advertisers buy and sell ads, is moving away from targeting ads based on individuals’ browsing activity across the web. But that shift might wind up further strengthening Google’s grip on the online-ad industry, some experts and rivals say, because it could boost the value of the data flowing through Google properties such as Search and YouTube."", 
""Amazon this week said it will begin streaming Thursday Night Football by 2023, giving the company a high-profile franchise to take in ad dollars normally spent on TV broadcasters."", ""The three giants aren’t collecting just the money spent to advertise in the media but also some of the marketing dollars earmarked for coupons, catalogs and in-store promotions."", ""New-business applications in the U.S., which slowly climbed from 200,000 a month to 300,000 over a decade, shot up north of 500,000 in July and averaged more than 400,000 a month for the second half of 2020, according to the U.S. Census data. This proved a boon for the biggest tech platforms, which provide the kind of advertising that is often all a startup can afford. Facebook says it had more than 10 million active advertisers in the third quarter, up from 8 million in January."", 
""Meanwhile, many businesses of all sizes pivoted to e-commerce selling—and turned to digital ads to support that effort."", ""Before the pandemic, a little more than 10% of retail purchases in the U.S.took place online. That jumped to 16% in last year’s second quarter when lockdowns peaked, according to Census data. Though the rate tapered a bit as the year wore on, the trend strongly benefits the tech behemoths."", ""“The pandemic zapped us two years into the future on the e-commerce side,” said\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Nicole Perrin,\n\n\n\n      principal analyst at research firm eMarketer."", 
""Mondelez, the Chicago-based maker of Oreo, Ritz and other snacks, in 2020 geared up to promote some of its brands in the marquee television events of the NCAA college basketball tournament and the Summer Olympic Games in Tokyo. When it became clear neither would be held, Mondelez redeployed the money to digital advertising."", ""It doubled down on Google ads to capitalize on interest in online recipes among those homebound. It used Facebook-owned Instagram to host a Pictionary-like game in which an artist made images out of the cream in the middle of an Oreo cookie. For the first time, Mondelez spent more on digital ads than on TV commercials last year. Google and Facebook were the biggest beneficiaries."", 
""This year, digital advertising is projected to account for more than half the roughly $1.1 billion Mondelez spends on media world-wide. It was only about 30% as recently as 2017. TV’s share of the company’s ad spending continues to decline."", ""When Mondelez invests in digital advertising, it gets a 25% better return than with TV ads, the company says. It has found that its Google and Facebook ads do especially well, generating 40% higher returns than an average digital ad. The two now account for roughly 60% to 70% of Mondelez’s digital ad spending, up from less than 50% in 2017, the company says."", 
""The tech giants share data that allows Mondelez to understand its customers better, said the snack maker’s chief marketing officer,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Martin Renaud.\n\n\n\n      Google data showed Mondelez, for instance, that people tend to search the internet for healthier snacks in the morning and for more-indulgent treats as the day wears on."", ""When the pandemic struck, Google provided updated data that helped Mondelez craft relevant ads. The company switched from showing college-age consumers an ad about eating lunch in the library to one that read: “Made it through an online class? Treat yourself.”"", 
""Mondelez has been working with Google and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Target Corp.\n\n\n      to figure out how likely someone is to buy Oreos or Ritz crackers from Target stores after being served ads for them on Google’s YouTube."", ""“I can’t go to CNN or other platforms and be able to get that intelligence,” said\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Jonathan Halvorson,\n\n\n\n      Mondelez’s global vice president of consumer experience. Big advertisers like Mondelez still spend a lot on TV commercials, and most consider TV the best way to reach a mass audience, rather than any particular segment of consumers."", 
""As it directs more ad money to the tech giants, Mondelez isn’t working with as many digital publishers in the U.S. In 2017, Mondelez worked with about 150; it now works with fewer than 10."", ""For direct-to-consumer businesses, the pandemic provided an opportunity like no other."", ""Activewear company Vuori distributes through stores, but its main focus is selling via catalogs and the web. Facebook is a key part of its strategy. Besides enabling Vuori to monitor the performance of its ads, the platform’s tools let Vuori upload lists of its customers and then use Facebook’s algorithm to find look-alike audiences, testing and pivoting in real time."", 
""When the pandemic arrived, Vuori CEO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Joe Kudla\n\n\n\n      noticed something interesting in the data: The prices of Facebook’s ads were dropping at the same time as people were clicking at higher rates on Vuori ads for items like its $80 sweatpants. That combination sent its return on ad spending through the roof."", ""Vuori stopped traditional marketing such as catalogs and direct mail and shoveled every dollar it could into Facebook. It doubled its April 2020 media spending from what was budgeted, and saw sales quadruple. Facebook’s ad prices have since recovered, and Vuori has diversified its ad spending somewhat, but it has continued to increase its use of Facebook ads."", 
""A surfer and yoga practitioner, Mr. Kudla seeks to create products for people with the kind of active lifestyle he and his friends in Encinitas, Calif., have. But for finding customers, he says, Facebook beats his instincts."", ""“We could identify the age, demo and behavior, but ultimately the algorithm is much more powerful in terms of identifying people who demonstrate certain shopping behaviors,” Mr. Kudla said."", ""Performance-obsessed small advertisers such as Vuori are the reason Facebook revenue never stopped growing last year, despite the pandemic’s hit to the economy and then a summer boycott by some prominent advertisers over the platform’s handling of hate speech and misinformation."", 
""In the three years leading up to the pandemic,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Suzy Batiz,\n\n\n\n      founder of the toilet spray company Poo-Pourri, was focused mainly on building out the network of retail stores that carried what it calls a “before-you-go” spritz of essential oils."", ""Then Covid-19 hit, and one distributor refused to take a multimillion-dollar order already produced. “That was pretty painful,” Ms. Batiz said. “But as one of my mentors would say, crisis precedes transformation.” The company shifted focus from driving customers to stores to driving them to its e-commerce site and others’ shopping sites."", 
""That meant cutting all marketing spending that wasn’t digital, such as payment for promotions at\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Bed Bath & Beyond\n\n\n      stores or for events, while stores were closed. Ms. Batiz redirected the money to the web, especially Facebook. Sales on Poo-Pourri’s website surged 300% in the second quarter versus a year earlier and more than doubled for the year."", ""“This is our future,” Ms. Batiz said. “I don’t think we will ever go back.”"", ""Steelcase, which makes desks and other office furniture, spent roughly $1 million on advertising in 2019, primarily for print and digital ads in business publications to target facility managers, architects, developers and company executives. Most of its revenue came in direct sales to corporations or from its dealer network, which has showrooms around the country. Its business of direct selling to consumers was minuscule."", 
""As states’ stay-home orders spurred an exodus from offices last spring, Steelcase’s sales plunged. The Grand Rapids, Mich., company ramped up its small direct-to-consumer business, increasing its staff for that to 25 people from two."", ""How much influence do ads you see on Google, Facebook or Amazon have on you? Join the conversation below."", ""It stopped advertising in business publications and began buying search and social-media ads. Steelcase radically increased its ad budget last year and spent $5 million to $6 million on digital ads targeting people setting up home offices. About half of that went to Amazon search ads."", 
""“Everyone focused on Amazon, whether you needed toilet paper, spices, a Cuisinart mixer or an office chair,” said\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n      Allan Smith,\n\n\n\n      the furniture maker’s vice president of global marketing. “We decided to shift there as well, and it paid off.”"", ""For every dollar Steelcase spent on Amazon ads during the holiday season, it made $30 in sales, the company says. Sales for its business aimed at consumers are up 500%."", ""Steelcase plans to double its Amazon spending this year. Its research indicates the pandemic has changed work life for good, predicting that about 72% of businesses are likely to take a hybrid approach of working from both home and office. “The hybrid future is here to stay,” Mr. Smith said."",

Once we reach that threshold, many Americans believe, we’ll be in the clear, and the pandemic will finally fade into history."", ""But we are unlikely ever to reach herd immunity with Covid-19—it’s not how this nightmare will end. Although case counts are now declining from their winter peak, we fear another spike from potential super-spreader events following spring break, Easter weekend, Memorial Day and the Fourth of July, or even again after the end-of-year holidays. The time to double down on our efforts to stamp out transmission is now. We must develop what amounts to a national immune system to quickly detect and repel the new outbreaks ahead, not just for this pandemic but for future ones as well."", 
""“\n        About 43% of the U.S. population has at least some immunity against Covid-19—very far from the 80% needed for herd immunity. \n        ”"", ""Herd immunity is achieved when the percentage of a given population that is immune, from vaccination or previous infection, becomes such that each infected person transmits the disease to an average of less than one new case. The virus, finding inadequate numbers of susceptible people to infect, then starts to die out."", ""The threshold for herd immunity depends on the contagiousness of a given disease. For Covid-19, the best estimates suggest that at least 80% of people would need to be immune."", 
""As of this writing, 130 million doses of vaccine have been given in the U.S., leaving 46.4 million Americans fully immunized and 33 million partially immunized as they await a second dose. In addition, there have been about 30 million reported cases of Covid. Epidemiologists at the CDC and NIH estimate that perhaps an equal number of cases, some 30 million, have gone unreported."", ""How do you think the U.S. should fight the pandemic moving forward? Join the conversation below."", ""Leaving aside the question of how much these two populations overlap and the extent and durability of protection provided by previous infection, this amounts to about 140 million Americans, in a population of 330 million, with at least some immunity. That is just under 43% of the population—very far from the 80% needed for herd immunity."", 
""Worse, such math misses a crucial point: The virus is changing so rapidly that immunity to the Covid strain of yesterday may not protect against today’s or tomorrow’s strain. We now face the challenge of new variants that may elude immunity created by natural infection and possibly by vaccines as well."", ""More than 200 people have already been infected with a new variant named “Cluster 5,” emerging from farmed minks in Denmark. Covid-19 has also been reported in more than a dozen other species, including great apes, tigers, lions and snow leopards in zoos, monkeys, cats, dogs, pigs and some deer. There is no evidence yet of continual spillover from established animal reservoirs of the virus. But epidemiologists fear a worst-case scenario in which new variants continue to ping-pong among humans, domestic animals and wildlife."", 
""There is also the issue of vaccination rates. Many Americans cannot get vaccinated for medical reasons. Others have been left out of vaccination outreach or distrust the medical system. Children count as part of the “herd” but are not yet being vaccinated. Each year there will also be new births and in-migration of unvaccinated people. But the biggest challenge is the 30% of Americans who, in the most recent Pew poll, say that they will either definitely not or probably not get vaccinated."", 
""Worldwide, the greatest impediment to reaching herd immunity is not vaccine hesitancy or even the new, more contagious variants; it is the lack of access to vaccines. The global initiative called COVAX was created to procure and deliver vaccines for lower-income countries, but COVAX remains underfunded and will miss even its modest 2021 goal of delivering 2 billion doses. It is likely that, for at least the next couple of years, billions of people world-wide will remain unvaccinated and susceptible. As a result, new variants of the disease will continue to multiply, increasing transmission and pushing further away any hopes of herd immunity."", 
"""", ""If herd immunity is out of reach, does that mean we’re doomed? Not at all. But we must immediately begin to supplement the impressive recent rollout of vaccines with a comprehensive rapid-response system, modeled on the “surveillance and containment” strategy that William Foege, former head of the CDC, developed to fight smallpox in the early 1970s. Smallpox was eradicated from the globe in 1980—the first disease to meet this fate."", ""Surveillance in the smallpox campaign meant aggressive contact tracing: finding every case of smallpox, tracing it backward to sources of infection, tracing parallel chains of disease transmission, and tracing contacts forward to find those who would become at risk for infection. In the analog days of the 1970s, this meant going house to house to inquire, with more than two billion house calls in India alone."", 
""Today, time is of the essence in finding new Covid-19 cases. The disease travels at exponential speed, whether it is traveling between states, imported from other countries or spreading as new variants from animal populations. “Speed to detect” is one of the most important metrics in public health. Finding the first cases within days, when an outbreak still amounts to just a handful of cases, is essential. When an outbreak goes undetected for weeks, it can generate hundreds or tens of thousands of cases, and contact tracing and containment become much more difficult."", 
""Nor is just finding new generic Covid-19 cases enough. We need to know what variant of the virus is involved. Enhanced testing will be critical and should include faster and cheaper molecular and antigen tests, serology to detect immunity created by both infection and vaccination, and viral sequencing to inform vaccine and drug design. We will need to match new variants of Covid-19 with the vaccines most effective against them."", ""In addition to surveillance and containment, two other factors have been proposed to explain why the smallpox campaign worked so well. One was the efficacy of the vaccine itself. A few pin pricks from a simple bifurcated needle with freeze-dried vaccine conferred near lifetime immunity for almost everyone. The other factor was the relatively long interval—approximately 12 days—from exposure to disease, which was enough time to vaccinate identified cases as well as their contacts and even the contacts of their contacts."", 
""“\n        The global program to eradicate smallpox in the 1970s took place in a different era, against a different virus, and used a very different vaccine.\n        ”"", ""The global program in the 1970s took place in a different era, against a different virus, and used a very different vaccine. In some places it built upon and supplemented mass vaccination. In others, eradication was accomplished with less than a quarter of the population vaccinated. The program that brought Ebola under control by 2016, after a two-year outbreak, adopted some of these strategies as well. For both diseases, the paramount goal was finding and isolating cases early and giving just-in-time vaccinations to those most likely to get the disease next. The approach recalls what hockey legend Wayne Gretzky once said: “I skate to where the puck is going, not to where it has been.”"", 
""Until recently, the lack of faster immunizing vaccines was a stumbling block to adopting just-in-time vaccination for Covid-19. But recent news suggests that the vaccines now authorized for use might work. Despite the rapid onset of viral infection (an average of 6 days after exposure, with a range of 2-14 days), Johnson & Johnson has reported success in preventing moderate to severe disease as early as 7 days after the administration of its single-dose vaccine. In a real-world study in Israel, the Pfizer vaccine also prevented severe disease soon after a single dose."", 
""It is not too late to find, isolate and vaccinate those who do not yet have Covid-19 but are most likely to get it. It is not too late to use just-in-time vaccination to stop outbreaks in midcourse and prevent the spread of infection."", ""How do we find exposed people “just in time” to vaccinate them? The same way that we find people just in time to isolate them. We build exposure notification and tracing systems that find contacts and contacts of contacts most at risk of getting the disease."", 
""Before we had approved vaccines, Vietnam, Taiwan and Singapore remained Covid-free for several months with only testing, tracing and isolation. The common feature across the success stories with Covid-19, smallpox and Ebola is energetic contact tracing and isolation of those known to be infected and most at risk of infection."", ""Contact tracing has been difficult in the U.S. in part because most Americans no longer pick up the phone from unknown callers. Adding more sensitive, community-based tracers helps, as do new “low friction” tools to supplement manual tracing. One intriguing possibility is to piggyback just-in-time vaccination onto digital exposure notification systems that tell people when they (really, their phones) have been in close proximity to someone who is infected, offering them testing, support for isolation and vaccination appointments at the same time they are notified. Data from Ireland and the UK suggest that such digital systems find more contacts and find them sooner than other methods."", 
""Perhaps the most urgent policy priority is to develop a digital rapid-detection system by integrating information from all the sources now available. These include routine reports to health authorities from medical providers and laboratories; data gathered from contact-tracing databases; various digital and crowdsourced “participatory surveillance” apps like Flu Near You, Outbreaks Near Me and How We Feel; bulletin boards like ProMed; news scrubbers like GPHIN; novel risk assessment tools like NOVID; and statewide exposure notification systems. To be an effective tool for health officials at all levels, real-time data from multiple systems will need to be aggregated and assessed quickly, perhaps with machine learning, and presented in an actionable format. Forerunners of such systems already exist at the CDC and at WHO’s Global Outbreak And Response Network, but none, to our knowledge, integrate exposure notification systems, viral sequencing and just-in-time vaccination."", 
""So the task ahead is clear: We need to complement mass vaccination with a national plan that applies the latest innovations in discovering and diagnosing viral outbreaks. We must add just-in-time vaccinations, allocating a portion of our vaccine supply, perhaps 10% to 20%, for outbreak containment, and target each new outbreak with the vaccine shown by genomic testing to be most likely to succeed against it."", ""How to achieve these ambitious goals? The $1.9 trillion stimulus bill recently signed into law by President Biden provides vital resources for the effort, including $47.8 billion for testing, hiring contact tracers and creating safer settings for isolation. There is also $1.75 billion for surveillance, genomic sequencing, and “effective response” based on this data, and another $7.5 billion for vaccination, which could eventually include just-in-time vaccination targeted at new variants. Though a clear strategy doesn’t yet exist for creating a national immune system, many of the key elements are at least now partly in place."", 
""“\n        If we think of Covid-19 as a wildfire—and it surely spreads like one—we have failed to extinguish it.\n        ”"", ""But more needs to be done. The states should work together to establish a national outbreak alert and response network, connecting data scientists, public health experts and technologists, and each state needs to establish a core group of first responders to complement the CDC’s state epidemiologists—trained local specialists ready to deploy to current and future outbreaks."", 
""If we think of Covid-19 as a wildfire—and it surely spreads like one—we have failed to extinguish it. We still have fires burning all over the country. At any point, with a shift of the wind (think variants, less masking, relaxed physical distancing), the fires will ignite again, burn bigger and spread further. We need the epidemiological equivalent of the “hotshot” crews that the forest service deploys to the hottest part of the fires it fights."", ""Americans should not expect some kind of “all clear” signal on Covid-19 in the months ahead. But if we have substantial numbers of vaccinated Americans, robust rapid detection and successful outbreak containment, we can accelerate the journey to “normal-ish.”"", 
""Every year, up to five novel viral pathogens like Zika, swine flu or West Nile “spill over” from animals to humans. We have been unlucky with Covid-19, but perhaps it will focus our attention on how lucky we have been that the genomic roulette wheel has not given us more lethal bird flus or other coronavirus pandemics. A robust national immune system will help us to control Covid-19 and leave us better prepared for the pandemics yet to come."", ""—Dr. Brilliant is the founder and CEO of the firm Pandefense Advisory and was a WHO medical officer from 1973-81 working on the eradication of smallpox.

The idea is simple: Once you’ve received your shots, you get a document or phone app, which you flash to gain entry to previously locked-down venues—restaurants, theaters, sports arenas, offices, schools."", ""It sounds like a way of easing coercive lockdown restrictions, but it’s the opposite. To see why, consider dining. Restaurants in most parts of the U.S. have already reopened, at limited capacity in some places. A vaccine passport would prohibit entry by potential customers who haven’t received their shots. It would restrict the freedom even of those who have: If you’re vaccinated but your spouse isn’t, forget about dining out as a couple."", 
""Planes and trains, which have continued to operate throughout the pandemic, would suddenly be off-limits to the unvaccinated. The only places where restrictions would be relatively eased would be those still fully locked down, such as many live-event venues and schools. Yet even there, the passport idea depends on keeping the underlying restrictions in place—giving officials an incentive to do so for much longer as leverage to overcome vaccine resistance."", ""The vaccine passport should therefore be understood not as an easing of restrictions but as a coercive scheme to encourage vaccination. Such measures can be legitimate: Many schools require immunization against common childhood illnesses, and visitors to some African countries must be vaccinated against yellow fever. But Covid vaccine passports would harm, not benefit, public health."", 
""The idea that everybody needs to be vaccinated is as scientifically baseless as the idea that nobody does. Covid vaccines are essential for older, high-risk people and their caretakers and advisable for many others. But those who’ve been infected are already immune. The young are at low risk, and children—for whom no vaccine has been approved anyway—are at far less risk of death than from the flu. If authorities mandate vaccination of those who don’t need it, the public will start questioning vaccines in general."",

The law requires companies and organizations that collect personal data to make sure individuals give permission for their information to be used for a certain purpose, and to obtain permission again if their data will be used for any additional application. The U.K., which left the EU last year, still applies the bloc’s General Data Protection Regulation."", 
""In addition, Mr. Ustaran said that operators of coronavirus certificates would need to delete data when it is no longer valid, depending on how long immunity and vaccine protection lasts—which scientists still don’t know.

But some people aren’t willing or easily able to get vaccinated, and others won’t be able to get the shot for medical reasons, such as immune suppression. Another good weapon for the Covid arsenal would be a safe and effective drug that could be taken at home. Such outpatient drugs exist to prevent and treat the flu, and one public-health focus should be developing a Covid pill that could be taken after exposure, or soon after symptoms appear, to stop the infection from progressing."", 
""So far outpatient treatment options have been either therapeutic antibodies or repurposed medicines off the shelf. Antibodies, when given early, are very effective at preventing Covid hospitalizations and reducing the severity of symptoms. But they’re hard to administer outside a hospital setting, currently requiring time-consuming infusions. Manufacturers and public-health leaders should focus on research to make these infusions fast and easier, and to develop one-time shots that could also be used for prevention."", 
""A few repurposed drugs work, such as remdesivir and the steroid dexamethasone, which reduces the risk of death in patients who require oxygen or mechanical ventilation. More studies will help suss out the benefits of repurposed drugs, but so far many of these options have failed to show benefit in preventing mild Covid from progressing when studied in well-designed trials."", ""The National Institutes of Health should support further research for pills engineered to interrupt how the coronavirus replicates, which would be a hedge against mutations. Vaccines and antibody drugs work by targeting surface proteins on the virus. But the novel coronavirus can alter parts of these proteins through genetic mutation. What is concerning about the mutations in Brazil, South Africa, California and New York is that the virus figured out how to tweak an important region on its spike protein, one that is the target for many of the current vaccines and antibody-based therapies. Such mutations could render antibody drugs and vaccines less effective."", 
""Enter a pill. A small-molecule drug that could block some of the core machinery that the virus uses to replicate may be able to elude these mutations. That’s because it is often harder for the virus to change the process that it uses to infect cells and replicate. Such a treatment could be an important complement to vaccines and antibody drugs, including for the small percentage of patients who may get sick despite being vaccinated. A good drug may also prevent susceptible people from developing disease after a close contact with someone infected. Such a drug can be especially useful to prevent spread when an infection occurs in a household or congregate setting."",
