troubled Indian Health Service which cares for 26 million Native Americans could be addressed by taking some relatively straightforward steps according to IHS employees tribal members US lawmakers and outside healthcare experts A series of articles by The Wall Street Journal has identified numerous deficiencies at the federal agency including problem employees recruitment challenges and regulatory lapses The turmoil has sparked calls for changes The agency has chronic problems and it is underfunded and overwhelmed saidnnnnnnnnnn      n      Earl Pomeroynnnn      a former Democratic North Dakota congressman Nevertheless saidnnnnnnnnnn      n      James Bresettennnn      a former deputy director of the agencys clinicalservices arm theres definitely some lowhanging fruit that he believes the agency is capable of addressing The Journals reporting on the agency and new interviews with people who have faced the problems suggest several possible courses of action Congress has provided modest increases to the IHSs operating funding in recent years but that still leaves the agency far behind other federal health programs Medicare spends about three times as much per patient Were at Congresss whim in that regard the agencys acting directornnnnnnnnnn      n      Michael Weahkeennnn      said in a meeting with tribal leaders earlier this year Rear Adm Weahkee was nominated to become the agencys permanent leader in October The agencys leaders and federal overseers have stopped short of asking Congress for major new infusions during annual budget negotiations At a December Senate hearing on his nomination Adm Weahkee was asked if he would commit to advocating for more upfront funding for the IHS Doing so might set him at odds with his superiors in the Trump administration He declined to say he would seek more funding In a written statement the IHS said it works proactively within the administration and with the Congress to ensure the needs of Indian Country are fully understood The IHS which doesnt offer a full range of medical services at its hospitals is supposed to pay for patients to get additional necessary care from outside hospitals and doctors That funding falls short of what patients need according to the agencys own data and the IHS distributes it unequally In its Tucson Ariz region the IHS allocated about 8100 per uninsured patient in 2020 compared with around 1000 in its Oklahoma area a Journal analysis of 2017 agency data and budget records shows In the Great Plains region which includes the Rosebud Indian Health Service hospital in South Dakota the allocation is about 2200 per uninsured patient What should the federal government do to improve care at the Indian Health Service Join the conversation below The disparities result from an outdated allocation formula that doesnt take the needs of the patients into considerationand means that in lowspending areas common services are often denied At Rosebud orthopedic procedures such as knee replacements and diagnostic services like certain lung tests often dont get covered doctors said Its basically rationing saidnnnnnnnnnn      n      Douglas Lehmannnnnn      a former IHS doctor at Rosebud The agency could fix this saidnnnnnnnnnn      n      Ron Corneliusnnnn      a former Great Plains regional leader But with finite resources he said youd have winners and losers and so far nobody has taken that up The agency said one of its work groups recently recommended keeping the formula the same and that its ability to change it was limited Eight IHSrun hospitals with a combined 82 beds averaged less than one patient a night in 2018 according to IHS reports to federal regulators The agency could close seldomused inpatient wards located where there are other options and redirect the money including toward better primary care for patients with serious chronic health problems The agency said it might be appropriate to redirect resources from inpatient care to other services such as specialty medical treatment at some facilities where admissions have declined and that it would consult the tribes before making any decisions Parker Indian Health Center in a tiny Arizona town is about 15 miles from a private facility La Paz Regional Hospital La Pazs 22 beds were about onequarter full last year regulatory records show The IHS hospital with around 20 beds was only about 3 full the records show Neither facility delivers babies forcing women to travel at least 40 miles for that service according to the Arizona Center for Rural Health It doesnt make any sense to have two criticalaccess hospitals so close together but not other needed services saidnnnnnnnnnn      n      Daniel Derksennnnn      a University of Arizona professor and the centers director Kevin Brownnnnn      the chief executive of La Paz Regional declined to comment The Colorado River Indian Tribes which the Parker hospital serves said in a written statement the facility is underutilized due to operational issues such as a lack of staff and treatment decisions in which patients are released too soon The tribe said any reallocation of funding there would be a disservice to members that it would oppose Many IHS problems stem from difficulties recruiting qualified employees to its remote facilities The agency could fill gaps by working more closely with other healthcare providers and partners according to former employees and experts They operate so much in their own silo saidnnnnnnnnnn      n      Donald Warnennnn      an associate dean at the University of North Dakota who directs its program to draw more Native Americans into the heathcare field Doctors say the process of getting credentialed to see patients at an IHS facility even on a volunteer basis is cumbersome and flawed The Journal has reported that the agency hired doctors with histories including up to a dozen malpractice claims criminal convictions and sexabuse allegations They could streamline much of their administrative burden saidnnnnnnnnnn      n      Jeff Hostetternnnn      program director at the University of North Dakota Center for Family Medicine who for years has volunteered at an IHS hospital where he once was employed He said to keep working there he recently had to complete an application about four times as long as ones he has filled out for private hospitals The IHS said it has partnerships with several academic medical systems such as one with Massachusetts General Hospital that provides doctors to Rosebud The agency said it is expanding such partnerships The IHS needs to overcome a nonconfrontational culture that can lead it to defer dealing with personnel problems according to a report by the inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services The Journal and the PBS series Frontline reported in February that the agency shuffled a pediatrician suspected of molesting boys from one hospital to another instead of confronting the problem directly The doctornnnnnnnnnn      n      Stanley Patrick Webernnnn      has now been convicted of abusing six boys He is appealing IHS is more risk averse than anybody else when it comes to confronting personnel problems said Mr Bresette the former IHS official who also has worked in other agencies The IHS said it is working to better track such situations and that it is filling key positions with permanent leaders to ensure consistency and accountability In one recent case a clinic CEO namednnnnnnnnnn      n      Eyvonne Rekownnnn      was suspended with pay in August 2017 for alleged misconduct then relocated to a regional office for a spell records show She wasnt charged and has denied wrongdoing and was later assigned to work from home She was never given any duties She has collected her 80000plus annual salary ever since Ms Rekow remains in limbo She said How is this a good use of taxpayers money Write to Christopher Weaver at christopherweaverwsjcom and Anna Wilde

https//wwwwsjcom/articles/ustargetsmoreallegedhumanrightsabusers11577830885 The US has increased its use of sanctions as a tool to target alleged human rights abusers and corruption The number of sanctions imposed against alleged human rights abusers under programs implementing the US Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act reached an alltime high in 2019 due to a surge in designations in December There are at least 190 individuals and entities designated under the Global Magnitsky program according to data compiled by Dow Jones Risk  Compliance Ninetysix of them were issued in 2019 most during the week of Dec 9 when some countries commemorate efforts to promote human rights and fight corruption On Dec 9 which was International Anticorruption Day and Dec 10 which was Human Rights Day the US Treasury Department blacklisted 68 individuals and entities under the Global Magnitsky sanctions program The US Magnitsky Act named after Russian lawyernnnnnnnnnn      n      Sergei Magnitskynnnn      who died in a Moscow prison after accusing government officials of corruption was signed into law in 2012 and was intended to only target human rights abusers in Russia The

offenders beyond Russias borders Under the Global Magnitsky sanctions program alleged humanrights abusers face visa restrictions to enter the US and their US assets are blocked President Trump said in an executive order in December 2017 that serious human rights abuse and corruption across the globe constitute a threat to US national security Our Morning Risk Report features insights and news on

designations under the Global Magnitsky Act according to data from compliance software company Accuity Inc The actions targeted people and entities across Europe Asia Africa and Latin America The

overall number of sanctions levied by the USnot just those for human rightsjumped in the past three years as the Trump administration exerted economic pressure to pursue foreign policy objectives In 2019 the US blacklisted about 900 individuals and entities on top of more than 1450a recordduring the previous year according to data from Dow Jones Risk  Compliance  The Trump administration has designated more than 700 individuals and entities linked to corruption or human rights abuse under a variety of sanctions programs including the Global Magnitsky authorities according to a Treasury Department spokeswoman The US uses sanctions as a way to keep corrupt actors accountable she said and the Treasury Department typically releases sanctions designations as soon as they are ready The recently announced sanctions took months to put together and clear through the interagency and legal processes she said The Treasury Department decided to announce them on International Anticorruption Day and Human Rights Day If it is very important for the human rights community itd make sense for us to highlight them on specific days the spokeswoman said The Treasury Department blacklisted three North Korean officials for alleged human rights violations on the week of Human Rights Day in 2018 The political value of the Global Magnitsky Act is that it provides the US with a ready instrument to sanction perpetrators of serious human rights abuses quickly whenever a significant offense occurs saidnnnnnnnnnn      n      Vincent Gaudelnnnn      a compliance analyst at Accuity The US Treasury

https//wwwwsjcom/articles/hedgefundscouldmakeonepotentialfedrepomarketfixhardtostomach11578997801 One hurdle to a possible fix for recent volatility in the shortterm cash markets hedge funds Federal Reserve officials are considering a new tool to ease stresses in the market for Treasury repurchase agreements or repos Through the repo market banks and hedge funds borrow cash overnight while pledging safe securities such as government bonds as collateral In September an unexpected shortage of available cash to lend sparked a surge in the cost of repomarket borrowing prompting the Fed to intervene for the first time since the financial crisis One potential solution is to lend cash directly to smaller banks securities dealers and hedge funds through the repo markets clearinghouse the Fixed Income Clearing Corp or FICC Hedge funds currently borrow through a process called sponsored repo in which they ask a large bank to act as a middleman pairing their government bonds with moneymarket funds willing to lend cash The bank then guarantees that the parties will fulfill their obligationsrepaying the cash or returning the securities Firms trading through the FICC contribute to a fund that would cover a borrowers default Critics of the new plan say if the Fed lends cash directly through the clearinghouse it could end up contributing to a hedgefund bailout The Feds aim according to analysts is to step back from temporary efforts to quell repomarket volatility and increase financial reserves After Septembers volatility officials succeeded in suppressing yearend swings with temporary measures such as offering shortterm repo loans and buying Treasury bills Yet the new approach could also create political problems for policy makers analysts said The problem centers on the central bank lending directly to hedge funds the littleregulated investment vehicles that tend to serve wealthy or institutional investors The political backlash that followed crisisera bank rescues hangs over policy makers approach to the current problem analysts said even as officials work to ensure the smooth functioning of a key piece of the infrastructure underpinning financial markets Some fear that lending directly to hedge funds could lead to the perception the Fed is fueling risky bets How can the Fed best assess its strategy given the presence of hedge funds in the repo market Join the conversation below Theres a strong aversion to fat cat bailouts saidnnnnnnnnnn      n      Glenn Havliceknnnn      chief executive of GLMX which provides technology to repo trading desks Many hedge funds trade in the cash market through sponsored repos The clearinghouse sits between buyers and sellers to ensure that neither party backs out of the transaction Records of cleared trades also are publicly available improving the markets transparency The idea of using the clearinghouse appeals to some investors and analysts because the Fed has had trouble getting cash into the hands of the smaller banks securities dealers and investors who need it the most That is because the Fed trades exclusively with a small group of large banks and securities firms known as primary dealers Even among these firms activity is tightly concentrated A study recently published by the Bank for International Settlements said that liquidity in the repo market rests in the hands of the four largest banks in the US system Though hedge funds are key participants in the marketwhere they both borrow and lend cashlending to them directly through the FICC would raise questions about whether the government was backstopping their bets analysts said Hedge funds often use borrowed money to increase potential gains from investments but that strategy can also magnify losses Policy makers typically havent encouraged the use of levered investment strategies During the financial crisis many said bets using borrowed money worsened the downturn Some investors say the connections between firms involved with sponsored repos make the distinction between lending to one or the other meaningless Gang Hunnnn      a hedgefund manager at WinShore Capital Partners said he borrows cash in the repo market to increase the impact of his investments in Treasurybond futures and other interestrate products They are reluctant to provide a tool that would allow overall leverage to increase

https//wwwwsjcom/articles/whatweknowaboutthecoronavirus11579716128 Scientists and publichealth officials are learning more about the new coronavirus behind a continuing pandemic The disease it causes is called Covid19 We are updating our questions and answers regularly to keep up with their findings Here is what they know so far and how you can minimize your risk The virus infects both the upper and lower respiratory tract That means it is contagious and can cause pneumonia People who are infected initially develop a fever cough and aches and can progress to shortness of breath and complications from pneumonia according to case reports Of nearly 56000 patients in China 879 had a fever 677 had a dry cough 381 experienced fatigue and 186 had shortness of breath Other less common symptoms included sore throat headache aches chills repeated shaking with chills vomiting diarrhea and nasal congestion Some people report losing the senses of taste and smell  Some people become only mildly ill or are infected but dont get sick Others are mildly ill for a few days then rapidly develop more severe symptoms of pneumonia The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that people with severe symptoms should seek medical treatment immediately Those severe symptoms include  Difficulty in breathing or shortness of breath  Persistent pain or pressure in the chest  Bluish lips or face If you think you have been exposed and develop symptoms call your doctor Ask if you can be tested He or she will likely test you first for other respiratory infections such as the flu Isolate yourself from others and limit contact with pets as well Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough and sneeze Follow the same precautions you would to prevent infection washing hands regularly Wear a face mask if you have one when around others at home NL63 1100s SARS 2003 229E 1800s MERS 2012 OC43 1800s SARSCoV2 2020 HKU1 unknown Source Timothy Sheahan University of North Carolina Most people who are infected might become only mildly ill data suggest But mild can be anything from a fever cough and aches to pneumonia So for most people it is probably not just a few sniffles And mild or not youll have to be isolated or quarantined By not getting infected you would also protect those around you including older family members or anyone you know with heart disease or diabetes conditions that increase risk of severe illness Of 44672 cases in China 81 had mild symptoms 138 were severely ill and 47 were critically ill according to the Chinese CDC All of those who died were in critical condition Publichealth officials are trying to determine how many people have been infected including those who didnt get sick at all They are concerned and want to contain the virus because its effects arent fully known In addition new viruses can mutate possibly becoming more virulent as they work their way through a population The new coronavirus is spreading in many cities and as long as it is spreading at this rate there is a risk of getting it You may not show symptoms right away People become ill between two and 14 days after infection or in an average of about 5 days according to most estimates Experts say this is helpful for controlling symptoms which is the mainstay of treating the new coronavirus But it isnt a cure and wont prevent you from infecting others There have been reports that use of painkillers from a class known as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs containing ingredients like ibuprofen might worsen Covid19 infections Ibuprofen is known to reduce inflammation in the body that may be needed to fight an infection But the World Health Organization says it doesnt recommend against the use of ibuprofen The public health agency said it isnt aware of evidence on the topic or negative effects in patients from ibuprofen beyond the usual side effects It says it is consulting with physicians who are treating patients Yes there are diagnostic tests that you can get through a doctor or hospital which are the only way to confirm for certain whether a patient has the new coronavirus or another infection Hundreds of thousands of people have been tested in China and South Korea In the US testing was limited by problems with a CDCdeveloped test and narrow testing criteria Now more tests are being distributed and the CDC says doctors may decide whether a patient should be tested Blood tests are being developed and licensed to test people for antibodies to the virus to determine how many have been infected Some may not have gotten sick That test could also show whether people who did get sick are immune from reinfection If you are told to selfisolate you will need to stay at home and avoid contact with others for 14 days Try not to stay in the same room with others at the same time the UKs National Health Service recommends Stay in a wellventilated room with a window that can be opened Dont share towels utensils or dishes with others and wash them thoroughly after use Clean bathrooms and surfaces regularly Wash your hands before and after contact with pets Dont go out to public places ask family members or friends to get groceries medicines and other supplies for you Ask delivery people to leave items outside There arent any drugs or vaccines approved specifically for the new virus But more than three dozen are in development or being studied The first human testing ofnnnnnnnnnnn            Moderna Incsnnn      experimental vaccine against the virus has begun at the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle While this first part is starting early the estimate still is that testing of the vaccine will take a year to 18 months to complete A few other vaccine makers are developing products targeting the virus Two clinical trials in China and one in the US are evaluating remdesivir an antiviral drug fromnnnnnnnnnnn            Gilead Sciences Incnnn      that was also tested for Ebola A malaria drug hydroxychloroquine has gained attention as a possible treatment but there is no scientific evidence that it works experts say Schools workplaces and other public gathering places have been closed in many places and officials are recommendingand in some cases requiringthat people remain in their homes and away from exposure to other people while the coronavirus continues to spread Adults of all ages have been infected but the risk of severe disease and death is highest for older people and those with other health conditions such as heart disease chronic lung disease cancer and diabetes Most of the 1023 people whose deaths were included in a study by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention were age 60 or older and/or had other illnesses Many patients who have died were admitted to hospitals when their illness was advanced One large study in China found a mortality rate of 148 in people ages 80 and older and 8 in people ages 70 to 79 compared with a 23 mortality rate overall in the population studied Few children have been reported with the infection but that could change Of the children who were infected in China only a small proportion were severely ill according to the WHO While the disease is mild for teens and younger adults some have had severe illnesses and died Of 121 US patients admitted to an intensive care unit 12 were adults between the ages of 20 and 44 according to a study by the US CDC Covid19 has spread rapidly with cases identified in all 50 states and large outbreaks in some areas Federal state and local officials are taking unprecedented steps to try to minimize transmission such as banning large gatherings and imposing restrictions on movement Everyone in the US is being advised to adhere to these measures for their own safety and to protect others particularly those at highest risk The number of confirmed cases is substantially lower than the number of actual infections publichealth officials say because of a shortage of tests and because many people who get infected might not be sick enough to realize it Publichealth officials hope to flatten the curve of infections with the socialdistancing measures slowing the spread of the virus so that fewer people are infected Thats important to keep more people healthy and prevent hospitals from becoming too overwhelmed to care for all of the sick 2 1 Proteins on the outer shell of the virus allow it to latch onto cells in the hosts respiratory tract The proteins shapes are determined by the viruss genes

Sheahan University of North Carolina Alberto Cervantes and Josh Ulick /THE WALL STREET JOURNAL It transmits through respiratory droplets when an infected person speaks coughs or sneezes according to the WHO The droplets spread through the air and can land on another persons mouth or nose or possibly be inhaled into their lungs infecting them The droplets can also settle on nearby surfaces like a desk counter or doorknob where they can survive for a period A person can become infected by touching a contaminated surface then touching their mouth nose or eyes Respiratory droplets are heavy and dont travel far in the air so transmission is believed to occur mostly through close contact meaning within 6 feet of an infected person Scientists are also investigating whether the new coronavirus might spread through urine or feces Tests have found it in the digestive tract of some patients It can last up to 72 hours on plastic and stainless steel up to 24 hours on cardboard and four hours on copper according to a study in the New England Journal of Medicine by US government and academic scientists But it degrades quickly said Vincent Munster a virologist with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases who led the research The study also showed that the virus can survive in small droplets known as aerosols for about three hours though it disintegrates over time These droplets are small enough to remain suspended in the air for half an hour to an hour depending on air flow Dr Munster said Wipe down countertops doorknobs and other commonly touched surfaces frequently Regular household disinfectant wipes and cleaners kill the virus Health experts and mask makers say only a properly used reusable N95 respirator mask certified by an independent agency can guard fully against the virus Surgical masks and even cloth masks can provide some protection though The US CDC recommends that people wear cloth masks or face coveringseven a bandanna or scarf will doin public places like grocery stores where social distancing may be difficult Cloth masks or coverings dont fully protect wearers from becoming infected because they arent completely sealed on the face according to experts But they can help prevent people who are infected from spreading the virus by catching droplets emitted while exhaling coughing or sneezing They shouldnt be used on children under 2 years old or anyone who has trouble breathing the CDC says The CDC asks people to use nonmedical masks because supplies of masks are short and should be saved for healthcare workers and caregivers The most important thing you can do is wash your hands frequently for at least 20 seconds each time Wash them regularly when you are at the office when you come home before you eat and other times that you are touching surfaces You can also use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 alcohol Dont touch your eyes nose or mouthviruses can enter your body that way Wipe down objects and surfaces frequently with household cleaner which will kill the virus Maintain a distance from people who are sick Stay about 6 feet or more away from others Stock up on some supplies when recommended to stay home infectiousdisease experts say Items to consider include shelfstable foods like cans of beans packages of rice and pasta and beverages pain relievers and other common medications extra prescription medications and hygiene and cleaning products The State Department advises US citizens to avoid all travel abroad due to the global impact of Covid19 and has urged Americans currently abroad to return home immediately Citizens living abroad are also advised to avoid all international travel Those who are in countries where outbreaks are occurring should stay home as much as possible limit contact with others and follow guidelines from the CDC to prevent infection US authorities say The CDC American Red Cross and US Surgeon General are encouraging people to donate blood if they are able and healthy Social distancing does not have to mean social disengagement said Surgeon Generalnnnnnnnnnn      n      Jerome Adams To minimize risks of exposure to the new coronavirus the CDC has recommended that blood centers keep donor chairs 6 feet apart and encouraged people to make appointments ahead of time to minimize crowding This virus belongs to a family of viruses known as coronaviruses Named for the crownlike spikes on their surfaces they infect mostly bats pigs and small mammals But they mutate easily and can jump from animals to humans and from one human to another In recent years they have become a growing player in infectiousdisease outbreaks worldwide Seven strains are known to infect humans including this new virus causing illnesses in the respiratory tract Four of those strains cause common colds Two others by contrast rank among the deadliest of human infections severe acute respiratory syndrome or SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome or MERS This new virus is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 or SARSCoV2 The disease it causes is called Covid19 The number stands for 2019 the year it emerged The overall global mortality rate has ranged between 2 and over 4 according to calculations of confirmed cases and deaths worldwide which change daily But the true rate wont be known until epidemiologists can determine the denominator meaning how many people have actually been infected That number will include people who never had symptoms or had a flulike illness but never got a test for Covid19 The mortality rate has differed by region according to a report by an international mission of experts to China led by WHO The mortality rate was 58 in the first several weeks in Wuhan China where the epidemic originated But in other less hardhit areas of China which had more time to prepare to care for patients it was 07 The rate in China has come down over time the report said The overall mortality rate may be less than 1 US health officials suggested recently in the New England Journal of Medicine if the number of asymptomatic or mildly ill cases is several times greater than that of reported cases That is still much deadlier than seasonal flu which has a mortality rate of about 01 Covid19 appears to be less deadly than the related pathogenSARS which erupted in China in 2002 and

facial hair Sources BMC Infectious Diseases The Journal of Hospital Infection Research Lindsay Huth and Taylor Umlauf   Graphic Alberto Cervantes/THE WALL STREET JOURNAL Diseasemodeling experts have estimated that on average each infected person has transmitted the virus to about 26 others though the range is between 15 and 35 and one recent report put that number as high as 57 for the epidemic in China Those rates are higher than for some influenza viruses some are lower than for SARS and they are far lower than for measles in which one infected person can transmit the virus to 12 to 18 other people Publichealth experts caution that these estimates are preliminary change over time and can be lowered by measures to prevent the virus from spreading Experts are debating how easily the virus is transmitted The WHOled mission of experts who visited China reported that clusters of transmission occurred largely in families suggesting close contact Other outbreaks suggest more widespread patterns MOST COMMON EARLY SYMPTOMS Fever 98 Cough 76 Aches fatigue 44 HOW THE DISEASE PROGRESSED Avg days since onset of symptoms 7 8 9 105 days Admitted to hospital Acute respiratory distress No of patients 41 21 11 16 Admitted to intensive care unit Shortness of breath OUTCOMES Out of 41 patients 28 Discharged from hospital 7 Still hospitalized 6 Died As of Jan 22 roughly 20 days after coronavirus diagnoses confimed    Source The Lancet People become ill between two and 14 days after infection according to most estimates One report described a person who became ill 27 days after infection However a study by researchers at Johns Hopkins University found that the median incubation period is 51 days and 975 of those who develop symptoms will do so within 115 days That isnt yet known Sometimes a person is immune to a disease after an infection but not always Blood tests that reveal how many antibodies people who have recovered have will shed some light on the prospects for immunity Several studies have now shown that people who have no symptoms early symptoms or mild symptoms can transmit the virus to others Scientists say this type of transmission might be common and a possible explanation for why the virus spreads so quickly They are studying it further The CDC advises people to maintain a safe distance6 feet or morefrom others if Covid19 is spreading in their communities The new virus likely came originally from bats scientists say It isnt known exactly where or how it jumped to humans though Viruses from bats often infect another mammal first and then mutate to become more transmissible to humans One hypothesis is that the intermediary animal for this new virus may be a pangolin a small mammal sold in wildlife markets prized for its meat and scales covering its body Do you have questions about the risk of the new coronavirus from China Join the conversation below Health officials believe the outbreak originated in a large animal and seafood market in Wuhan China Of the first 41 cases 27 had some exposure to that market according to a report in the Lancet But three of the first four people to become ill on Dec 1 and Dec 10 said they had no contact with the market A study in the New England Journal of Medicine found that 55 of patients in Wuhan who became ill before Jan 1 had a link to the market compared with 86 of those who became ill after that point Scientists say it will take some time to identify the exact source While the virus has made some genetic changesas RNA viruses are prone to donone have made it deadlier or more contagious according to experts That is unlikely the CDC says Coronaviruses generally dont survive that long on inanimate surfaces according to the agency By submitting your response to this

specieshopping bat virus While Chinese authorities struggle to control the epidemic and restart their economy a world that has grown accustomed to contemplating Chinas inexorable rise was reminded that nothing not even Beijings power can be taken for granted We do not know how dangerous the new coronavirus will be There are signs that Chinese authorities are still trying to conceal the true scale of the problem but at this point the virus appears to be more contagious but considerably less deadly than the pathogens behind diseases such as Ebola or SARSthough some experts say SARS and coronavirus are about equally contagious Chinas initial response to the crisis was less than impressive The Wuhan government was secretive and selfserving national authorities responded vigorously but it currently appears ineffectively Chinas cities and factories are shutting down the virus continues to spread We can hope that authorities succeed in containing the epidemic and treating its victims but the performance to date has shaken confidence in the Chinese Communist Party at home and abroad Complaints in Beijing about the US refusing entry to noncitizens who recently spent time in China cannot hide the reality that the decisions that allowed the epidemic to spread as far and as fast as it did were all made in Wuhan and Beijing The likeliest economic consequence of the coronavirus epidemic forecasters expect will be a short and sharp fall in Chinese economic growth rates during the first quarter recovering as the disease fades The most important longerterm outcome would appear to be a strengthening of a trend for global companies to deSinicize their supply chains Add the continuing public health worries to the threat of new trade wars and supplychain diversification begins to look prudent Events like the coronavirus epidemic and its predecessorssuch as SARS Ebola and MERStest our systems and force us to think about the unthinkable If there were a disease as deadly as Ebola and as fastspreading as coronavirus how should the US respond What national and international systems need to be in place to minimize the chance of catastrophe on this scale Epidemics also lead us to think about geopolitical and economic hypotheticals We have seen financial markets shudder and commodity prices fall in the face of what hopefully will be a shortlived disturbance in Chinas economic growth What would happen ifperhaps in response to an epidemic but more likely following a massive financial collapseChinas economy were to suffer a long period of even slower growth What would be the impact of such developments on Chinas political stability on its attitude toward the rest of the world and to the global balance of power Chinas financial markets are probably more dangerous in the long run than Chinas wildlife markets Given the accumulated costs of decades of statedriven lending massive malfeasance by local officials in cahoots with local banks a towering property bubble and vast industrial overcapacity China is as ripe as a country can be for a massive economic correction Even a small initial shock could lead to a massive bonfire of the vanities as all the false values inflated expectations and misallocated assets implode If that comes it is far from clear that Chinas regulators and decision makers have the technical skills or the political authority to minimize the damageespecially since that would involve enormous losses to the wealth of the politically connected We cannot know when or even if a catastrophe of this scale will take place but students of geopolitics and international affairsnot to mention business leaders and investorsneed to bear in mind that Chinas power impressive as it is remains brittle A deadlier virus or a financialmarket contagion could transform Chinas economic and political outlook at any time Many now fear the coronavirus will become a global pandemic The consequences of a Chinese economic meltdown would travel with the same sweeping inexorability Commodity prices around the world would slump supply chains would break down and few financial institutions anywhere could escape the knockon consequences Recovery in China and elsewhere could be slow and the social and political effects could be dramatic If Beijings geopolitical footprint shrank as a result the global consequences might also be surprising Some would expect a return of unipolarity if the only possible greatpower rival to the US were to withdraw from the game Yet in the world of American politics isolation rather than engagement might surge to the fore If the China challenge fades many Americans are likely to assume that the US can safely reduce its global commitments So far the 21st century has been an age of

https//wwwwsjcom/articles/inwuhanchinasresidentialcommitteesfightoutbreakonfrontline11581717012 WUHAN ChinaLocal Communist Party representative Xiao Lifang has been working nearly nonstop since the outbreak of a deadly virus here helping to figure out who needs to be quarantined or hospitalized checking temperatures and delivering food and medicine to the thousands of residents she oversees Everything is dumped on the shequ she said using the Chinese word for community committee Were not doctors A legacy of the Mao era community committees serve as the governments neighborhood watchdogs carrying out Communist Party mandates resolving disputes and maintaining grassroots social order But they have been thrust to the front line of the fight against the coronavirus that has infected nearly 36000 in Wuhan and overwhelmed local officials and the healthcare system in this city of 11 million Ms Xiao and her team of nine workers have worked in shifts around the clock at a spartan office to assist 3700 people living in the Golden Dragon Garden residential complex They have comforted family members delivered vegetables arranged car rides and answered the constant phone calls from residents who need help On Friday she stood outside her office in a thick hooded kneelength coat and a surgical mask describing the worst moments of the outbreak This ear hurt she said pointing to her right side My arm didnt have enough strength to hold up the phone I had to charge my phone again and again Ms Xiao and her team have kept temperature records for all of the residents They have also made inperson visits to peoples apartments even as they were unsure if they themselves could get infected with the virus The virus has now infected more than 63000 people across China and killed at least 1380The majority of cases have been in Wuhans surrounding province of Hubei The number of documented infections in the province jumped by more than 18000 on Wednesday and Thursday after authorities adopted a broader diagnosis classification Straining to keep up the government has added thousands of beds by opening treatment centers and repurposing hotels as quarantine centers It has tasked community committees with categorizing and isolating residents in different facilities depending on the severity of their exposure No one should be left behind the provinces outbreak response team said last week after announcing the new policy Residents who didnt comply would face legal punishment it added without offering specifics Families have chafed at having overworked committee staff involved in making healthcare decisions At a different apartment complex in Wuhans Chezhan neighborhood the residential committee first decided to quarantine Zhu Qingmei at a hotel without medical care she said even though she was so sick that she had trouble breathing As the 55yearolds illness worsened and she was confirmed to have the virus Ms Zhu asked to be admitted to a hospital Her residential committee instead arranged for her to go to a convention center that had been turned into a field hospital for patients with milder symptoms Ms Zhu waited for hours at the back of a pickup truck at the field hospitals entrance before medical staff inside found out her blood oxygen levels were dangerously low and sent her to a hospital that specialized in ear nose and throat careShe spent two days there before finally being transferred to a hospital designated to treat the coronavirus It was like they just wanted to finish their task she said When I came out of the field hospital it was like I lost half my life I couldnt speak and breathing was difficult The Chezhan district committee which oversees Ms Zhus apartment complex declined a request for an interview A spokeswoman for the committee said some cases might have been mismanaged but only because officials were overwhelmed Health officials worry that the overburdened system is exposing healthy people to the virus Earlier this month one residential committee accidentally sent a confirmed case for quarantine to a hotel that was meant only for people who had been in close contact with virus patients A driver assigned by the committee who was wearing only a surgical mask for protection had picked up a mother who had been infected instead of her daughter who didnt have symptoms Its such a mess said Mr Xia a district health commission officer who was on duty at the hotel He declined to give his first name Its going to get others infected The city fired the director of one district committee for mismanaging dozens of critically ill patients according to the citys partyrun Changjiang Daily newspaper It reprimanded and gave a disciplinary warning to two others one of them for mistakenly sending severelyill patients to the wrong hospital Officials should make disease prevention the most important political task it said At the Golden Dragon community one resident took to the socialmedia platform Weibo to complain that the committee had refused to quarantine her and her husband who were both sick The virus isnt scary so much as peoples intentions she wrote Do you want to quarantine me or have me die The committee later arranged for the residents husband 44year old Xu Weijie to move to a hotel for monitoring and quarantine  VIEW In Depth While admitting to struggles community committees said they had assisted many in need There has been progress with nearly 1500 seriouslyill coronavirus patients getting admitted to hospitals in a matter of two days Wuhans former Communist Party secretary Ma Guoqiang said earlier this week Reinforcements have recently begun to arrive as the government brings in workers from stateowned enterprises and volunteers to help In Golden Dragon about 40 residents have come down with fevers since the outbreak began according to the community committee Roughly half had regular colds while another 10 were confirmed to have the virus that causes Covid19 and put in hospitals Nine other suspected cases were either put in hospitals or transferred to hotels for testing Ms Xiao said she started her job on the committee nearly two decades ago not long before China suffered an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome or SARS This outbreak has felt more serious she said Hubei registered only seven infections and one death from SARS in 2003 Get a curated weekly look at features columns and headlines on personal health and the health industry Sign up Ms Xiao the committees party secretary said she is in touch with every sick patient throughnnnnnnnnnnn            WeChatnnn      a popular Chinese app and her team rejoices each time an infected resident is able to secure a hospital bed Looking back she said shes not sure how she and her team got through the previous weeks Trying to contain the outbreak has been grueling and terrifying according to Ms Xiao who said she typically doesnt get home until midnightAfter walking in the door she sprays her clothes down with alcohol and takes a shower worried shell bring the virus back to her family She said she has noticed a change among residents recently There is less fear and the discussions in the WeChat group are starting to return to the mundane topics of everyday life like how to bake cakes and cook pizza Still she feels the battle against the virus is far from over Im scared to be optimistic she said Kersten Zhang contributed to this article Write to Chao Deng at ChaoDengwsjcom Copyright 2020 Dow Jones  Company Inc All Rights Reserved

researchanddevelopment spending on artificial intelligence and quantum information sciences citing fierce global competition while cutting overall funding for RD The proposal is part of President Trumps 48 trillion federal budget for the fiscal year ending in September 2021 A White House budget isnt binding it signals an administrations areas of focus for congressional budget negotiations in the year ahead Under the proposal the governments overall RD spending would decline to 1422 billion from an estimated 156 billion in fiscal 2020 according to a White House budget document  Within the next two years annual spending on AI would rise to more than 2 billion and funding for quantum computing would increase to 860 million according to the White House plan The proposed increases in AI spending include more than 850 million at the National Science Foundation 125 million at the Department of Energys Office of Science and 100 million at the Agriculture Department among other agencies The budget also proposes 50 million in AI and quantum education and job training initiatives including partnerships with community colleges Earlystage research is a high priority Kelvin Droegemeier

Cinnamon Rogers executive vice president for public policy at tech trade group CompTIA said the federal spending proposals on AI and quantum computing show the administration is serious about competing with China and other countries Doubling down on investments in artificial intelligence and computing RD is important for innovation and the economy Ms Rogers said The Center for Data Innovation a nonpartisan research institute said in a report last year that China is adopting AI at a faster rate than both the US and the European Union due in part to government spending The Trump administration last year committed nearly 1 billion toward AI research citing a need to maintain a competitive edge in emerging technology President Trump in 2017 signed into law a bill authorizing spending 12 billion over five years toward establishing a National Quantum Initiative aimed at accelerating RD across the federal government Investing in US computingtechnology startups in the private

three Wall Street Journal reporters over a headline Yes a headline Or at least that was the official justification The truth is that Beijings rulers are punishing our reporters so they can change the subject from the Chinese publics anger about the governments management of the coronavirus scourge China Is the Real Sick Man of Asia was the headline overnnnnnnnnnn      n      Walter Russell Meadsnnnn      Feb 3 column in the Journal Mr Mead a fellow at the Hudson Institute writes a weekly column on foreign affairs for us He did not write the headline Anyone who reads the piece can see it describes the problems in Chinese governance exposed by the response to the coronavirus outbreak Beijing has since sacked Wuhan province officials proving Mr Meads point As for that headline we have heard from thoughtful people that to Chinese ears the sick man reference echoes in insensitive fashion the Wests exploitation of China in the mid19th century during the opium wars Others say it refers to Japans 20thcentury invasion of China We take the point and we were happy to run letters to the editor criticizing the headline Most Americans however understand the phrase in the context of the dying Ottoman Empire as the sick man of Europe That was our historical analogy These days the sick man phrase is used to describe many countries most notably the Philippines as the sick man of Asia The Financial Times the Economist and the Guardian all referred to Britain as the sick man of Europe in the throes of Brexit The Global Times a publication that expresses Chinese government views republished a Reuters article in 2016 whose lead sentence referred to Egypt as the sick man of the Middle East In 2011 Foreign Affairs used the headline The Sick Man of Asia Chinas Health Crisis over an article bynnnnnnnnnn      n      Yanzhong Huangnnnn      a professor who grew up in China and graduated from Fudan University In any event Mr Meads column and headline were never published in China Thats because the Journal is banned there Our website has been shut down since 2014 Our reporters can cover China for the rest of the world but not for Chinese readers That didnt stop the Chinese government from starting a public campaign against the headline A Foreign Ministry spokesman denounced the column and several Chinese propaganda organs spread the same theme Racism worse enemy than epidemic read a headline in Xinhua lumping Mr Meads article with one from Der Spiegel Our email inbox was soon flooded with complaints about the headline all containing remarkably similar language and demanding an apology A campaign was orchestrated to get Mr Mead barred fromnnnnnnnnnnn            Twitternnn      If you think this was spontaneous outrage you dont understand how Chinas government works to influence public opinion at home and abroad Beijing knows how to exploit Americas identity politics to charge racism in service of its censorship And now China has escalated to ban our three reporters who had nothing to do with the headline or Mr Meads column As our readers know and as we have explained to Chinese officials for years our news and opinion departments are run independently and have separate reporting lines to the publisher Election 2020 and the Future of American Politics Join WSJ Opinions Paul Gigot and Kimberley Strassel with guests Marie Harf and Karl Rove as they discuss the upcoming election at the Perot Museum of Nature and Science in Dallas on Tuesday April 14 at 7 pm Sign up here The Chinese understand this but choose to ignore it when it suits their propaganda purposes In August they refused to renew the press credentials of a Journal reporter who wrote about the business interests of Mr Xis cousin in Australia This week the excuse for expulsion is an opinion headline Soon enough it might be a news story about Chinas internment camps for Uighurs in Xinjiang or an editorial about Hong Kong What Chinese officials dont understand is that a free press would have helped them better cope with the virus fallout Democracies are resilient because a free media sends signals and information that allow an outlet for grievances and alert leaders to problems before they become crises The Chinese also dont seem to understand that their bullying reduces the shrinking number of allies they still have in the US These columns have supported Chinas overall trading relationship with the US even as we criticize some of its trading practices In the days before Mr Meads column we ran an editorial Wuhan Wilbur Ross criticizing the US Commerce Secretary for saying the coronavirus would be an economic benefit for the US Mr Rosss point of view will find more American support the more China steals American secrets and banishes reporters Chinas expulsions are so extreme that they surely have more to do with its domestic politics than American opinion Perhaps they are also in part a response to the State Departments decision Tuesday to identify the US operations of staterun Chinese media as foreign missions which subjects them to the same restrictions as embassies The coronavirus is a seismic political event that undermines Mr Xis promise to his citizens about a rising China and the competence of the Communist Party The governments default defense is to play the nationalist card and blame foreigners for its homegrown troubles Thats why it censors public complaints on Chinese social media gins up a furor over a headlineand banishes the best reporters in the world from covering China Copyright 2020 Dow Jones  Company Inc All

impact of the outbreak on their own enterprises Just as scientists are confronting an unknown enemy corporate executives are largely working blind because the coronavirus could cause supplychain disruptions that are unlike anything we have seen in the past 70 years For now the best course of action for companies is to analyze possible outcomes in the context of known supplychain risks based on historical precedents and to take precautionary measures that minimize exposure to future disruptions Predictions regarding the impact of the virus range from dire to optimistic Pessimists draw parallels with the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic which killed tens of millions of people worldwide and the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis On the other side optimists foresee an epidemic akin to a typical flu outbreak that will run its course Top news and indepth analysis on the world of logistics from supply chain to transport and technology From a supplychain perspective the disruptions associated with past crises such as the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome or SARS that swept across Asia the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster or the 2011 Thailand floods are not a good yardstick for the current epidemic Those events shook specific companies for a relatively short time but the impact of the coronavirus could be much more sustained Moreover the virus formally known as Covid19 is affecting both supply and demand so the potential threats are graver than those earlier disruptions This is especially true because of Chinas growth since the SARS crisis as a manufacturing powerhouse and as a major consumer market Todays supply chains are global and more complex than they were in 2003 Not only are Chinese factories affected by lockdowns and quarantines production sites in other countries already are running low on parts for products assembled in China For examplennnnnnnnnnn            Apple Incnnn      works with suppliers in 43 countries all of which receive components from Apples contract manufacturers in China To understand which companies in supply chains are the most vulnerable one has to understand the socalled supplychain bullwhip effect n        The most vulnerable companies are small and leveraged suppliers upstream in the supply chain that are in danger of going undern         Assume for instance that a retailer experiences an X drop in demand for a product It surmises that future sales will be lower too and so concludes that its current inventories are too high So the retailer cuts its orders to the wholesaler by twice the amount of the drop in demand The wholesaler sees that cut in its orders and using the same logic cuts the orders to the manufacturer by double that amount or four times less than the retailers drop in demand The manufacturer reduces its orders to parts suppliers by even more and so on At each level of the supply chain the decline in demand sparks a bigger decline in orders from suppliers Each company reasons that they need to quickly cut production to adjust to declining sales and work off their nowbloated inventory The most vulnerable companies are small and leveraged suppliers upstream in the supply chain that are in danger of going under ThenFord Motor Co Chief Executivennnnnnnnnn      n      Alan Mulallynnnn      tried to mitigate the impending bullwhip during the 2008 financial crisis by imploring US lawmakers to save his competitors He argued that if automotive Tier 1 suppliers failed then their suppliers would also fail and so on affecting the entire US automobile industry When demand revives the bullwhip pattern reverses as each echelon boosts ordering both to cover expected higher sales and to quickly replenish depleted inventories The reverse bullwhip of oscillating orders and inventories strains the ability of production and logistics operations to keep up After a period during which many upstream suppliers fail and remaining companies fail to deliver during the recovery a multinational enterprise may find it easier to leave China and set up manufacturing elsewhere Faced with so many unknowns companies should take sensible just in case steps to prepare for the effects of the coronavirus 1 Set up a central emergency management center At this point it can be virtual but should include a clear roster of participants with clear decisionmaking rules in case of a pandemic 2 Review the companys product portfolio and the customer base in order to set priorities If capacity is reduced there will need to be rules for which products should be built and which customers should be supplied first 3 Review suppliers Who makes critical parts Are there alternate sources What is the suppliers inventory status 4 Plan for operating to maximize cash flow rather than profits 5 Maintain communications with federal and local authorities as well as Chinese and other Southeast Asian friends and colleagues on the ground Hoping for the best while preparing for the worst

kitsare locked in fierce competition To make their wares more appealing to customers some companies are executing a counterintuitive twist on that strategy They are making it easy to quit ClassPass Inc which has a monthly subscription service that gives users access to exercise classes at a variety of gyms and studios is phasing out a livechat feature that customers have had to contend with when they cancel The chat was partly designed to encourage customers to find a better plan that they might not have been aware of before signing off for good according tonnnnnnnnnn      n      Lauren Cowhernnnn      Hill director of global customer experience at ClassPass But the company is rolling out technology to automate its cancellation process Ms Cowher Hill said with the goal of making it available to all global consumers in the coming months We know the ability to pause or make changes to a membership is something our members deeply value Ms Cowher Hill said And this isnt just true for ClassPass Globally there is a growing desire for a frictionless cancellation flow especially for subscription services and were proud to be making strides to deliver that  ClassPass is using what it learned from the live chat process to inform its automated cancellation system she said Many companies have used onerous policies and processes to keep customers past trial periods and discourage them from canceling later according to Robbie Kellman Baxter a consultant specializing in membership models and subscription pricing and author of a forthcoming book The Forever Transaction How to Build a Subscription Model So Compelling Your Customers Will Never Want to Leave But that isnt a winning longterm strategy she said If youre trying to have a longterm relationship with your customer and youre kind of sneaky with the terms youre not going to be generating trust Ms Baxter said Some companies have also been called out for difficult cancellation rules The Honest Co a consumergoods company cofounded by actressnnnnnnnnnn      n      Jessica Albannnn      was criticized in 2016 for making subscribers call on the phone before they could cancel It changed its policy that December to allow cancellation online Last year Rent the Runway began letting subscribers to its fashion service immediately pause or cancel memberships by sending a single email It previously required members to call or email a Membership Concierge which had drawn complaints for sometimes replying slowly The company made the change to make things easier for members but a representative noted another benefit as well It lightened inbound calls to the customer service team Easy cancellation policies could actually help businesses lure in more subscribers and encourage more customers to come back if they have left said Peter Fader a professor of marketing at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania Such policies he says make the subscription experience more personal by making customers feel fairly treated That could help the subscription companies broader efforts to make recurring shipments and automatic charges feel less transactional and more like membership in a club Harrys Inc the subscription razor service that also sells products in retail stores last May launched what it describes as a core membership program that costs 15 a year giving customers discounts when they shop online as well as free engravings and access to limitededition products It started the program because customer feedback indicated a desire for specialized services according tonnnnnnnnnn      n      Kalpana Gantinnnn      head of digital product at Harrys The company has converted 57 of subscribers to its basic monthly plan to the new membership program Ms Ganti said Harrys said customers can cancel either through Harryscomby clicking a button on their profileor by getting in touch with the customer support team via phone or email Personalized services and other membership touches help companies connect with customers who are increasingly subscribing instead of making individual purchases saidnnnnnnnnnn      n      Tien Tzuonnnn      founder and CEO of Zuora Inc a provider of

Making quitting simple could even become the law A 2018 California regulation began requiring companies that let consumers subscribe online to also let them opt out online We think this is a precursor to more consumer protections to come saidnnnnnnnnnn      n      Guy Marionnnnn      chief executive officer and cofounder at Brightback Inc which offers automated customer retention software for

patients who want to come in because of fears they might be infected by the novel coronavirus Try the phone first Doctor groups hospitals and health insurers are increasingly steering people with mild or no symptoms toward initial visits conducted by phone interactive video or secure messaging They are also starting to use the technology to care remotely for people with suspected or confirmed cases of Covid19 the respiratory disease caused by the virus The number of coronavirus cases in the US crossed 100 Tuesday with a growing outbreak in Washington and new cases scattered across states from New York to Arizona As the fastmoving virus spreads hospitals and doctors say they fear a surge of patients into waiting rooms could further spread the disease If a patient is potentially infected we dont want them coming into a doctors office or urgent care or emergency room to sit in a waiting room and potentially infect other patients said Robert Wyllie chief of medical operations at the Cleveland Clinic The Cleveland Clinic is suggesting that patients call  setting up a video visit with a doctor who can decide whether the patient needs to come in for an examination Hospitals are also seeking to conserve beds for the sickest patients should a large outbreak occur Critically ill coronavirus cases could stress the capacity of hospitals infectiousdisease experts say In the Seattle area where a nursing home is at the epicenter of new cases officials announced plans to buy a hotel to house Covid19 patients as they recover We want to do everything we can so that only people with severe illness are going to the hospital said Jenna MandelRicci who is heading emergency preparations for the Greater New York Hospital Association a trade group The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has urged doctors and hospitals to first assess potentially infected patients remotely The agency is also suggesting that patients with mild symptoms from Covid19 can be cared for at home when possible but monitored closely using virtual checkins Companies that provide telehealth services say they have seen an uptick in recent days The evidence of community spread that was a big gamechanger said Ian Tong chief medical officer of Doctor on Demand Inc a telemedicine company People are on high alert American Well Corp which offers doctor visits primarily by video had seen an 11 higherthanexpected volume leading into Monday and expects further growth said Peter Antall chief medical officer Part of the increase is from people worried about Covid19 but the surge was also driven by patients with other conditions seeking to avoid being exposed American Well has had two patients who met CDC guidelines for testing and it referred them to hospitals Dr Antall said Monday The company reaches out to let the hospitals know of patients arrival and tells patients to remain in their cars until hospital personnel meet them he said It also makes sure local publichealth officials are contacted and follows up to make sure the patients got treated It would be irresponsible for us to just send patients off and say go to your local emergency room Dr Antall said Providencewhich operates eight hospitals in the Seattle areaplans to start steering patients initially using a chatbot a computer program designed to take questions and provide answers The system which operates 51 hospitals and 1000 clinics across seven states consulted CDC guidelines and its own doctors about criteria by which patients should be triaged to nurses said Todd Czartoski telehealth chief executive for Providence We literally spent 48 hours going back and forth about where do you draw the line he said The chatbot built inhouse two years ago will be found online on a Providence webpage for Covid19 information Anyone with clear exposuresuch as contact with someone potentially infected or having made recent travel in areas with outbreakswill be directed to call Providence nurses Dr Czartoski said The chatbot will also steer those with flulike symptoms and trouble breathing to nurses as well as those with mild symptoms who are at higher risk such as seniors or those with heart disease Kaiser Permanente the big integrated healthcare provider and insurer based in California says it is using telehealth to care for members who are quarantining at home Patients are staying in touch with doctors via video phone and textstyle messaging said Patrick Courneya Kaiser Permanentes chief medical officer The ability to stay connected with people remotely and follow them over time is very powerful said Dr Courneya Kaiser is also issuing laptops to more doctors who can do visits from home during late hours or should they be isolated due to potential infection he said Intermountain Healthcare a large Utah hospital system is using video visits for a coronavirusinfected patient who is in one of its hospitals The patient who was a passenger on the cruise ship Diamond Princess is in an isolated room where nurses care for him in person but doctors see him via a live video feed said Todd Vento medical director for Intermountains infectiousdisease telehealth program You can get a really good assessment through the camera said Dr Vento who said the technology allows him to zoom in if needed The patient currently has no symptoms of Covid19 he said Telehealth services have grown rapidly in recent years A 2019 Kaiser Family Foundation survey found 82 of big employers included such a service in their biggest health plan up from 27 in 2015 But the services havent always proved popular A Kaiser foundation analysis of 2016 data found uptake by consumers was low Telehealth providers are lobbying for Congress to include in coronavirusrelated legislation a

pulled her car to the side of the road She was on the verge of a breakdown Shed been working nonstop for daysat the center of Chinas coronavirus outbreak where she is a doctor Both of her parents had Covid19 the disease caused by the virus as did many of her colleagues The number of sick and dying was climbing And on this day Dr Zhang had forgotten about her 9yearold daughter who was home alone and scaredand who at that moment wasnt picking up the phone Dr Zhangs eyes welled up but she had no energy to cry My tears wouldnt flow she said in an interview on Feb 18 Around the world doctors are being stretched to the limit Short on supplies and sleep theyre being asked to stop a global pandemic that no one fully understands Adding to that strain theyre risking their own health while they diagnose cases and attend to sick patientsalong with the health of their spouses children and other close family members With the virus now growing more quickly outside China than inside its a problem other countries will increasingly face In China more than3000 doctors have been infected according to official data and at least 22 have died Some medical professionals believe the numbers are even higher adding uncertainty for doctors elsewhere confronting the virusUntold numbers of family members have fallen ill Chinese doctors are working shifts of 10 hours or more Many stay in the same hazmat suits the entire time without food water or bathroom breaks Disrobing to eat or go to the bathroom could risk exposure Medical workers are requesting psychological help to try to deal with the stress Infectiousdisease doctors around the world are trained to handle highly contagious illnesses and know the risks But the current outbreak is spreading so quickly that its forcing hospitals to deploy staff with limited experience in infectious diseases and sometimes insufficient gear to keep them safe Some hospitals cant find enough staff willing to take on the risk In South Korea some nurses and support staff quit when the outbreak spread their families begging them to resign Iran has faced equipment shortages while its deputy health ministerhimself a surgeonhas been infected with the virus Doctors in China say conditions have improved significantly since the early days of the outbreak Roughly 42000 medical staff from around the country have descended upon Wuhan and the surrounding Hubei province to provide relief That includes around 4000military doctors in one of Chinas largestever mobilizations of military medical resources Wuhan has 53000 beds in hospitals and temporary medical and quarantine facilities for treating patients with the coronavirus with a goal of adding 17000 more according to an official media briefing on Feb 20 Crowds and lines at fever

Chinese ophthalmologist turned folk hero who died after warning about the dangers of the virus was in his early 30s Both doctors wives were pregnant Dr Zhang who worried about her 9yearold daughter and sick parents was more prepared for the crisis than most A radiologist at Zhongnan Hospital a 3300bed facility overlooking a lake in central Wuhan she had served on the front lines of SARS in 2003 as well as after Chinas deadly Sichuan earthquake in 2008 On Dec 31 Dr Zhang was on her first day of vacation and planning to take a trip with her parents and daughter to their hometown in Inner Mongolia That morning her superiors called ordering her to attend an emergency meeting Two patients at Zhongnan had lung infections reminiscent of SARS Word was spreading among staff that a mysterious illness was sweeping through a seafood market on the west side of town At the meeting hospital officials issued new guidelines for staff to disinfect their spaces unlock windows to ensure circulation of fresh air and begin wearing goggles and other protection in some areas Dr Zhangs colleagues had asked her to consult on the two patients Xrays and she was worried about what she saw She warned colleagues that if a virus had spread from animals to humans then humantohuman transmission would be easy She also spoke to the hospitals Communist Party secretary to explain her fear of another epidemic Some people thought she was being alarmist she says With the hospital short on supplies Dr Zhang made homemade masks out of gauze for her parents and daughter just like shed learned to do during SARS The family canceled their holiday A few days later a technician in the imaging department discovered he had been infected Sick patients began pouring in Soon dozens of staff were sick at Zhongnan and other Wuhan hospitals as well Most days Dr Zhang reviewed chest Xrays a relatively lowrisk job Some days shed don a hazmat suit and tend to patients herself Worried she might bring the virus back home and overloaded with work she began sleeping on an office sofa She barely had time to eat and shower She figured her parents who lived in her home could take care of her daughter Her husbandwas living and working hundreds of miles away and unable to join them afterauthorities announced a strict quarantine of Wuhan in late January Then Dr Zhangs 69yearold mother admitted to feeling sick Dr Zhang convinced her parents to get tested for the virus For her mothers first visit to the hospital Dr Zhang had her meet nearby so her mother could put on protective gear before going in Both parents came up negative using the nucleic acid test a finicky diagnostic tool test that regularly produced false negativesTheir CT scans told a different story When I saw it I knew Dr Zhang said recalling her mothers first chest scan My heart sank Her father who had been reluctant to get tested had a lung infection that turned out to be even worse though he showed no obvious symptoms at the time All along the family worried about the youngest member Dr Zhangs daughter Dr Zhang had been too scared to check her daughter until the girl volunteered Scan me Itll be OK she said Her lungs were normal Still Dr Zhang was facing a crisis Her husband was away her parents were sick and contagious and she was needed at the hospital There was no one to take care of her daughter whose school was closed Dr Zhang planted her in the familys living room with instructions to look after herselfand to stay away from her grandparents who quarantined themselves in other rooms The 9yearold learned how to heat up canned congee placing it at each grandparents door As her parents conditions worsened Dr Zhang struggled to get them admitted to a hospital Beds were limited and authorities were unwilling to make arrangements for people whose nucleic acid tests had come back negative With help from a colleague Dr Zhang got hold of some medicine including antiretroviral medication for HIV that researchers are testing as a treatment for the coronavirus Her parents suffered side effects including nausea Then 10 quarantine spots opened up for family of Zhongnan Hospital staff in an empty building slated for demolition Dr Zhang raced to grab a number to reserve a spot while a colleague ran to guard two beds inside The new location wasnt designed to provide any medical treatment but getting a room for her parents was a relief for Dr Zhang Although authorities had publicly announced there were no more beds there scores of people had gathered there anyway desperate to get space Some people were clutching their stomach others holding their heads and others coughing uncontrollably said Dr Zhang Her heart broke After the chaos that day she suddenly remembered her daughter back home She tried calling and pulled over her car She was overwhelmed with feelings of guilt and hopelessness It took a moment for her to calm herself down She told herself It would be a disaster for the family if I couldnt pull it together Arriving home Dr Zhang pushed open the door to find the lights out In a panic she called out for her daughter A faint voice replied from the dark as her daughter stirred from a nap She had been hungry without food at home and had little energy to do anything but lie down and sleep Her daughter ate the meal her mother had brought pleading for things to be different She asked why her mother had to be at work all the time I was afraid to be alone at home today Dr Zhangs daughter told her Dr Zhang felt terrible but tried to coax her daughter to understand You need to grow up she said If you dont grow up Mom will be even more worried Whats the best way to support healthcare workers Join the conversation below Eventually her daughter said Mom is so strong Ill be too though she admitted she was still scared Dr Zhang tucked her daughter in for the night letting her watch cartoons from her bed Dr Zhang knew then she needed to find some way for her husband to join her in Wuhan The couple applied for special permission from the government two days later he got approval to drivetheroughly14hour journey into the city On Feb 3 Dr Zhang took to her social messaging account to call for the use of chest Xrays in diagnosing Covid19 instead of lab tests that were resulting in so many false negatives She raised the alarm on crossinfection within families recommending the government make use of hotels and school dormitories to quarantine suspected cases Speaking up was no small risk for Dr Zhang who went back and forth overwhether to post the night before Even Dr Zhangs friends were worried about her post she said Authorities had detained people for speaking up about the outbreak in its early days The next day Chinas National Health Commission incorporated the use of chest scans in diagnoses in Hubei province Days later authorities reclassified more than 13000 suspected instances of the virus as confirmed cases That meant many more patients could have a better chance of access to treatment including hospital beds and quarantine locations as they opened up Friends sent screenshots of the good news to Dr Zhang She worried about a shortage of CT scanners and called up manufacturers that could produce portable machines She helped coordinate with staff at other facilities to ensure they had enough equipment and technicians For Dr Zhang the outbreak has felt neverending Her hospital oversees three separate coronavirus facilities with 5400 beds At its own campus Zhongnan worked to add 2000 new beds up from a few hundredfor coronavirus patientspreviously With their offices being repurposed for patients Dr Zhang and her colleagues moved into a hotel where they work and sleep Dr Zhang believes it will take months for hospitals to work through all theinfected patients Letting down their guard could lead to a resurgence in cases One night Dr Zhang returned to her hotel carrying half a dozen lunch boxes for her colleagues She says her back felt like it would split in two and she had developed a persistent cough A hotel security guard checked Dr Zhangs temperature and asked her to log what time she entered the building She had completely lost track of time Im fine she said as the guard raised a thermometer to her forehead It was normal If we fail what happens to you all she said walking away

startlingly higher than the average for people age 60 and over as well as for people with high blood pressure diabetes asthma and other chronic conditions In one large study by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention 148 of people 80 and older and 8 of people 70 to 79 died For people with cardiovascular disease the mortality rate was 105 and 73 for those with diabetes Those rates

Americans 65 and over rose 27 between 2011 and 2018 to 524 million according to the US Census Bureau while the under65 cohort grew 2 Older Americans make up 16 of the US population About 46 of American adults have high blood pressure according to guidelines by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association About 342 million people or 105 of the US population have diabetes according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Chinas statistics are from the early weeks of an explosive epidemic in which hospitals were overwhelmed and doctors struggled to figure out how best to care for patients struck with a new disease Death rates in lesshardhit parts of China have been lower and have come down for the whole country over time according to the World Health Organization Precise death rates are also unclear because it isnt known how many people have actually been infected Many have either not been ill enough to suspect they had the disease or havent had access to a test Still the data show that people with aging or taxed immune systems have a far more difficult time fighting off Covid19 the respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus Its very clear that this virus has greater mortality and morbidity in older individuals and those with chronic conditions says Mark Mulligan director of NYU Langone Healths division of infectious diseases and immunology in New York Morbidity is the rate of a diseases presence in a population Older people are generally at higher risk of becoming severely ill from infectious diseases such as the flu Dr Mulligan notes As people age the immune system undergoes immunosenescence gradually losing its ability to mount a response to an infection as robustly as it once did Precisely how that happens is an active subject of study Among the changes the thymus an organ of the immune system shrinks starting at young adulthood Tcells soldiers of the immune system which mature in the thymus lose some of their function Deaths by age group as of March 11 US South Korea Under 10 Under 10 1019 1019 2029 2029 3039 3039 4049 4049 5059 5059 6069 6069 7079 7079 80 80 Unknown Deaths by age group as of

often dont develop high fevers as a resultand a temperature not regularly recognized as a serious fever may be missed or mistaken for another problem says XinQi Dong director of the Institute for Health Health Care Policy and Aging Research at Rutgers University Thus says Dr Dong 1005 may be a true fever possibly indicating the presence of Covid19 Lung function also declines with age making respiratory diseases a particularly serious threat for older people he says Older people are more likely to have serious underlying conditions that also put themand younger peopleat risk of complications from Covid19 Cardiovascular disease diabetes and lung diseases all tax the body making infections harder to fight off says Bruce Ribner director of Emory University School of Medicines Serious Communicable Diseases Unit The system is just not able to put up with that much of an assault he says High blood glucose impairs the ability of white blood cells to fight infections in people with diabetes Dr Ribner says Viruses can settle more easily into people whose lungs are impaired from a lung disease he says Scientists say they are trying to learn more about the apparent link seen in China between severe Covid19 and high blood pressure People with cardiovascular disease often have lung diseases too and generally are more susceptible to flu and viral pneumonia experts say Covid19 has already exacted a heavy toll on older sicker Americans claiming at least 22 lives in one nursing home in a Seattlearea outbreak that public health officials are struggling to contain Health officials say Italys aging population is a big reason behind the large outbreak and high current death rate of 5 in that country Death rates for some older people have also been higher than they are for the overall population in a large outbreak in South Korea Italy and China have higher smoking rates which may be a factor in their high death rates among older adults says Marc Lipsitch professor of epidemiology at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health and director of the Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics Dr Lipsitch says he expects mortality rates to be higher for vulnerable people than for the overall population in the US though how much higher is hard to tell US health officials have urged Americans who are vulnerable to limit travel and avoid large crowds The risks to such people are considerable saysnnnnnnnnnn      n      Anthony Faucinnnn      director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases If you are a person with an underlying condition and you are particularly an elderly person with an underlying condition you need to think twice about getting on a plane on a long trip Dr Fauci said on NBCs Meet the Press this week And not only think twice just dont get on a cruise ship The US government has urged nursing homes to restrict visitor access to reduce the risk of spread People at higher risk should heed the same precautions that exist for everyonewash hands regularly stay away from sick people and keep uptodate on vaccines for flu and pneumonia the US CDC and infectiousdisease experts say They should avoid large gatherings limit close contact with others when out in public and stay home as much as possible to reduce risk of exposure according to the US That likely means no church or theater For now do not congregate in places with a lot of people Dr Dong says I would not go to bingo parlors But a bridge game with a few trusted friendswho arent sickis OK he says Its important to stay socially connected even if physical connection is limited Connecting by phone or video with older relatives who are alone is a good idea he says Social isolation has been linked to adverse health outcomes Dr Dong says

Street Journal","https://www.wsj.com","www.wsj.com","c https//wwwwsjcom/articles/thecoronavirusandyourjobcanmybossmakemedothat11583981316 The new coronaviruss spread is taking the relationship between employers and their workers into new territoryone in which both sides are trying to sort out their rights and responsibilities in containing the outbreak Caught between trying to keep the virus out of their workplaces and minimizing business disruptions employers are issuing all sorts of edicts unthinkable just weeks ago from worker quarantines to officewide remote work and even personaltravel reporting requirements Many employees meanwhile are wondering just how far their bosses have to go to protect them from the outbreaks spread and what calls go too far To better understand what is permissibleand requiredin confronting a publichealth crisis in the workplace The Wall Street Journal consulted employment lawyers and other workplace experts The answers often lie somewhere in the murky balance between the Americans with Disabilities Act or ADA which aims to safeguard individuals privacy and Occupational Safety and Health Administration standards designed to protect workers safety But the body of labor rules and regulations suggest its wise to stick to the following guidelines the experts say Here are answers to some of the most common questions from employees Can my employer cancel my vacation time and make me work instead In most workplaces yes Vacation time isnt guaranteed under federal law and most employers are within their rights to cancel a vacation and require workers to return to the job saysnnnnnnnnnn      n      Kenneth G DauSchmidtnnnn      a professor of labor and employment law at Indiana University Bloomington The exception is if an employee is covered by a union contract or specific employment agreement that includes certain timeoff protections he says Still most bosses know that pulling a vacation is bound to be an unpopular move a reason many are loath to do it unless an emergency requires it People can get upset if vacations are canceled Prof DauSchmidt says That would be the major limit on it What if my boss tells me to cancel my personal travel plans Is that legal Employers cant dictate how you spend your personal time even if they do make a recommendation against travel to certain regions saysnnnnnnnnnn      n      Roberta Matusonnnnn      an executive coach and author of Evergreen Talent A Guide to Hiring and Cultivating a Sustainable Workforce Does the company have to pay for a canceled trip If a boss insists on an employee cutting a trip go ahead and ask for reimbursement Some employers will see that as a reasonable request But legally they arent required to pay unless an employment contract specifically calls for it Mr DauSchmidt says I really feel uncomfortable about commuting into work and increasing my risk of exposure Do I have the right to work from home Employers generally dont have an obligation to allow telecommuting saysnnnnnnnnnn      n      Mitch Boyarskynnnn      a labor and employment lawyer with Nelson Mullins Riley  Scarborough LLP An exception is an employee who qualifies under the ADA to work remotely to accommodate a disability Another might be if the government is ordering a quarantine other lawyers say Then an employer could have more of a burden to allow remote work I feel totally fine and dont think Im at risk but my boss is insisting I work from home Do I have to Yes Employers are within their rights to ask employees to work remotely as long as theyre not applying a policy in a way that could be deemed discriminatory saysnnnnnnnnnn      n      Angela B Cornellnnnn      a clinical professor at Cornell Law School and director of the schools Labor Law Clinic For example its OK to ask workers who have recently traveled to China Italy Iran or another country especially hard hit by the outbreak to work from home for a given period But its not all right to ask workers over the age of 70 to work from homeeven if the intentions are wellmeaningbecause age is a protected class under federal law My employer has requested that I work from home Does that mean they can order me not to run errands or go to church While your boss can ask you not to come into the office they cant bar you from going to other places or say hopping on the subway That said your employer can offer recommendations on how much to venture from home says Heather Bussing an employment lawyer in Sonoma County Calif with Rybicki  Associates PC You can educate and you can encourage but you cant control she says of employers My job requires me to have a lot of close contact with many customers Am I protected if I say I cant perform my job because of the outbreak Workers are protected from retaliation from an employer if they refuse to take on what they consider an unsafe work assignment saysnnnnnnnnnn      n      Howard Mavitynnnn      an Atlantabased partner in the workplacesafety practice of law firm Fisher  Phillips LLP He advises employers to listen carefully to employee concerns You cant discipline someone for complaining about safety he says It becomes less straightforward though if a reasonable employee would otherwise deem the assignment safe Mr Mavity says If a hotel housekeeper for example has received the necessary training to protect against Covid19 along with proper gloves and equipment it may not be considered reasonable to refuse to clean a hotel room That wouldnt really be protected he says If a hotel is known to be housing guests with Covid19 its a different story and housekeepers might be able to refuse the assignment he says Do I have to take that business trip Minnesota employment lawyernnnnnnnnnn      n      Kate Bischoffnnnn      says your boss can require you to go on a business trip There can be the ultimatum that you have to go on this or you can lose your job she says Her advice for workers Come up with a strong case for how technology could make a virtual meeting effective For employers she urges caution Making such an ultimatum is going to spread like wildfire through your organization she says prompting lots of workers to rethink their ties to the company It is a strategic mistake It could also be a legal mistake depending on the circumstancesnnnnnnnnnn      n      Daniel Schwartznnnn      a partner with law firm Shipman  Goodwin who mainly represents Connecticut employers points to a case in Connecticut where the court indicated it could be illegal to require a worker to travel somewhere unsafe Can my employer take my temperature at work The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission says that according to the Americans with Disabilities Act measuring an employees temperature generally is considered a medical examination and usually beyond the bounds of what an employer can do or require But in an especially severe or widespread influenza outbreak such a check is permissible That rule is likely to apply to a coronavirus epidemic as well But even if its legal to take an employees temperature many lawyers and health experts dont think its useful Maybe they have the flu Mr Schwartz says of employees with elevated temperatures And health officials have said many people with the coronavirus have had no fever What if I end up catching Covid19 at work Is my employer liable Unlikelybecause its usually hard to prove If an employee suffers an injury on the job such as slipping or falling then the worker is often entitled to workers compensation which can cover certain medical care and lost wages says Ms Cornell But with the coronavirus it could be tough to determine exactly where someone contracted the virus making it difficult to hold an employer responsible for medical costs Generally a staffer must prove that the disease was caused by conditions peculiar to the work and there were no other opportunities for exposure according to guidance by Fisher  Phillips to employers My employer knew a coworker contracted the virus but didnt inform the rest of staff right away Werent they required to Generally yes Companies have an obligation to warn those who may have come in contact with someone diagnosed with Covid19 says Ms Cornell Local health authorities may also want the public to know But its highly unlikely a company would identify the employee in question by name That could violate confidentiality requirements under the ADA Mr Mavity says Instead employers are more likely to note that a staffer on a certain floor or part of the building contracted the virus It will take about a 12th of a second for everyone to know youre talking about Joe but you dont say Joe Mr Mavity says If I come down with Covid19 do I have to tell my employer Cant I just say I need to take sick time and leave it at that There may not be a legal requirement but there is an ethical one Ms Matuson says If you work in an office or interact with colleagues in person its a good idea to alert your company to your diagnosis so managers can tell others If you work remotely and have had no direct contact with colleagues clients or other people through your job though such a disclosure may not be necessary Ms Matuson says I would just say Im not feeling well  she says Ms Feintzeig and Mr Cutter are Wall Street Journal reporters in New York

could no longer do either Hong Kongs government closed schools on Feb 3 as the spread of the coronavirus was accelerating in mainland China and they have yet to reopen The semiautonomous city had fewer than 20 confirmed cases in early February but they were enough to trigger closures of government offices tourist hot spots and many public facilities Dow Jones the parent company of The Wall Street Journal followed government advisories and closed its Hong Kong Shanghai and Beijing offices for a month Employees were told to work from home and avoid congregating It is an experience many in the US are now facing to one degree or another sudden school and office closures event cancellations shortages of toilet paper and cleaning supplies and fears about being exposed to the contagious respiratory virus Parents are worrying about how theyll manage child care and remotework arrangements and how long all this could last And we are all learning that we will have to be very adaptable for the foreseeable future Living under the new restrictions meant spending a lot of time at homeand making it serve as an office and a school as well as a living space It wasnt an ideal fit a 650squarefoot twobedroom flat a cluttered space shared by two adults two rambunctious boys and a cat The children initially cheered upon learning about the school closures thinking that meant an extended holiday We all sighed when the American international school my sons attend said that virtual lessons would be conducted over the course of each school day There would be live teaching via Google Hangouts assignments that students had to complete in set time frames and online music art and physicaleducation classes Parents were told to download education and reading apps and were given links to folders with slide presentations video recordings online meetings and numerous worksheets My sonsages 5 and 7couldnt take part in live lessons concurrently from our single family computer so I went out and bought an iPad and a printer At the shop a salesman said he had sold more than a dozen printers that same day to people just like you who have kids that will be schooling at home Then there was the question of workspace With no space for study desks in the bedrooms the children have been using the dining table couch and coffee tables for virtual school lessons on weekdays Initially I thought I could set up my work laptop in a common area in my apartment complex with tables and chairs after cleaning them with disinfecting wipesbut that venue was also closed by the buildings management On the first day of virtual school I felt my stress level rising as my kids called out for me to help them as I tried to answer emails and messages from work Leave them to me said my husband a fulltime dad and I left the apartment to find an alternative venue I texted a coworker and asked if I could come to her flat to work She obliged though I felt like I was contravening office rules about working remotely and worried that I might unknowingly infect her if I caught the virus on the subway en route to her home As a stopgap measure my company rented two small rooms in a hostel and set up screens and workstations for staffers who couldnt work from home I spent several days there before the rooms were abruptly closed when Hong Kongs health authorities said there was a confirmed coronavirus case in a nearby building I eventually found another locationthe studio apartment of another coworker who was out of the country It was a quiet respite from my home but hunching over a small laptop and working in isolation for days on end with contact with coworkers limited to emails and phone calls brought its own difficulties Many including myself struggled with concentration and the lack of facetoface interactions We organized several online group meetings so that people could share experiences and stay in touch with each other I also felt guilty that my spouse was shouldering the burden of getting the children through their schoolwork so I stayed in some mornings to help But trying to get a 5yearold to sit in front of a screen and watch his teacher talk for more than 10 minutes is a challenge in itself One day I let him paint a picture while he listened passively to a 45minute online music lesson we turned off the iPad camera so that the teacher couldnt see him With libraries gyms museums theme parks and most sports facilities closed in our leisure time we have been going hiking hanging out at the beach and cycling in the sun We still eat at our favorite restaurants on weekends I carry hand sanitizer and wipes everywhere but have accepted that I cant keep all our hands clean all the time My children have also refused to wear masks complaining they are uncomfortable Weve had to make other adjustments When food and cleaning supplies were in short supply in stores last month I bought a halfliter bottle of hand sanitizer from a neighbor who had stocked up on it during a work trip in Finland My husband went to the supermarket every few days at its 8 am opening time to buy rice toilet paper and wipes before panic buyers came and cleared the shelves During this period my secondgrader had to use scrounge in a sentence for phonics class He wrote I have to scrounge for TP That turned into a delicate subject I gave a few rolls of toilet paper to coworkers who were unable to buy them One gave me Purell wipes that she had bought fromnnnnnnnnnnn            Amazoncomnnn      in return Dow Jones partially reopened its Hong Kong and China offices at the beginning of March bringing back a sense of normalcy for staffers Employees have to use a signup sheet to reserve spots go through daily temperature checks at the office reception and wash or sanitize their hands upon arrival The earliest date Hong Kong schools will reopen is April 20 The city likely has to go through at least 14 days without a new coronavirus infection before the government will let students and teachers congregate again That has yet to happen Hong Kong this week reported more than a dozen new infections raising its total cases to around 130 Friends who lived in Hong Kong during the 2003 SARS epidemic predict that schools wont reopen until the next academic year begins in August It is a prospect I dread but we will probably go on doing what were doing As our new normal has set in Ive learned to appreciate the small freedoms we still have and how resilient my children have been I previously had only a vague idea about what they were learning in school and now I can see every detail of every lesson Last week the boys wrote poems came up with alliterative sentences sketched animals and submitted math worksheets and recordings of themselves reading to their teachers A few days ago my 7yearold figured out how to email me at work during his virtual school day hi mom dont forget to send things he wrote in a string of emails to which I replied with emojis and asked him to focus on his lessons At 3 pm the email chain concluded with his last message END OF SCHOOL11 YAY Ms Ng is The Wall Street Journals Asia finance editor in

https//wwwwsjcom/articles/thedosanddontsofhandwashing11583952006 Publichealth officials across the globe are urging people to wash their hands calling it one of the best methods to prevent further spread of the new coronavirus But decades of research tell a sobering truth People need to learn a thing or two about personal hygiene Many dont know proper handwashing technique They do it for too little time or they dont do it at all Proper handwashing means scrubbing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Yet just 5 of people spent more than 15 seconds washing their hands after using the restroom and 10 didnt wash their hands at all in a study of 3749 college students published in the Journal of Environmental Health in 2013 How to Wash Your Hands Hands are villages to thousands of germsincluding bacteria and viruses All it takes is a friendly handshake to spread respiratory diseases like Covid19 the disease caused by the new virus Respiratory droplets from coughs and sneezes can also spread these germs as can touching surfaces like doorknobs and phones where those droplets may have landed I dont think we need to panic says Elaine Larson professor emerita of nursing research at the Columbia School of Nursing who has helped the World Health Organization develop handwashing guidelines But we do need to be reminded about basic hygiene The viruss fate is in your handsliterallyso experts say its time to start practicing what science is preaching Use soap Before applying soap to your hands run water over them Soap and water together with rubbing is what helps rinse organisms off your hands and down the drain Dont worry about removing hand jewelry Dr Larson says Those need to be washed too Soap acts as a surfactant a substance that helps release bacterias grip from your hand when water is added The study of college students however showed only two in three people used soap The rest just rinsed their hands Dr Larson suggests half a teaspoon of liquid soap is enough or a glob about the size of a quarter although bigger hands might need more Health experts say that too much soap can remove your skins natural oils which have helpful antibacterial properties The CDC says studies havent shown that soaps with antibacterial ingredients provide any health benefits or remove more germs than plain soaps All soaps however can deactivate a coronavirus so it can no longer infect you The new coronavirus coined SARSCoV2 is a spherical structure with spiky proteins attached to a membrane or envelope that protects the pathogens genetic material Once it comes into contact with soap this envelope dissolves leaving behind a dysfunctional virus The envelope is a machine that allows the virus to sneak into human cells says Jonathan Abraham an assistant professor of microbiology at Harvard Medical School Without it the virus cannot infect you Scrub all surfaces of your hands People on average wash their hands for only about six seconds according to several studies Twenty seconds is whats recommendedor the length of the Happy Birthday song sung twicethough it depends on what you touched and how often And even 20 seconds is not helpful if youre not washing the right places Dr Larson says Its about quality not quantity The most vulnerable parts of your hands are your fingertips between your fingers the backs of your hands and under your nails Rubbing these surfaces with enough force is critical health experts say People who have longer nails should be extra cautious they add Scrubbing too hard or too frequently can damage your skin by making it dry and more susceptible to cracking Dr Larson says Cuts and cracks give germs the perfect spot to set up shop To avoid skin damage Dr Larson recommends using a moisturizer after washing Studies have shown that water temperature doesnt affect how many germs are removed The CDC says warm or cold water will do but some experts warn that when water is too hot it can also damage skin After a thorough scrub with soap remove all suds by rubbing every surface of your hands under running clean water to ensure that pathogens get washed away Dr Abraham says Leaving some soap behind may also soak up moisture from your hands leaving them dry and more likely to crack Dry your hands completely Now its time to dry your hands as thoroughly as you can because moist hands give living organisms a better chance of surviving and spreading to others Dr Abraham says The CDC says there is not enough data to confirm whether a significant amount of germs are transferred from the faucet knob to your hands Some experts suggest using a paper towel to turn the water off while others discourage it because it wastes paper towels Automatic blowers and paper towels both dry hands well Use alcoholbased sanitizers in a pinch If youre on the go alcoholbased sanitizers are great alternatives to soap and water They cannot kill all viruses like the norovirus which lacks a dissolvable envelope But a sanitizer can kill any coronavirus on your hands as long as its made up of at least 60 alcohol health experts say Plain rubbing alcohol also works but sanitizers maintain a balance of alcohol and other ingredients to help keep skin healthy and moisturized Its important to use enough sanitizer to cover the entire hand Dr Larson suggests half to one teaspoon Sanitizer also works only when its still wet so health experts advise against using paper towels to dab your hands Give the product at least 10 seconds to complete its job then rub your hands together or let them airdry Get an earlymorning coronavirus briefing each weekday plus a healthnews update Fridays Sign up Ms Camero is a reporter for The Wall

businesses including gyms be shut down Please follow local guidance The gym an escape and haven in the daytoday lives of millions has become yet another source of anxiety in the age of coronavirus As cases of Covid19 rise in the US health officials are urging people to practice social distancing That could make spin classes and yoga sessions seem more harmful than healthy Yet many fitness fanatics crave exercise more than ever and are forging forward while taking precautions Tony Maloneynnnn      the fitness center manager at National Institute for Fitness and Sport in Indianapolis points out that people should be exercising now more than ever When endorphin levels go up it can counteract the stress response that is so damaging to the immune system he says Exercise also improves mental health When youre feeling down or stressed exercise can put a smile on your face Madison Mitteness still braves the treadmill at her gym in New York City but says she wont touch the dumbbells or weight machines for fear of germs Her logic that the more people touch shared objects the higher their risk of transmitting a virus isnt unfounded But according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention coronavirus spreads more easily between people standing within about 6 feet than through contact with contaminated surfaces Cleaning and disinfecting surfaces appears to lower the chances of transmission Gregory Poland director of the Vaccine Research Group at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester Minn says the gym isnt necessarily riskier than any other communal area but people should remain vigilant His tactic at the gym has been to use hand sanitizerat least 60 alcoholbasedliberally every time he touches a piece of equipment In general things like gym towels he says are less risky since fewer people touch them If someone with the virus has coughed or sneezed and then touches an inanimate object like a dumbbell or even the pen for a signin sheet there is an increased chance of transmission but no more than the flu he says In the past four months there have been over 800 cases of novel coronavirus in the US that we know of and as of Tuesday 28 deaths If you live in a city with an outbreak Dr Poland suggests skipping the studio and getting your endorphin fix at home through an online class or app Outdoor exercise is also safe he says as long as you keep a distance from people A triathlon where you are jammed up with others wouldnt be smart he says However if you live someplace that has not experienced an outbreak he suggests taking the same precautions you would during flu season He recommends getting a flu vaccine and working out in areas with a minimum of 3 to 5 feet between pieces of equipment or other people And dont just rinse your hands Wash them for at least 20 seconds I have never seen a lay person wash their hands properly he says You put your fingertips not your palms in your eyes nose or mouth No one washes their fingertips Gyms and fitness studios across the country have stepped up hygiene messaging and measures to give members peace of mind Barrys Bootcamp advised clients to avoid kissing hugging and the sharing of cups and water bottles at the gym And Equinox says it is disinfecting all clubs with a hospitalgrade solution three times a day Its asked instructors to eliminate skintoskin contact such as adjustments in yoga Keith Worts the CEO of Crunch Signature says the company hasnt seen a change in usage over the past three weeks The biggest behavioral shift weve seen is that more people wipe down their equipment before and after use he says Nathan Reynannnn      a member of Elite by NYSC an upscale offshoot of New York Sports Club says he feels less paranoid going to the gym because he feels that his gyms management is taking the coronavirus threat seriously Not only have they emailed tips on how to combat the virus but they have amped up deep cleans he says Mr Reyna who says the gym is both his social hub and stress reliever still takes extra precaution and brings his own disinfectant wipes and thoroughly washes his hands before and after his workouts I see a lot more people doing the same he says Maybe this should be the new norm Kate Pallardynnnn      an elite runner and New York Sports Club member says shes always washed her hands well pre and postworkout For me this is like the scares weve had with Zika SARS or the flu she says No virus will ever stop me from working out The continued spread of coronavirus has put hygiene at the top of everyones mind Gyms and fitness studios are urging members to follow the CDC guidelines for preventing the spread of Covid19 the disease caused by the coronavirus Beyond washing your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and not touching your eyes nose and mouth with unwashed hands heres what fitness companies and health experts are suggesting people do to stay clean while exercising  If you or someone in your household is sick stay home from the gym  Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue then throw the tissue in the trash  Avoid the sauna and steam room Those with colds often use them to break up congestion in the sinuses and lungs  Use the disinfectant wipes available at the gym to wipe down machines and equipment before and after each use  For surface cleaning check with your gym to see if its products say disinfectant on the label and include an EPA registration number  Use hand sanitizers that are at least 60 alcohol  Bring your own yoga mat to class  Avoid contact such as handson assists passing over membership cards at checkin or highfives with instructors  Avoid packed classes where students are shouldertoshoulder Try to maintain 6 feet of distance from other people  Work out at home using a jump rope or an app or streamable workout  Copyright 2020 Dow Jones  Company Inc All Rights Reserved 87990cbe856818d5eddac44c7b1cdeb8 Appeared in the March 13 2020 print edition as ''   "

Wall Street Journal","https://www.wsj.com","www.wsj.com","c https//wwwwsjcom/articles/coronavirusvsfluwhichvirusisdeadlier11583856879 The new coronavirus and the seasonal flu are similar in many ways Both are respiratory diseases that spread through droplets of fluid from the mouth and nose of someone who is infected Both are contagious produce similar symptoms and can be deadly But there are some major differences While both produce many of the same symptomsfever cough and muscle achesand are particularly hard on the elderly they come from two different families of viruses People have more protection from the flu because there is a vaccine and they are exposed to flu viruses every year There is no vaccine yet to protect people against Covid19 the disease caused by the new virus I think what were seeing with Covid19 is what influenza would look like without a vaccine saidnnnnnnnnnn      n      Neil Fishmannnnn      who is chief medical officer at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania and an infectiousdisease specialist  Scientists havent yet established exactly how deadly or transmissible the new virus is But so far the new coronavirus appears to be deadlier than the seasonal flu which kills thousands of Americans every season Calculations of the mortality rate for Covid19 have ranged between 2 and 34 since the virus was identified in China in January according to World Health Organization data Those percentages are derived by dividing the number of confirmed deaths globally into the number of confirmed cases By contrast the seasonal flu has a death rate of approximately 01 Covid19s higher death rate is one reason that billionaire globalhealth philanthropistnnnnnnnnnn      n      Bill Gatesnnnn      recently warned in an article in the New England Journal of Medicine that Covid19 has started behaving a lot like the onceinacentury pathogen weve been worried about But publichealth scientists say the real death rate is probably lower than the current estimates US health officials suggested in another article in the New England Journal of Medicine that the death rate could be well below 1 Other estimates have ranged between 1 and 2 Thats because current calculations are based on tallies of people who were ill enough to be tested they wrote Epidemiologists say they are certain there are many more people who were infected but didnt receive a testeither because they werent ill enough to get one or didnt have access to a test Problems with a test developed in the US means many people havent been able to get one Studies suggest there are also people who were infected but had no symptoms We dont know the proportion of mild or asymptomatic casesnnnnnnnnnn      n      Marc Lipsitchnnnn      professor of epidemiology at Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health and director of the Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics said in a recent teleconference In addition the mortality rate has differed by region and by intensity of transmission according to a report by an international mission to China of experts led by the WHO It was 58 in an explosive initial outbreak in Wuhan But in other lesshardhit areas of China which had more time to prepare to care for patients it was 07 The rate in China has come down over time the report said In South Korea which has had more than 7000 cases the mortality rate is 07 To calculate the infection fatality ratemeaning an infected persons risk of deathwill require largescale studies to determine how many people in an area where there has been an outbreak have antibodies to the virus in their blood Dr Lipsitch said That would show how many people had been infected he said Have you been tested for flu or coronavirus What was your experience Join the conversation below Two blood tests have been licensed in China to conduct such studies according to the WHO The new coronavirus called SARS CoV2 infects the lower respiratory tract About 80 of people in a cohort of nearly 56000 people in China had either mild or moderate illnesses according to the report by the experts who traveled to China Those illnesses started with a fever dry cough fatigue and other flulike symptoms but sometimes included shortness of breath and progressed to a mild form of pneumonia according to the report Another 138 became severely ill requiring oxygen and 61 were critical meaning respiratory and organ failure according to the report People over the age of 60 and those with underlying conditions such as cardiovascular disease chronic lung disease diabetes and cancer were at highest risk the report said Get an earlymorning briefing about the coronavirus each weekday and a weekly Health newsletter when the crisis abates There are contradictory reports of how transmissible Covid19 is The disease does not seem to spread as easily as the flu according to the WHO which found that most of the spread in China was through close contacts like family members Other disease modeling suggests the new virus is more transmissible than the flu Experts say the new coronavirus may appear to be more transmissible than flu right now because people have at least some immunity to seasonal flu viruses since the flu goes around every year and there is a flu vaccine About 34 million people in the US have had the flu this season which is still ongoing but starting to ease according to the latest flu report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Of them about 20000 have died Flu strains change slightly every year and the number of deaths depends on how severe the strains that are circulating that season are according to the CDC The most severe flu pandemic in recent history killed tens of millions of people in 1918 and 1919 meaning more than 25 of those it infected according to CDC research Write to Betsy McKay at betsymckaywsjcom Copyright 2020 Dow Jones  Company Inc All Rights Reserved 87990cbe856818d5eddac44c7b1cdeb8 Appeared in the March 13

here to tell you how to clean your smartphone That is if you really want to clean your phone Three people I spoke with over the past week said they did not clean their smartphonesand theyre all leading experts on microbiology and infectious disease WAIT WHAT I thought smartphones were dirtier than a toilet bowl Heck even academic studies like this one from my favorite bedtime reading the Journal of Hospital Infection have found considerable amounts of bacteria including fecal matter on phone screens And yet all these experts said some variation of the same thing when I asked about combating coronavirus thoroughly clean your hands dont touch your face dont worry about your phone How have you cleaned your phone in the past Do you plan to change your ways Join the conversation below Sure except what if youre one of those people where your smartphone is basically an extension of your hand What if I touch a dirty subway pole then touch my phone then my phone touches my face What if someone sneezes directly on my iPhone screen What if Im the kind of person who licks my phone Dont judge A recent study found that on surfaces such as metal glass or plastic coronavirus can survive for anywhere between two hours and nine days Its possible theoretically for this to live on a smartphone If you had it out and someone sneezed or coughed on it and then you handled the phone you could pick up infection that way saysnnnnnnnnnn      n      Daniel R Kuritzkesnnnn      chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases at Brigham and Womens Hospital People should keep their phones close to themselves There is very little risk involved then My phone is the least of my concerns saysnnnnnnnnnn      n      Alex Berezownnnn      a microbiologist and vice president at the American Council on Science and Health Worry about touching door handles that thousands of other people touch After days of disinfecting my phone like a surgical tray I was shocked Phone cleaning is certainly not as cut and dried as you thought After hours of research and scrubbing phones with everything fromnnnnnnnnnnn            Cloroxnnn      wipes to Lysol toiletbowl cleaner Ive come up with some basic lessons for what you can doand not dowith that petri dish phone of yours Lets be very clear Even when there isnt a pandemic sweeping the globe your phone can get dirty Generally that filth is not an issue saysnnnnnnnnnn      n      Emma Hayhurstnnnn      a microbiologist at the University of South Wales and coauthor on the aforementioned Journal of Hospital Infection paper We were trying to avoid mass panic about mucky phones When you are healthy its really not a problem Translation You should clean your phonejust not compulsively We dont need to be obsessively washing our phones right now If people are coming into contact with coronavirus patients then yes Wash your phone all the time Not because there is evidence that it will transmit via a phone but because there is no evidence that it wont says Dr Hayhurst Its long been the guidance ofnnnnnnnnnnn            Applennnnnnn            Samsungnnn      and other phone makers to just use a microfiber cloth to shine up your device All my new infectiousdisease friends however say that to effectively kill the virus on a surface you need disinfectant solutionfor instance something with at least 55 isopropyl alcohol On Monday I reported that Apple updated its website to remove its blanket ban on all cleaning supplies It now gives the OK to use a 70 isopropyl alcohol wipe or Clorox disinfecting wipe on the surface of all Apple products Google also confirmed that its OK to use isopropyl alcohol or Clorox wipes to clean its Pixel devices After publication of this column Samsung updated its cleaning guidance to include alcoholbased cleaners It now advises Galaxy owners to dampen a cloth with a disinfectant or alcoholbased solution and wipe gently It says not to apply liquid directly onto your phone Of course the big question right now is where do you BUY the wipes Can you use soap and water as many have asked me Sure but avoid using rough paper towels or sponges on the screen And never use bleach The big cleaningsolution fear cited by smartphone makers is damage to your phone screens oleophobic layer This is a protective coating on your screen that repels both water and oil Basically it helps minimize fingerprints and smudges Cleaning products and abrasive materials will diminish the coating and might scratch your iPhone Apples website reads I took it upon myself to test that as youll see in the video above Using a brandnew iPhone 8 I wiped the screen 1095 times with Clorox disinfecting wipes I figured thats the equivalent of wiping down your phone every day for the three years you might own it The only thing showing any wear after all that wiping My poor wrinkly fingers The coating still repelled drops of olive oil like it did when I first took it out of the box So I upped the effort I was told that hydrochloric acid found in toiletbowl cleaner would take it right off Yet after five minutes of scrubbing it was still fine Soft Scrub with some bleach for five minutes Still in decent shape Finally I decided to let it sit in a stew of toiletbowl cleaner for two hours then I threw in a fiveminute rubdown with nailpolish remover which has acetone That did itjust about The phone miraculously still worked Should you do any of that Absolutely not but these screens are far more resistant to these products than Id thought Plus the oleophobic layer on your phone is going to wear from normal use anyway When cleaning with your disinfecting wipes however avoid getting liquid in the ports Even if most phones are now water resistant that resistance wears over time Theres a big difference between cleaning glass or metal and cleaning silicone plastic or genuine leather Apple provides good advice on cleaning the various materials its cases are made of Even if you dont have an official Apple case these tips can be helpful When I was at a hospital last week I met a nurse who had a phone case especially for work She still cleans it every day If youre not into getting your phone and hands all wet you can try a UV sanitizing gadget like the 100 PhoneSoap Go Pop your phone in the tiny tanning bed for 10 minutes and the company claims to kill 999 of bacteria and germs on it Why use this instead of a wipe Well because apparently we suck at cleaning People dont cover the whole phone well with disinfecting solutions according to PhoneSoap chief executive and cofoundernnnnnnnnnn      n      Wesley LaPortennnn      Plus if you dont let the cleaning solution sit for a whileClorox recommends four minutes on its containersome bacteria might survive This disinfects in a consistent manner Mr LaPorte says I was too busy killing oleophobic coating to test this independently but the microbiologists I spoke with said UV light can be an effective way to kill bacteria PhoneSoap says it has seen 1000 revenue growth this year due to increased interest in phone cleaning since the coronavirus spread Last week inventory the company put up on Amazon sold out within an hour Samsung is fine with you using PhoneSoap or its competitorsand is even offering free UV cleaning at select Samsung stores if you feel like venturing out Apple doesnt explicitly offer instore cleaning but store employees are known to clean gadgets using wipes with 70 isopropyl alcohol Our anxieties are at an alltime high understandably If cleaning makes you feel better grab some wipes and go to town Wipe for hourseven days Your phone will be just fine Just remember you really dont need to Unless youre one of those crazy phone lickers Kenny Wassus contributed to this

tapping big data machine learning and other digital tools The goal is to get realtime forecasts and other critical information to frontline healthcare workers and public policy makers as the outbreak unfolds Known as outbreak analytics the approach attempts to go beyond confirmed cases and fatalities to gauge the total number of people who are likely to be infected by a viruswhether or not they show any symptoms Besides advancements in medicine advancements in information technology and digital data are how we defeat this pandemic and prevent another Spanish flulike outcome saidnnnnnnnnnn

fatalities test results tracing contacts of infected people maps of population densities and demographics traveler flows and migration availability of healthcare services drug stockpiles and other factors The raw data is then processed into compatible formatsincreasingly by machinelearning software trained to recognize patterns and clean up diverse data sourcesand fed into algorithmic models The models are designed to predict the number of new cases that are likely to arise in an exposed population or peak infection rates under a given set of conditions among other outcomes Eyal Zimlichmannnnn      chief medical officer and chief innovation officer at Sheba Medical Center in Israel said the hospital relies on such datadriven forecasts to ensure it has sufficient personnel and resources in place as the coronavirus spreads This includes doubling the capacity of its isolated coronavirus units and isolated intensive care unit Dr Zimlichman said The hospital has treated 40 patients for Covid19 including 30 who remain hospitalized he said As of Tuesday there were more than 5200 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 92 deaths in the US and more than 190000 cases worldwide The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began expanding the use of bigdata tools in flu forecasting roughly seven years ago The agency last year awarded 3 million in funding to a research team at the University of Massachusetts Amhersts School of Public Health and Health Sciences to develop a databased flu forecasting center A group at Carnegie Mellon University received funding for a similar center Both teams are using these forecasting tools to help contain the coronavirus in part by pooling together dozens of analytic models from multiple sources Open platforms allow forecasters to share data and code a strategy that helps piece together consistent and accurate predictions Nicholas Reichnnnn      a biostatistician who leads the University of Massachusetts Amherst team said one of the projects goals is to provide userfriendly information on virus infections to the public which could include the development of a smartphone app to issue more timely alerts If we can

it difficult to build accurate models for the US Even if testing was perfect we would still be undercounting because the illness takes time to show symptoms Mr Pueyo said For the few early days during which you dont have symptoms you have it and youre spreading it His model estimates the total number of coronavirus cases in the US at roughly 60000 as of Friday On Monday a team of experts at Oxford

would significantly help to contain the spread of coronavirus Christopher Frasernnnn      a professor of pathogen dynamics at Oxford Universitys Big Data Institute who led the team said the app could be used as a key data source for outbreak analytics What you get out will depend on details of algorithms and the way the data flows are set up Mr Fraser said Everyone understands that privacy and security are paramount but so is tracking and controlling this epidemic he said adding that implementing many of these tools falls on public policy makers Jared Council contributed to this article

https//wwwwsjcom/articles/coronaviruspandemiccouldelevateesgfactors11585167518 The recent volatility in financial markets due to the coronavirus pandemic could provide investors with more of an incentive to grill companies on nonfinancial risks Environmental social and governance investing was growing in popularity before the virus began to circulate as investors flocked to companies that have taken steps to manage nonfinancial risks related to matters such as climate change board diversity or human rights issues in the supply chain But the pandemic has demonstrated on a large scale the importance of other factors that are paramount to ESG investors Among them disaster preparedness continuity planning and employee treatment through benefits such as paid sick leave as companies direct employees to work from home Our Morning Risk Report features insights and news on governance risk and compliance A group of 300 mutual funds that integrate ESG factors into their investment decisions attracted 214 billion in new money in 2019 compared with 54 billion a year earlier according to data from Morningstar Inc Companies should expect more investors to ask questions about resilience and contingency planning viewing the issues in light of the pandemic as relevant to a companys longterm performance according to Jeff Meli global head of research at British investment banknnnnnnnnnnn            Barclaysnnn      PLC Down the line those conversations could evolve to broader ESG discussions including topics such as whether telecommuting could reduce a companys carbon footprint he said in an interview Tuesday There is obviously a lot of volatility and a lot of big open questions just in the very near term that need to get answered Mr Meli said Over the long term I think if anything this would likely accelerate the focus on ESG from an investor standpoint Barclays on Tuesday said it would begin providing ESG assessments for each of the companies that it covers Citigroup Incnnn      meanwhile in a note to clients said investors are asking more questions about issues such as employee benefits and mortgage relief with the goal of identifying corporate strategies to limit the economic damage from the pandemic The bank said it expects the pandemic to affect priorities in ESG as well as conversations on the pros and cons of having temporary workers and stock buybacks to become the new focus for corporate governance The corporate response to the pandemicfor instance the decision by car makernnnnnnnnnnn            Ford Motor Connn      and other companies to manufacture medical suppliescould highlight for some investors the role that private companies play in addressing social problems according to George Serafeim a professor of business administration at Harvard Business School who focuses on sustainability More and more people are understanding that companies are part of the solution Mr Serafeim said describing the impact of corporate strategies on issues such as climate change Some investors agree and note the pandemics impact on markets is a reminder that environmental and social problems are financial risks they need to manage appropriately We have long argued that companies dont operate in a vacuum said Andrew Howard head of sustainable research at UK asset manager Schroders PLC Their success reflects their ability to adapt to challenges and trends in the societies to which they belong That is more true now than ever social and environmental challenges and investment drivers are increasingly overlapping  Whether or not the pandemic sharpens investors focus on ESG factors remains to be seen Its possible investors could have the opposite reaction in the months and years ahead viewing ESG and a focus on social policies as an impediment to a companys financial recovery saidnnnnnnnnnn      n      Katherine Kleinnnnn      vice dean of the Wharton Social Impact Initiative at the University of Pennsylvanias Wharton School At the very least investors and prospective employees should view the crisisand how companies respondas an opportunity to ask questions about the social issues that matter

https//wwwwsjcom/articles/thekidsarehomeyouneedtoworkwhatdoyoudo11585144182 With millions of people now hunkered down at home amid the Covid19 pandemic families across the world face a daunting challenge How can parents keep working and children keep learning while theyre on top of each other And how can they stay sane during it all We talked to pediatricians educators and child psychologists to get their advice on everything from daily schedules and screen time to how best to motivate kids to do their online schoolwork Heres what they said Yes your child does need some sort of schedule No it doesnt have to look like the typical school day Ambitious colorcoded schedules that divide the day into 45minute blocks filled with productive activities have proliferated on social media But such a rigorous schedule may just set families up for failure says Roberta Lenger Kang director of the Center for the Professional Development of Teachers at Teachers College Columbia University Take time to figure out what works for your family Dr Lenger Kang who lives in New York City has important online meetings in the morning and needs to be quickly responding to emails then So her three children ages 4 6 and 13 spend their mornings going on walks with their father playing with Legos and having screen time After lunch she helps them with their school work Think about the learning That is the important thing not the timing she says Still kids do need a structure says Rebecca Rialon Berry clinical associate professor of child and adolescent psychiatry at NYU Langone Health Children thrive on routine which can help them feel safe regulated and calm she says So neither kids nor parents should lounge in their PJs all day no matter how tempting that may be In the morning children should do their typical gettingreadyforschool routine such as brushing teeth making beds and dressing in what theyd usually wear to school Dr Rialon Berry says Keep bedtimes and wake times relatively consistent Daily physical activity is important too Take time for recess outside or an indoor dance party And give children a say in their schedules Youll get more buyin that way she says It can be helpful to define the beginning of the school day in a physical way such as going for a walk says Mary Alvord a psychologist in Chevy Chase Md That can provide at least some psychological separation between home and school Be creativeand try virtual helpto motivate kids to do their schoolwork As any parent who has dealt with evening homework tussles knows it can sometimes be tough to get kids to complete their assignments And now theres a whole lot more schoolwork that parents are on the hook to supervise What activities and websites do you recommend for keeping children engaged Join the conversation below Opt for positive reinforcement over negative corrections advises Dr Lenger Kang For younger kids under age 8 or so giving out highfives can be enough The reward of a snack or screen time after a certain amount of schoolwork can also motivate kids she says Dr Alvord suggests hiring highschool or college students who likely have a lot more time on their hands now as virtual tutors for an hour or so a day to supervise schoolwork It is a way to change the dynamic she says Children will think it is kind of cool to spend time with an older student and will more likely get their work done without a struggle It can also ratchet down tension within the family Parents must agree about who is on While middle and highschool students may be relatively selfsufficient during their athome school day especially as more school districts get their curricula up and running most elementaryschoolers and younger children will need a parent to supervise Parents must work out who does what and whenbut not in front of the children Divvying up household responsibilities can cause conflict in the best of times When both parents are working from home there can be a lot of conflict around whose job is more important who has a deadline says Paul Donahue a child psychologist in Scarsdale NY As much as possible we want to iron out those issues and responsibilities outside of earshot of the kids he says Each person has to make sacrifices Screentime rules can be relaxed A lot Pediatrician Dimitri Christakis is a lead author of the American Academy of Pediatrics media guidelines for young children which recommend that preschoolers ages 2 to 5 limit screen use to one hour per day of highquality programs But even he says those recommendations are unrealistic in the current reality when many parents are working from home without child care The guidelines were never issued with the apocalypse in mind he says Instead he recommends parents limit preschoolers screen time to four hours a day Of all the age groups preschool has a fair amount of highquality educational programming says Dr Christakis who is also the director of the Center for Child Health Behavior and Development at Seattle Childrens Research Institute He suggests that parents use guides like those from Common Sense Media a nonprofit that recommends ageappropriate entertainment to choose content and talk to children about what they have seen and learned For elementaryschoolers Dr Christakis suggests limiting recreational screen time not including whats necessary for online learning to three hours a day Given parental needs in this situation we should be willing to be fairly lax about these things he says For middle school and high school Dr Christakis says to make sure tweens and teens are spending at least four hours a day away from screens not including sleep time There should be no screen time during meals and for at least one hour before bedtime Kids still need a social life Between social media and multiplayer gaming older children and teens tend to have a lot of experience connecting with their friends digitally But younger children need to spend time with their friends in this new world too Young people really rely on social connections Not having it over time can have an effect on mood and selfesteem says Dr Rialon Berry Parents can arrange virtual playdates using Google Hangouts or Zoom Dr Lenger Kang is helping her 13yearold son set up an online Dungeons  Dragons club with his friends Dr Donahue the child psychologist says responsible teens also could take walks togetheras long as they stay 6 feet apart as publichealth officials recommend Some time alone is good too Kids especially teens still need some physical and psychological space With families suddenly spending so much time together a spike in squabbles is probably inevitable especially among siblings It is important for each child to spend some time alone to decompress says Dr Rialon Berry For siblings who share a room she suggests that each child gets at least 30 minutes a day in their room alone to do what they want Many teenagers are used to a certain amount of physical freedom They may have had cars jobs and liberal curfews Now they might be chafing at new rules and saddened by their loss of freedom We have to recognize that they too are experiencing stress and strain says Nathaniel Beers a pediatrician at Childrens National Hospital in Washington DC Parents should give them privacy to connect with their friends and vent to their community he says Brad Sachs a family psychologist in Columbia Md says parents can help teens who are rattling the cage for more independence by encouraging their social consciousness and sense of altruism Suggest that they offer to pick up groceries for a senior or that they communicate with an isolated family member through FaceTime Says Dr Sachs Those concrete actions tend to take the edge off that loss of autonomy Ms Petersen is a reporter for The Wall Street Journal in New York She can be reached at andreapetersenwsjcom Selected activities for

created to fight against the coronavirus pandemic The lowsleep highoctane sessions have attracted participants worldwide to team up online and suggest solutions to problems such as the equipment shortage for health providers or a better way to track the spread of Covid19 the respiratory disease caused by the virus Everyone is looking at the urgency of the situation said Youseph Yazdi executive director at Johns Hopkins Center for Bioengineering Innovation and Design which organized a fiveday hackathon in the last week of March that attracted 513 teams with 2331 applicants from 34 countries That hackathon was around thematic areas including how to communicate effectively about Covid19 prevention of transmission within communities and healthcare equipment shortages Among the ideas that emerged were a locationbased mobile application to track traffic in grocery stores for effective socialdistancing practices and a tool for messaging platforms to tag misinformation by analyzing keywords and redirecting users to trusted news sources It was the first hackathon for Helen Xun a medical student on leave from Johns Hopkins whose team reviewed and refined design files of 3D printed parts such as filters and splitters so ventilators could be shared among multiple patients The team had already prototyped parts ahead of the hackathon but got fresh ideas on designs and materials The hackathon opened this international forum for us to talk to people globally to assess the actual needs Ms Xun said Hackathons were made popular decades ago by the software community as communal allnight sessions often powered by pizza and various caffeinated beverages Social distancing means todays hackathons are conducted online with interactions among team members happening over videoconferencing and chat tools fromnnnnnnnnnnn            Zoom Video Communicationsnnn      andnnnnnnnnnnn            Slack Technologies Inc The rapid spread of the coronavirus which caught many officials flatfooted has paved the way for communitysourced solutions ranging from hackathons to 3D printing Doctors are leading the fight but a lot of people would love to find ways to engage and help said Sam Lessin a general partner at venturecapital firm Slow Ventures which helped organize a hackathon last month with about 19000 participants from across 175 countries working on themes suggested by partners such as the World Health Organization Hackathon participants are expected to experiment to find solutions making such events better equipped to tackle aspects of complex problems said Estonias Minister of Trades Kaimar Karu More than 1000 people from around 20 countries participated in a remote hackathon that the Estonia government and local companies organized last month Theres no known way out of this he said You can only try experiment at a small scale and based on the results you can amplify this If it doesnt work at all you essentially kill the idea he said Last weekend Massachusetts Institute of Technology hosted a 48hour Beat the Pandemic hackathon in which 1500 participants worked in 238 teams Rebecca Sereda a researcher in the stemcell and regenerativebiology department at Harvard University was part of a team that in 40 hours created a mobile app that used machine learning to score individuals on immunity to Covid19 similar to a credit score based on data such as location age interactions and health history The team is refining the app and preparing to launch it It was extremely chaotic because people are constantly messaging theres a million notifications going at once from all these different Slack channels Ms Sereda said about the experience MIT provided access to open data sets including JHUs epidemiological data repository and Covid19 information compiled by the World Health Organization and the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention We had many partners from the healthcare space and clinical partners involved It is up to them to work with the teams to take the solutions developed and work toward putting those in market said Paul Cheek a hackerinresidence at Martin Trust Center for MIT

for a Congressional investigation into the United Nations agencys role in helping Communist China cover up information regarding the threat of the Coronavirus The rot at WHO goes beyond canoodling with Beijing but thats a good place to start The coronavirus outbreak began in Wuhan China sometime in the autumn perhaps as early as November It accelerated in December Caixin Global reported that

that they had seen evidence that the virus could be transmitted humantohuman But the agency bowing to Beijing doesnt have a normal relationship with Taiwan On Jan 14 WHO tweeted Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of humantohuman transmission The agency took another week to reverse that misinformation On Jan 2223 a WHO emergency committee debated whether to declare Covid19 a public health emergency of international concern The virus already had spread to several countries and making such a declaration would have better

congratulated for the extraordinary measures it has taken he said I left in absolutely no doubt about Chinas commitment to transparency A University of Southampton study suggests the number of coronavirus cases could have been reduced by 95 had China moved to contain the virus three weeks sooner Yet Dr Tedros gushed that Beijing had set a new standard for outbreak response He also praised the speed with which China sequenced the genome and shared it with WHO and the world China didnt do so until Jan 12 On Jan 30 Dr Tedros also said that WHO doesnt recommend limiting trade and movement Presidentnnnnnnnnnn      n      Trumpnnnn      ignored the advice and announced travel restrictions on China the following day slowing the spread of the virus US progressive elites echoed WHO and

investors with a confounding reality soaring share prices and a floundering economy The explosive rally is a sign that many are positioning for the US to make a speedy recovery when the coronavirus crisis eases Investors have been encouraged in recent days by signs that several states will move to resume business along with hopes that a viable treatment for Covid19 could be near The bluechip index rose 22 this week extending its rally over the past two weeks to 15its best performance since 1938 The SP 500 climbed 3 this week while the Nasdaq Composite surged 61 as investors piled into highflying technology stocks The Dow and SP 500 are still down more than 10 for the year while the Nasdaqs losses have been cut to 36 Many investors agree the most important driver of the rebound has been the Federal Reserves massive stimulus plan combined with the efforts of the US government which sent a signal that both were willing to step in like never before to buoy the economy US stocks bottomed March 23 after the Fed cut rates to nearzero They took away the depression That scenario is out of the picture now said Zhiwei Ren a portfolio manager at Penn Mutual Asset Management The Fed is the fundamental reason for the rebound The central bank also unleashed a massive program to buy Treasurys and mortgagebacked securities while President Trump signed a roughly 2 trillion stimulus package the biggest relief package in US history For some investors it doesnt pay to bet against stocks after the Fed stepped in The stimulus spurred a fear of missing out among investors and gave many the confidence to resurrect some of the most popular tactics of recent yearsbuying dips in the stock market and piling into shares of big technology companies The coronavirus toll on the population and the economy has been dour More than 150000 people around the globe have died while cases worldwide have topped 2 million In the US more than 22 million Americans have sought unemployment benefits in recent weeks Retail sales a measure of purchases at stores gasoline stations restaurants bars and online fell by a seasonally adjusted 87 in March from a month earlier the most severe decline since recordkeeping began in 1992 Earnings for the first quarter among big US companies are expected to decline nearly 15 from a year earlier according to FactSet which would mark

strategy has been analyzing reams of data on the spread of the pandemic around the globe looking at hospitalization rates and resources like hospital beds for clients He expects US stocks to be back at highs in the first half of next year Why Going against the Federal Reserve is typically a losing battle he said The Feds latest move reinforces our view of a full asset price recovery and equity markets reaching alltime highs next year Mr Kolanovic said in a recent note Investors with a focus on negative upcoming earnings and economic developments are effectively fighting the Fed which was historically a losing proposition There may be limits to that approach other analysts said For example a 350 billion smallbusiness loan program from the US government has already exhausted its funding highlighting the mammoth challenge that lawmakers faceand sheer amount of cash necessaryto support the economy and keep Americans employed These types of loans can be forgiven if firms dont lay off workers but US lawmakers have recently struggled to agree on the next round of coronavirus emergency aid Despite the stimulus checks going to Americans around the country measures by the central bank and government cant alter human behavior and force people to leave their homes eat at restaurants shop at malls and go to movies That has led some analysts to say a recovery may take longer than many are currently anticipating How long before you and I are going to feel comfortable going to a concert again said Dominic Nolan a senior managing director at Pacific Asset Management which oversees roughly 12 billion in debt A government program doesnt really help that Mr Nolan said that he has recently bought bonds of investmentgrade companies after the Federal Reserves recent moves Some investors are still anxious because the bond market is sending a more cautious signal Investors have continued scooping up traditionally safe assets like government bonds and gold as stocks have rallied The yield on the 10year Treasury note has fallen to 0655 from 126 in midMarch as bond prices have risen while gold prices hit their highest level in more than seven years this week The concurrent gains across traditionally risky and safe assets alike suggest that many remain concerned about an extended downturn Investors have also treated some corners of the stock market as a hiding place piling into the technology darlings that powered markets higher in recent years The Nasdaq is trading like a safe haven in a way Mr Ren of Penn Mutual Asset Management said Amazoncom Incnnn      andnnnnnnnnnnn            Netflix Incnnn      both surged at least 14 this week and set records while some of the momentumdriven trades that were popular earlier in the year also reemergednnnnnnnnnnn

small residential recovery program in Atlanta that for 15 years has helped homeless women get past addictions and into jobs and housing She was losing a battle with an opioid addiction started by a prescription painkiller and says she doesnt know where shed be if she hadnt gotten into Gilgal where she had a year of counseling and coaching on resumes and job interviews as well as budgeting and health insurance Theres no telling says the working mother who now lives in Winder Ga with her two young sons and her mother There are only a few ways I couldve gone Now Covid19 threatens Gilgals future The nonprofit has been forced to cancel two of its three fundraising events a spring luncheon and a 15year anniversary celebration in May Its Blue Jean gala in October is up in the air Together the three events would have funded between a third and half the charitys 600000 annual operating budget some of its donors are hurting too If the crisis continues Gilgal will have to cut back on half of its programs the tutoring coaching and mentoring women into the workforce with life skills they need to succeed like budgeting and managing a household Gilgal would have to cut staff too It would no longer be able to manage the army of volunteer groups that are a large part of its business model If we continue in this Covid crisis then whats really happening is Im crippled says Val Cater the charitys founder and executive director Across the country nonprofits of all types and sizes are in trouble They have canceled major fundraisers They have lost huge amounts of ticket and event revenue Those with government contracts dread what will happen when their fiscal year ends June 30 Demand for services especially at food banks is outpacing revenue Most charities operate on razorthin margins even in good times Nonprofits are subject to tight restrictions in most government contracts Charities are penalized if they dont keep costs down by the benchmarking firms that donors consult to decide if charities are run well In a survey of 3400 nonprofits two years ago half said they had only three months cash on hand or less 19 said they had a month or less according to the Nonprofit Finance Fund a New Yorkbased lender that conducted the survey The system sets them up to be fragile saysnnnnnnnnnn      n      Antony BuggLevinennnn      CEO of the Nonprofit Finance Fund The virusrelated revenue disruption is an unprecedented calamity for nonprofits he says He predicts many will collapse Nonprofits hurt by the pandemic include venerable ones like the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco which include the de Young museum and the Legion of Honor The organization is governed by three nonprofit boards and one of them is a department of the city and county This is critical read the subject line of a lateApril email to the organizations members It faces a projected loss of 9 million in revenue on lost admissions canceled events and two major fundraisers It has an annual operating budget of 62 million Most though are smaller nonprofits like Gilgal Ninetytwo percent of the nations 901206 nonprofits that filed annual returns with the IRS for 2016 had annual budgets of less than 1 million according to a 2019 report by the National Council of Nonprofits Most are communitybased and focused on a local need How are you offering support to those in need during this crisis Join the conversation below Many have been destabilized even though the services they provide are needed now more than ever Our survivors and their children are trapped at home saysnnnnnnnnnn      n      Jeehae Fischernnnn      executive director of New Yorkbased Korean American Family Service Center The agency aids immigrant survivors of domestic violence and child abuse Calls to its emergency helpline on some days more than quadrupled Some are calling to say they are hungry My heart aches I know we need to do more says Ms Fischer But it had to cancel its April fundraiser recently it has been close to not making its payroll she says But its July that Im really worried about she says She knows the agencys funding from contracts with the hardhit New York City and state will be cut In Los Angeles children are in lockdown and cant get to the Helpline Youth Counseling Center The agencys government fundingwhich makes up about 85 of its operating budget which was about 67 million last yeardepends on the amount of counseling it delivers Directornnnnnnnnnn      n      Jeff Farbernnnn      worries his funding will be cut even though the communitys problems have multiplied We know that abuse hasnt stopped he says The dealers are still out there As the virus has sapped revenue for nonprofits it has also been a double whammy in driving up their costsfor masks cleaning supplies technology and foodwhich further restricts how many people they can reach The challenges faced at Gilgal are similar to those many of the countrys smaller nonprofits are now dealing with A 60000 loan from the federal Paycheck Protection Program ensures that for three months Gilgal wont have to cut staff But it is meant to protect jobs not sustain an organization says Ms Cater She has applied to several funding sources but is realistic about the odds I know foundations are being flooded by organizations like Gilgal so it really is a wait and see situation right now she says Hope and pray and wait and see Much of the nonprofits food was donated by Hollywood film crews until the virus made it impossible to shoot films in Atlanta Gilgal usually has 25 women at a time rotating through various parts of the program Currently the number is 11 The charity isnt accepting newcomerseven those approved and on its waiting listuntil it can ensure the safety of residents and staff I really hate that saysnnnnnnnnnn      n      Deborah Moorennnn      who is in charge of the agencys intake and case management She went through five addiction recovery programs including Gilgals twice before shaking her cocaine habit One thing about me I have compassion for women who need help Right now they need help she says The agency is doing its best to keep the program on track Ms Moore holds individual casemanagement meetings by phone She teaches relapse prevention and anger management classes on speaker phone But the virus has put a halt to much of what makes Gilgal hands on During normal times the women get a parade of visiting experts and volunteersstudents at the Georgia State University School of Nursing who teach about health Morehouse College business students who coach career planning resumes and a 30second elevator pitch church groups and sorority groups Volunteers come to explain budgeting saving and benefits What is a 401k because whatever it is I got one today Ms Cater recalls a resident saying after her first day at a hospital job In normal times the women are shepherded into jobs and often housing with the help of a web of relationships forged by Ms Cater with agencies like the United Way and companies like thennnnnnnnnnn            United Parcel Servicennn      and CKS Packaging both based in Atlanta CKS Packagings vice presidentnnnnnnnnnn      n      Drew Sewellnnnn      says the Gilgal women come wellprepared many have become lifelong employees At Ms Powerss global staffing company she was just promoted She never dreamed shed have savings and be able to give her 11yearold an allowance I just have this joy in my heart I never had before she says Ms Cater hopes she can keep Gilgal going If she cant make up for the lost revenue then everything is on the table she says Were just a small nonprofit Were a debtfree organization Even with that it is a difficult landscape to look into and not have a handle on what the future holds Here are some ways to find charities in need and a few that are serving those particularly hit hard by the pandemic Local foundations The Community Foundation has information on local nonprofits needs and projects

the de Young museum and the Legion of Honor has a 62 million annual budget and faces a projected 9 million revenue shortfall due to lost admissions canceled events and two major fundraisers An earlier

months of shutdowns designed to curb the contagion Slight declines in new confirmed cases in some states have prompted governors from New York to Ohio to restart some services with rules varying from place to place including restaurants churches and schools On Wednesday Connecticut became one of the last states to loosen restrictions Washington DC remains under stayathome orders and large parts of states including major metropolitan areas are still largely shut In most states the reopenings are happening in phases Absent mandated federal guidelines local leaders looking to reopen have weighed the potential costs to the economy and public health relying on sources including virus data task forces publichealth leaders and their own constituencies A big question remaining is whether cases will go up as people reemerge Most states are moving to reopen before they have met criteria set by the Trump administration such as a twoweek decline in the number of new cases or in the percentage of Covid19 tests that are positive The administrations plan leaves the decision about when to reopen up to governors Two statesMichigan and New Mexicohad met the criteria as of May 18 according to Covidexitstrategyorg a tracking system run by a group of publichealth and crisis experts A few other states met the criteria in previous days but dropped back due to rising cases or declines in testing The daily number of positive tests for Covid19 the disease caused by the virus has risen or remained flat over the past two weeks in 24 states according to Covidexitstrategyorg a worrying sign for a disease that is highly transmissible and can cause deadly complications from head to toe The disease is more contagious and deadlier than the flu according to public health data from several countries More than 155 million people in the US have confirmed cases of the coronavirus and over 93000 deaths have been recorded according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University including 1485 between 8 pm Tuesday and the same time Wednesday according to a Wall Street Journal analysis Worldwide there are some 496 million confirmed infections and more than 326000 reported deaths Experts caution that official numbers likely understate the extent of the pandemic in part because of limited and differing testing capabilities for the virus Covid19 can cause damage far beyond the lungs affecting the brain kidneys heart vascular and digestive systems Some patients have sudden strokes pulmonary emboli or kidney failure Children have developed an inflammatory condition resembling Kawasaki disease Some people even develop Covid toe a painful purplish swelling caused by blood clots About 10 to 20 of people who are infected become severely ill and can develop such complications according to public health data though more populationwide testing is needed to determine the true percentage Publichealth officials fear a new wave of illnesses if states reopen too broadly a move

sectors of the economy prevent transmission Other public health experts are weighing in too Resolve to Save Lives a nonprofit initiative of the global health organization Vital Strategies released a

increased testing capabilities and robust contacttracing programs are necessary for safely easing restrictions But changing and often inconsistent information has hampered efforts to create a clear

only precedent for its rapid spread to every continent killing people everywhere and devastating both local economies and world trade was the flu pandemic of 191819 In both cases the germs behind the pandemic werent especially lethal Covid19 and the flu both fall within the normal range of mild infectious diseases Compared with smallpox and Ebola they kill only a small percentage of their victims and their persontoperson transmissibility isnt unusual What sets them apartwhat has made them worldwide pandemicsis modern transportation fast steamships for the flu and now jet airplanes for Covid19 Of course there have been a great many mere epidemics in human history diseases that have spread more slowly over large areas but their effects have been profound Over the course of recorded history and now in the archaeological record examples abound of germs producing high death tolls and social and political upheaval with farreaching effects on local economies trade migration colonization and conquest Will Covid19 transform our own era too Are we entering an age of pandemics It is far too early to say but the long history of germs as agents of historical change can provide needed perspectiveand perhaps a window into how Covid19 and its likely successors may shape our destiny for good and ill Consider first a familiar case the plague bacterium which was transmitted from rodents to humans by fleas and spread from Asia into Europe in the 14th century The Black Death killed about a third of Europes population in the years 134751 and recurred with lower death tolls for many decades thereafter n        The Black Death forced landowners to start paying their tenants and to grant them more rightsn         Its immediate effect on Western Europes economy and trade was disastrous Paradoxically though its longterm effect was positive By reducing the number of laborers the Black Death forced landowners to start paying their tenants and to grant them more rights and freedoms Societies became less rigidly stratified nuclear families became stronger and sanitation and quarantines developed to combat infectious diseases Europeans werent the plagues only victims In Central Asia it had a big effect on historys largest land empire the Mongol Empire which stretched from China to Persia and Russia By cutting off travel and trade plague severed connections between the empires parts thereby causing Mongol control of Persia and China to collapse in 1335 and 1368 respectively and control of Russia to wither away slowly Tropical diseases have had similarly profound effects Only after quinine was found to be effective in treating malaria for instance could Europeans embark on their colonial conquests in New Guinea and Africa carving up territories where European settlement had been impossible before Why before quinine were Europeans unable to establish themselves in New Guinea and Africa where indigenous peoples had been thriving for hundreds of thousands of years Because different peoples have different susceptibilities to the same diseasea major theme of medical history Over thousands of years of exposure to malaria New Guineans and Africans evolved many forms of genetic resistance through natural selection Northern Europeans by contrast had no history of exposure to malaria hadnt evolved any of those genetic protections and hence were unlikely to survive long enough to develop antibodies The most lethal permanent and farreaching effect of germs in recorded history was to aid the European conquest and extensive replacement of Native Americans Pacific Islanders and Aboriginal Australians This was the reverse of what happened in Africa and New Guinea where local diseases and differential susceptibilities enabled local peoples for a time to resist European invaders Perhaps the deadliest germ that Europeans brought with them was smallpox The disease killed Europeans too of course but through natural selection over thousands of years of exposure they had evolved partial genetic resistance They also had acquired immunity by developing antibodies In the centuries before vaccination was developed smallpox was widespread in Europe and almost everyone was exposed in childhood when some died but most survived and remained immune thereafter When smallpox was brought by Europeans to the New World all Native Americans of all ages lacked antibodies and the mortality rate was high especially among adults In 1837 for example when a steamship on the Missouri River accidentally introduced smallpox to a village of 2000 previously unexposed Mandan Indians all but 40 of the villagers died within a few weeks We often think of European settlers taking up arms to dispossess or kill Native Americans In fact most Native Americans died in bed of European diseases leaving only a fraction to be defeated by guns on the battlefield The most consequential of these outbreaks were the smallpox epidemics that struck the New Worlds most powerful states the empires of the Aztecs and Incas The disease killed their emperors Cuitlhuac and Huayna Capac and millions of their subjects making possible the conquests of Corts andnnnnnnnnnn      n      Pizarro But this familiar history raises a question Why didnt Native Americans like Africans have diseases of their own to which they had some genetic and acquired resistanceand which could have killed off invading Europeans n        Covid19 AIDS SARS MERS Ebola and Marburg are all diseases of animals n         The answer is relevant to understanding Covid19 and other new diseases that have emerged over the past 40 yearsAIDS SARS MERS Ebola and Marburg All of them are zoonoses that is diseases of animals They reach humans from wild animals with which we came into close contact through hunting and animal markets We now know that thousands of years ago animals were also the source of our major epidemic infectious diseases smallpox measles influenza tuberculosis and others The diseases infected us from domestic animals such as cattle pigs and camels with which we come into much closer more frequent and more prolonged contact than with wild animals It all began around 10000 years ago when people began to domesticate livestock Almost all of our livestock were domesticated in Eurasia from Eurasian wild ancestors The only large animal domesticated in the New World was the llama which didnt infect us because we dont milk or cuddle llamas as we do cows and calves or sheep and lambs That is why the major epidemic diseases of history have all been Eurasian diseases Compared with Eurasia the Americas were a healthy environment and Native Americans a healthy people until Europeans arrived bringing their livestockderived diseases That is also why Native Americans lacked their own equivalent of smallpox to give back to Europeans As scientists have recently discovered similar deadly encounters also happened long before written history could record them Archaeologists have found abundant evidence of nomadic horsemounted herders from the Asian steppes reaching Eastern Europe in prehistoric times Those herders were the predecessors of the Huns the Mongols and other steppe invaders who terrorized Europe over the past two millennia In recent years geneticists analyzing ancient skeletons have found the DNA of steppe peoples appearing widely over Europe and partly replacing the DNA of Europes ancient farmers But how could these horsemounted nomads have successfully invaded Europes forests where their horses would have been of limited military value Those same forests deprived the Huns and Mongols of their military advantage so how could their ancient predecessors have succeeded where Attila andnnnnnnnnnn      n      Genghis Khannnnn      failed Prehistoric European skeletons have revealed an agent of conquest more potent than horses DNA of the bacterium causing plague So perhaps steppe invaders didnt kill ancient European farmers just with bows and arrows A troop of plaguebearing nomads riding into a European farming community would have had an effect like that of a Missouri River steamship with a smallpox patient arriving at a Mandan Indian village in 1837 This discovery may also contribute to answering the biggest unresolved question of historical linguistics the wide distribution today of IndoEuropean languages all closely related to each other from India all the way west to Ireland from Hindi and Russian to English and Spanish Linguists and archaeologists studying the differences among these languages suggest that the IndoEuropean family expanded only within the last 10000 years Biologically modern Homo sapiens has occupied all of Europe for at least the last 30000 years however since the extinction of the Neanderthals Surely the modern humans who created the great cave paintings at Lascaux in France spoke fully modern human languages and didnt just grunt Yet the only nonIndoEuropean language remaining in Western Europe today is the Basque language of the Pyrenees  One has to wonder whether languages related to Basque were the languages of Europes first farmers most of whose languages were replaced by the IndoEuropean languages spoken by plagueinfected steppe nomads around 5000 years ago If so plague may help to explain why this article is published today in English rather than in a language related to Basque Were germs also involved in some of the other great replacements of the prehistoric past At least two prominent cases cry out for study First as we know from their appearance genes languages and archaeological remains the farming peoples now living in tropical Southeast AsiaVietnamese Thais Malays Indonesians Filipinos and otherscame originally from South China and Taiwan But ancient skeletons show that until around 3000 BC the region was occupied by huntergatherers related to modern New Guineans and Aboriginal Australians Another intriguing case Almost all modern peoples of subequatorial Africa today are blacks who speak Bantu languages closely related to the languages of West African farmers Again though all subequatorial African peoples until around 2000 years ago were huntergatherers similar to the few surviving subequatorial huntergatherer groups of Pygmies and Khoisan peoples How do you think Covid19 will change history Join the conversation below Both in Southeast Asia and in subequatorial Africa archaeologists have assumed that denser populations and superior technology were what enabled Chinese or West African farmers to replace the indigenous huntergatherers While that is undoubtedly part of the story Id suggest that the germs of the invading farmers and their domestic animals likely played a role too infecting huntergatherers who had had no exposure to those diseases What do the histories of these early epidemics tell us about the pandemic that the world is now enduring One obvious conclusion is that Covid19 is certain to have successors Over the past 10000 years we humans acquired most of our infectious diseases from domestic animals The main source of new diseases in recent decades has been largescale contact with wild animals China has closed its wild animal markets in response to Covid19 but other points of contact remain wild animal markets in other countries the use of wild animals for traditional medicines and the African trade in bushmeat As long as those routes remain open were likely to see more diseases like Covid19 in the near future And many of them will probably become pandemics because of jet planes and other forms of mass travel Covid19 has circled the globe in a matter of months the Black Death of the Middle Ages lacked the means to spread so widely Finally there is the issue of who is suffering most from Covid19 The big killers of history and prehistory have involved differential mortality peoples with some genetic and acquired protection from previous exposure who then infected and caused mass mortality among previously unexposed peoples with no protection At first it might seem that this doesnt hold true for Covid19 After all the disease has existed for less than a year No one had genetic protection or antibodies to protect them which is why Covid19 is killing people all around the world n        Covid19 may increase inequality within and between countriesn         But as we all know by now there is differential mortality with Covid19 it just has nothing to do with preexisting genetic resistance or antibodies Were seeing big differences in mortality between population groups in the USbetween poor Native Americans and AfricanAmericans for example and other Americansrelated to differences in preexisting health conditions Were seeing even bigger differences among American states lower mortalities in Montana than in New York and among countries much lower mortalities in New Zealand Germany and Vietnam than in Italy and the US because of differences in geography and government policy When Covid19 reaches its peak in India and Africa we are likely to see further disparities related to differences in national wealth and healthcare systems Covid19 may thus increase inequality within and between countries Inequality was causing big problems before the pandemic of course but now thanks to modern travel and globalization it means that poor unhealthy infected people will remain sources of reinfection for wealthy healthy people A challenge for the future will be to ensure that face masks vaccines treatments and ventilators become available to everyone in the world If they dont become available we shall all remain vulnerable If they do become available that global response to a global problem may inspire other global responses to other global problems That would be a delayed benefit of the Covid19 tragedy Mr Diamond a professor of geography at the University of California Los Angeles is

Ticket prices are expected to fall Here nine factors shaping the postCovid concert Neither artists nor fans like halffull concerts no matter the venue But in the months ahead artists with less expensive stage showscountry performers rappers comediansmay perform for say 600 fans in a 1800seat venue if necessary for social distancing And instead of performing one big show artists might perform multiple ones says Rob Light head of music at talent agency CAA As for major arena actsthe kind whose shows involve elaborate productionssome could temporarily downsize to smaller theaters or amphitheaters Coachella the worlds highestgrossing festival remains scheduled for October but toptier summer and fall events continue to be rescheduled On Tuesday a stadium tour by Weezer Green Day and Fall Out Boy was postponed to summer 2021 The logical places to open first are the smaller openair ones says Jonathan Daniel cofounder of Crush Music a management firm whose clients include Weezer Green Day Fall Out Boy and Sia Would you go to a concert now If not what would make you feel comfortable about attending one Join the discussion below After years of soaring pricesAriana Grande BTS and Post Malone each charged over 100 a ticket on average last year while the Rolling Stones cost more than 200concertgoers can expect them to fall a little When the livemusic business experienced a huge economic shock in 2008 the average ticket price went down 5 to 8 for three years straight says Rick Mueller president of North America for AEG Presents the worlds No 2 concert promoter Now superstars who were charging skyhigh prices may lower them others may expand lowercost options like lawn seats while keeping their priciest seats high There could be special deals for groups like nurses says CAAs Mr Light At the same time arena acts now playing theaters could charge more for the intimate experience It feels like its ground zero says Mike Luba a liveevents producer and artist manager We have to throw out everything weve assumed for the last few decades The lockdown has helped fuel innovationlook at rap star Travis Scotts brief concert in the multiplayer videogame Fortnite or experimentalpop duo 100 gecs Square Garden festival in the game Minecraft The most pioneering space has been in the hiphop world which has created novel online entertainment experiences Perhaps the most popular is the Verzuz series of beat battles on Instagram Live where hiphop legends play tracks they were involved in during a lighthearted competition For the most part music executives consider efforts like paid livestreams videogame appearances and drivein concerts to be oneoffs or novelties that let artists stay in touch with fans yet dont generate enough revenue to be meaningful to the industry Trying to play an actual concert online doesnt work really well Mr Daniel says However the Verzuz series shows the possibility of events that are uniquely suited to a digital medium experts say And some executives see the potential for business even after live music returns  Reopening the touring business is likely to be a patchwork affair with US cities and states and other countries having different requirements That will make routing tours a headache artist managers say If an artist cant easily string together 20 dates without interruptions including major hubs like New York they may just hold off For others who head out costs will be higher given additional spending on staff buses and hotels Its almost a little bit of Swiss cheese touring says Traci Thomas who manages artists including singersongwriter Jason Isbell One solution Some artists may perform miniresidencies in one venue or play regionally managers say Your favorite tiny clubthe kind of place where youre proud to say you saw an act before they got famouscould go under The National Independent Venue Association says 90 of its members may not survive if the shutdown lasts six months Ms Thomas scheduled a club tour into next year for Oklahoma artist John Moreland Fingers crossed that those venues stay open she says  The concert industry is already highly consolidated with Live Nation and AEG having taken over or partnered with many of the remaining independent promoters and venues in recent years Still if even fewer independents exist the worlds two biggest promoters have more leverage over artists Shows with reduced crowds arent possible in arenas or stadiums without concert promoters suffering huge losses executives say Thats because the cost of staging an arena concert is so high promoters depend heavily on ticket sales and concessions like beer food and parking to simply break even To open in earnest I think the business is going to have to look a lot like it looked before we came offline says AEGs Mr Mueller Hence the need for a vaccine or other procedures to eliminate health risks and ensure massive crowds The days of selfserve concession stands are over Music lovers will experience new protocols at venues for safety and sanitation especially around food and beverages bathrooms and elevators The way 9/11 changed our industry in terms of security this will lead to best practices that our touring industry is compelled to employ forever says Dave Brown chief operating officer of American Airlines Center a 20000capacity arena in Dallas Packaged foods will rule the day Staff will frequently clean hand railings Restroom capacities could be limited And there will be handsanitizer stations Youll be tripping over them Mr Brown says Temperature checks face masks and testing stations could become part of the concert experience at least for a while Back in the precorona days fans with deep pockets paid big bucks to meet with their favorite artists  Smaller artists also started to offer pricey VIP packages including meetandgreets that allow acts to maximize revenue from superfans But with social distancing it is likely few will feel the same about shaking hands I dont think youre going to see meetandgreets for a long time says AEGs Mr Mueller For smaller artists who often struggle to break even on tours that will make it harder to stay in the black For artists the crisis is changing how they are paid with more acts taking a major share of boxoffice proceeds instead of getting upfront payments from promoters executives say That protects the promoter if sales are disappointing or if huge refunds are doled out For superstars who sell out arenas it may not matter much but for smaller acts navigating a tough economy it makes touring riskier Everybody is going to be making a little less AEGs Mr Mueller says This is going to be a multiyear process to get our health back says CAAs  Mr Light But well come back Write to Neil Shah at neilshahwsjcom

headsets such asnnnnnnnnnnn            Microsoft Corpsnnn      HoloLens Companies for several years have been experimenting with early versions of the technology to design objects such as automobiles and to receive stepbystep manufacturing instructions The pandemic has increased those use cases to include remote assistance and training because employees and customers are less willing to be in close contact said JP Gownder vice president and principal analyst at Forrester Research Inc Since March Sheba Medical Center has used five HoloLens 2 headsets to train about 60 physicians biomedical engineers and nurses on how to operate ventilators for Covid19 patients said Ravid Segal chief technology officer of the MSR  The Israel Center for Medical Simulation located at Sheba Medical Center The HoloLens headset uses computer processing and optical projection systems to create digital hologramlike objects that users can see and interact with in their real environment The Morning Download delivers daily insights and news on business technology from the CIO Journal team In the Sheba Medical Center scenario medical workers wearing the headset can see a hologramlike rendering of a ventilator superimposed on their realworld view The headset includes builtin instructions that guide the worker through the process of operating the physical ventilator in front of them The headset can also be used as a way for doctors in other parts of the hospital to give remote assistance without needing to be physically present but still being able to see what is happening in a patients room Users wearing the headset can connect to a realtime video feed of a doctor in a separate wing of the hospital which is displayed to the user as a digital image floating in the realworld room The doctor using either a HoloLens headset or a mobile device can also see what the user is seeing in real time Before the pandemic the medical center had already planned to explore the use of augmented reality this year said Eyal Zimlichman chief innovation officer at Sheba Medical Center With Covid it reinforced our decision to use augmented reality and the understanding that this is a critical tool in health care Dr Zimlichman said Microsoft has seen a 13fold increase in remote assistance usage on HoloLens 2 since January largely because of socialdistancing and lockdown requirements amid the pandemic said Charlie Han principal program manager for Microsoft HoloLens The number of US employees expected to wear augmented and socalled mixed reality headsets is projected to reach 86 million by 2028 up from 25000 in 2019 according to a November 2019 report by Forrester The research firm refers to the virtual overlay of hologramlike interactive objects onto a users view of the real world as mixed reality while the term augmented reality refers to static images superimposed onto a users view of the real world Enterprise adoption of the technology could accelerate in the coming years as companies realize the value of the technology meaning the forecast could change Forresters Mr Gownder said We have seen a huge increase in enterprise interest in augmented and mixed reality during the pandemic he said in an email Broadband internet company Cox Communications in March rolled out augmented reality technology to its workforce of more than 5000 people including home technicians and contractors Its absolutely essential to how were operating said Len Barlik chief operations officer Customers who need help installing internet service plugging in a modem or setting up WiFi and passwords receive an email or text message with a link to start a virtual call through a software program from Alabamabased technology company Help Lightning Inc When customers click on the link using a phone or tablet with a builtin camera a technician can talk them through the setup process while being able to see what the customer is seeing The technician can draw a circle or arrow around a particular object such as a cable that the customer will be able to see Technicians normally have to go inside customers homes to perform such service or troubleshooting requests but the pandemic and socialdistancing requirements have prevented that from happening in various states Mr Barlik said Cox had explored the idea of using the technology in customer service experiments before this year but the pandemic accelerated the use case for it Mr Barlik said The Help Lightning technology is currently available only for residential customers but will continue to be used after the pandemic subsides and could be expanded to business customers he said Servicing customers via augmented reality can save the company money and time that would otherwise be spent on driving from house to house Mr Barlik said Well definitely continue to utilize it he said Help Lightning saw 435 growth in customers using its technology to conduct thousands of calls related to remote assistance

doctors to warn about the possibility of longterm addiction and abuse of the drugs Many physicians have a low threshold for prescribing them Its very problematic says Bruce J Schwartz deputy chair and professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Montefiore Medical Center in New York Many people do develop a dependency on these medications Prescriptions for antianxiety medications such as Klonopin and Ativan rose 102 in the US to 97 million in March 2020 from 88 million in March 2019 according to the latest data from healthresearch firm IQVIA Prescriptions for antidepressants including Prozac and Lexapro rose 92 to 297 million from 272 million in the same period The information doesnt include data on whether dosages have increased along with prescriptions n        If youve lost your

antidepressants in March and April 2020 compared with January and February Health concerns social isolation and the stress of job losses are taking a toll on peoples wellbeing More than onethird of Americans say the pandemic is having a serious impact on their mental health according to a survey released March 25 by the American Psychiatric Association Among parents with children under 18 46 rated their average stress level related to the pandemic as 8 9 or 10 on a 10point scale according to a survey the American Psychological Association released May 21 The nations top mentalhealth official recently warned that the suffering could deepen if there were a second coronavirus lockdown This kind of chronic stress brings about for all those people who have never had anxiety before it sort of overwhelms them says Charles B Nemeroff professor and chair of the department of psychiatry at Dell Medical School at the University of Texas at Austin and presidentelect of the Anxiety and Depression Association of America If youve lost your job if youre worried if youll have enough food for your kids that will keep you up at night And for those with a history of anxiety and depression stress can raise the risk of a relapse The most popular antianxiety medications are benzodiazepines that include Valium Xanax Ativan and Klonopin These drugs enhance the activity of the central nervous systems main inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA gammaaminobutyric acid GABAs primary function is to reduce the activity of neurons They are powerful and they are powerfully attractive in that they work instantly says James Potash director of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Johns Hopkins Medicine You take Ativan and 30 minutes later you are feeling dramatically less anxious Sleep medications like Lunesta and Ambien are similar to the benzodiazepines in that they also alter the activity of GABA The neurotransmitter is thought to facilitate sleep Doctors say that benzodiazepines can be a useful tool and are very effective for the shortterm treatment of acute anxiety Dr Potash advises patients to limit their use to weeks not months The problem he says is that people can quickly develop a tolerance to their effectssometimes in as little as two weekswhich can lead patients to increase the dose This is especially the case with the shorteracting drugs like Xanax which are also abused as street drugs The medications can be difficult to stop too Withdrawal symptoms can include a surge in anxiety tremors and in some cases seizures The medications can be particularly dangerous for older adults In seniors their use is associated with falls and cognitive problems Because benzodiazepines can reduce the bodys drive to breathe overdoses can be deadly That is especially true when they are combined with alcohol and opioids Overdose deaths involving benzodiazepines more than quadrupled between 1999 and 2013 according to a study published in 2016 in the American Journal of Public Health People can also develop a psychological dependence says Beth Salcedo a psychiatrist in Washington DC and the past president of the Anxiety and Depression Association of America If you have a boatload of Xanax and you are slightly anxious and you take one you feel better Next time you are anxious instead of taking care of what is making you anxious youre much more likely to reach for the Xanax she says It can very quickly become a habit Dr Salcedo recommends taking other steps to address anxiety including exercising eating well avoiding alcohol and making sure we surround ourselves with our social support as much as possible If anxiety is interfering with work or relationships she advises turning to the most evidencebased treatments for anxiety disorders which are cognitive behavioral therapy a type of talk therapy and antidepressant medications like Lexapro and Prozac Since it can take several weeks for the effects of antidepressant medication or therapy to kick in some doctors will use benzodiazepines briefly in the beginning of treatment to provide patients with immediate relief Doctors have some of the same concerns with common sleep medications like Ambien and Lunesta as they do with the benzodiazepines particularly when taken long term They can be dangerous when combined with alcohol and there are worries they can be addictive and abused The drugs also come with side effects like daytime drowsiness sometimes called the hangover effect For chronic sleep problems experts recommend first trying cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia known as CBTI It typically includes sleep restriction or limiting the amount of time people spend in bed when they are unable to sleep and stimulus control which means keeping the bedroom dedicated to sleep and sex Changing behavior is usually a healthier approach says Dr Potash It is pretty much all upside and very little downside Write to Andrea Petersen at andreapetersenwsjcom Have you felt increased

taken since midApril Three were positive and three were negative The contradictory resultsincluding two on the same day that came back with different answershave made it impossible for Mr Goldstein who is 74 years old to schedule a medical procedure his doctor recommended before the coronavirus pandemic began On May 12 he tested negative for the virus but the hospital requires another negative result before it goes ahead with the procedure to combat a longstanding kidney illness On Wednesday he went to a Department of Veterans Affairs hospital in Los Angeles for a seventh test He is still awaiting the results The testing situation is preventing my father from getting the care hes needed from the getgo said Mr Goldsteins son Amir With the increased testing capacity in the US and widespread availability of viral and antibody tests each day more Americans are trying to learn if they have or had Covid19 the disease caused by the new coronavirus But because some tests are unreliable or taken too early during the course of the disease the results arent consistent That can produce bad data for authorities and confusion among people who just want to know if they have the new coronavirus and might be contagious Situations like this are occurring with distressing frequency and are confusing to patients and their doctors saidnnnnnnnnnn      n      Robert Wachternnnn      chairman of the department of medicine at the University of California San Francisco The stakes of such confusion are rising as all 50 states are in the midst of easing lockdown restrictions and allowing local businesses to reopen Authorities rely on testing data to decide how quickly and broadly to end social distancing restrictions In addition some employers are requiring staff particularly those who were once symptomatic to be tested before returning People also need to know if it is safe to spend time with family and friends without fear of infecting them There are two types of Covid19 tests both of which reveal different information viral tests diagnose a current infection while antibody blood tests determine whether a person previously had the new coronavirus In the rush to roll out both types dozens of tests by various manufacturers have proven unreliable Beyond possible flaws in the tests themselves said Dr Wachter both viral and antibody Covid19 tests can occasionally be wrong because of timerelated issuesa patient is too early into the disease to develop enough of the virus or antibodies In late March Stephanie Zeidenweber had telltale symptoms of Covid19 shortness of breath body aches and chills The Florida residents initial test taken within days of her first symptoms came back negative Weeks into her illness she was still gasping for air and suffering from migraines A second test was also negative After her symptoms subsided she tried to get antibody tests to check again if she had had the coronavirus and ended up with two on the same day April 30 One reported she had the antibodies and thus had been infected the other said she didnt Ms Zeidenweber has remained in isolation at home with her husband and three children since March She hasnt seen her parents or returned to her job as a communications director at a realestate development project Not having answers has forced us to take drastic measures she said I dont know where I truly stand For Danielle Fried returning to her job as a therapy consultant shouldnt have posed a problem The 36yearold New Yorker tested positive for the virus last month She went into quarantine and her symptoms subsided Soon afterward she tested positive for antibodies indicating that she no longer had an active infection On May 12 Ms Fried visited an urgentcare center for a new test which her job required before she could return To her surprise she tested positive for an active Covid19 infection for the second time Everything we know about viruses is that youre not contagious after you have antibodies she said after receiving the new results The staffer couldn't explain why Ms Fried tested positive and said she probably wasnt contagious But Ms Fried said her employer didnt feel safe After the May 12 test she went back into quarantine for another two weeks Id like some direction Ms Fried said of the contradictory test results Theres so much fear and theres no science Have you received confusing

business practices abroad has long been a sore point for some in France Now Frances top law enforcement official has released guidance suggesting that it could adopt an approach to corporate corruption and bribery championed by the country it once criticized The French Ministry of Justice this month sent a memo to prosecutors outlining how it plans to investigate and prosecute illegal bribes paid by French companies to secure business in foreign countries The techniques and tools outlined closely resemble the ones used for nearly two decades in the US where prosecutors have tried to encourage companies to detect and voluntarily disclose allegations of bribery and reward the ones that do with more lenient settlements and discounts on fines The memo even hints that French prosecutors may do exactly what many in the country found so controversial about the US approach They could prosecute foreign companies for misconduct in countries outside of France even if the companies have only tenuous links to France The USs practice of prosecuting French companies has long riled members of Frances political and business establishments In the mid2000s the US Department of Justice began actively enforcing the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act an antibribery law that prohibits the payment of bribes by companies with ties to the US Our Morning Risk Report features insights and news on governance risk and compliance The enforcement effort wasnt just focused on American companies US prosecutors secured hundreds of millions of dollars in fines against a number of French companies including transportation companynnnnnnnnnnn            Alstom SAnnn      and oil and gas companynnnnnnnnnnn            Total SAnnn       Last year a member of Frances parliament wrote a report that addressed the issue arguing that France needed to develop legal tools to protect its companies from laws in other countries that target extraterritorial conduct Meanwhile France has taken strides toward strengthening its own anticorruption regime The country created a dedicated unit of prosecutors to handle cases of major economic crime It also passed a new anticorruption law known as Sapin II which requires French companies or subsidiaries of a certain size to maintain compliance programs and internal controls to prevent crimes But the memo issued June 2 which was signed by French Minister of Justicennnnnnnnnn      n      Nicole Belloubetnnnn      may be the strongest signal yet that France is looking to start policing its own companies with tools popularized by the US Its a very important policy and political signal said Nicola Bonucci a managing director at law firm Paul Hastings LLP in Paris The guidance is a way to say to the rest of the world including to the US From now on the French are going to take care of misconduct by French companies Language in the Sapin II law has long indicated that prosecutors could target foreign companies that carry out part of their business locally as US prosecutors do How much extraterritorial reach the law gave France has been unclear according to Mr Bonucci who was previously director of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Developments Working Group on Bribery But the recent memo by Ms Belloubet seems to suggest that prosecutors could apply the law broadly stating that even a company or subsidiary that wasnt legally incorporated in France could be prosecuted as long as it had some type of office or commercial footprint The anticorruption law introduced a type of settlement agreementcalled la convention judiciaire dintrt public or CJIP in Francethat allows companies to pay fines and resolve alleged misconduct without admitting liability similar to what is known as a deferred prosecution agreement in the US Ms Belloubets memo lays out factors prosecutors should consider when deciding whether to offer a company a CJIP including whether or not the company had selfdisclosed the infraction and how cooperative it had been A footnote in the memo even references and adopts the premise of a policy announced in the US by former Deputy Attorney Generalnnnnnnnnnn      n      Sally Yatesnnnn      which called on prosecutors to ensure that the employees of corporations responsible for wrongdoing are also held accountable Greater alignment between France the US and other countries such as the UK which adopted its own version of deferred prosecution agreements in 2014 could create greater collaboration among prosecutors That trend has already been playing out in France Earlier this year France the US and the UK announced a coordinated settlement withnnnnnnnnnnn            Airbus SEnnn      in which the European plane maker agreed to pay a combined 36 billion 4 billion to

for urgentcare walkin clinics has had to quickly build new tools to meet customer demands during the coronavirus pandemic The Machesney Park Ill company accelerated the development and launch of a telemedicine application and also built a feature to allow Covid19 patients to check in to their urgentcare appointments Both tools debuted in March We had to respond very quickly for our clients said David Stern Experitys chief executive Established to offer quick diagnoses and treatments to walkin patients urgentcare clinics have emerged as the first goto health resource for a growing number of Americans There are about 10000 urgentcare clinics nationwide according to the Urgent Care Association an industry group that represents about half of the clinics across the country Over the past several years many clinics have added more consumerfocused technology services such as the ability for patients to check in and manage their care via mobile app according to the association Earlier this year infection concerns forced clinics to shift their focus from inperson care toward telemedicine Experity which provides software for managing patient records electronic prescriptions insurance payments and billing to about 5700 clinics worked with an undisclosed vendor to develop a telemedicine application in two weeks The Morning Download delivers daily insights and news on business technology from the CIO Journal team The idea for a telemedicine app had already been in the works prior to the pandemic but the company initially aimed to launch it at the end of the year Dr Stern said Instead the company offered it to customers in March Other companies such asnnnnnnnnnnn            Teladoc Health Incnnn      and Doctor on Demand Inc have raced to add doctors and bandwidth for telemedicine services during the outbreak amid increased demand for the technology which struggled to take hold before the pandemic In late May about 85 of roughly 1100 urgentcare clinics were providing telemedicine services up from 29 in 2019 according to surveys and reports by the Urgent Care Association Urgentcare clinics have used Experity and other software vendors to provide those telemedicine services To date about 120000 patients have been seen via Experitys telemedicine app Dr Stern said The company also launched a Covid19 app for patients in March which was built in three days The app allows patients to answer questions about their symptoms and register for an appointment remotely without having to sit in the waiting room and potentially expose others to the virus We reverted to startup mode and that allowed us to really rapidly develop it Dr Stern said Experitys 40person product team worked with its dozens of software engineers to build both products while working remotely Working remotely has been relatively easy for the team he said Productivity measured by the amount of projects that each team builds and executes has increased by about 8 over the past three months he said Dr Stern said Experitys competitive advantage is that its software is purposebuilt for urgentcare clinics Patient data can be easily viewed in the software through charts and other visuals that physicians can use to quickly look up patient histories and treat them he said Templates also allow physicians to quickly process and document a patient visit he said Experity was formed from the 2019 merger of DocuTAP and Practice Velocity The company has 600 employees Because urgentcare clinics provide ondemand care they have unique needs when it comes to software said Laurel Stoimenoff chief executive of the Urgent Care Association For example they need to be able to quickly triage patients based on the severity of their medical conditions They also need to make quick diagnoses and software thats easy to use and intuitive allows them to expedite that process Software that helps prompt a clinical decision is helpful becausethe physician doesnt know your long medical history Ms Stoimenoff said Software and technology for urgentcare clinics have drastically improved over the past decade she said When she first joined the association in 2004 the majority of patient records were still paperbased and healthcare workers would sometimes have to pull them from storage units Xray records were stored on film instead of in digital formats which were fire hazards she said Now 86 of about 1000 urgentcare clinics have a mobile app that patients can use to manage their care according to an Urgent Care Association survey Thats up from about 54 that indicated they had an online checkin system either via website or mobile app about five years ago Ms Stoimenoff said Write to Sara Castellanos at saracastellanoswsjcom Copyright 2020 Dow Jones  Company Inc All Rights

Wednesday evening in the Oval Office with Wall Street Journal reporter Michael C Bender White House attendees included press secretarynnnnnnnnnn      n      Kayleigh McEnanynnnn      communications director Alyssa Farah and chief of staff Mark Meadows Here is the expedited transcript of that interview Portions of the interview were off the record and have been excluded from this transcript President Trump How are you Michael C Bender Im fine thanks How are you doing Mr Trump Im good Im good I think were doing good I just got some good poll numbers Mr Bender Oh did you Mr Trump I think were doing good So whats up Mr Bender Do you want to tell me about your poll numbers Mr Trump Were up in a lot of states Were looking very good in Ohio Very good in Wisconsin Very good in Florida Yeah I think were doing well I mean we havent started campaigning you know I have not essentially started I guess you could say it starts on Saturday right Whats the word on that Mr Bender You tell me Mr Trump I think its gonna be a hell of a night Ill tell you Mr Bender Are you looking forward to it  Mr Trump Yeah Are you going Mr Bender No Im not this time Mr Trump You should go Try and go Mr Bender Were in a rotation to travel on Air Force One So Ill be in there soon Mr Trump Oh I see Its rotation So youll be in the next one The next rally Mr Bender Maybe Ill have to look at the rotation But very soon Mr Trump OK Good Mr Bender So have you been pushing to do a rally Its been a while Mr Trump These are judges look Mr Trump holds up a stack of documents that once signed will formally nominate individual judges So well be up to oh I dont know 254 or something very soon This a United States district judge districtNew Mexico All judges Nobodys done anything like that one right Mr Bender Thats a lot of judges Mr Trump The judge situation yeah I think were doing Do you mind if I sign this while we talk Mr Bender No Sounds good Go ahead A little multitasking Well maybe we can just talk about the rally for just a second What do you think about some of the risks from coronavirus Mr Trump Well one of the reasons we chose the location Oklahoma is theyve done very well with respect to the rallywith respect to thethey have a really good arena but theyve done very well with respect to the I call it the plague The plague that was sent by China And I think that you know the numbers are very small They said theres a spike the spike is I wish Mike Pence were here because he was showing me the numbers before Its like very few people And I think theyre in great shape But I would even say the spike ends has already ended So I think were going to do very well you know I think were going to do well I think its time to start our country up again basically And could we keep it shut longer Personally I dont think so I dont think people would take it And I think it would be the wrong thing to do We have great retail numbers I mean its the early surge We have great retail numbers It was supposed to I guess 7 they were estimating 7 Were going to be 177 So I think that its going to be great I think were gonna have a really good third quarter This quarter as you know whats going on now were finishing out the results of what we had to do So the third quarters really our first quarter where we can show something and I think I mean based on the numbers the employment numbers you saw were good Beyond good Actually I think they were reported as the best numbers in history best employment quarter in history Best employment month in history Mr Bender How low can you get the employment rate by November Mr Trump Well I think we can get tremendous numbers of jobs by November I think by the end of the year were going to have a vast number of jobs largelyshortly thereafter we should be almost where we were And I think ultimately next year is going to be a fantastic year I think next year is going to be a really fantastic year You know I was predicting the V right You know that From the beginning And now everybodys saying Im right And well see Weve got tremendous momentum Now itll be interesting to see where that momentum goes now We were riding really straight through Doing great And then we got hit by the China virus And frankly were starting a little bit of a different campaign Now its about jobs Before it was about other things but basically before it was about keeping it where it was Now its about having it go up And it will go up I think youll see big GDP increases I think youll see big jobs increases And I think youre going to see big retail sales increases which youve already seen So if you look at the two the two stats that have come outTwo weeks ago you had the job numbers which were the biggest monthly gain in history And yesterday you had the retail sales numbers which was the biggest the biggest gain177in history And the estimate I guess was 6 6 to 7 And it was 177 So the numbers are looking much better than people thought Mr Bender Thats true Im sure youve seen the statistics though about how it relates to elections Mr Trump About how what does Mr Bender Jobs numbers and unemployment Mr Trump How it would relate to my chances for reelection Yeah you know the sad thing is that I was sailing You understand That was a free shot Now I mean if you look at it people say He got us there once hes going to get us there again That was the greatest economy the greatest job numbers weve ever had We were up to almost 160 million jobs Nobody was ever close But now I just have to start building it up again We started And I think that the numbers are beyond anybodys expectations Mr Bender Do you think you can get the unemployment rate below 8 by Election Day Mr Trump I dont know Well have a lot of jobs before November 3 I mean all I can say is this We will have created a lot of jobs prior to November 3 Tremendous number of jobs a tremendous increase I expect a tremendous increase in GDP And well be heading you know for the top Well be back And weve had a lot of advantages a lot of experience We did it once and well do it again Bottom line is we did it once and you would agree Best job numbers best economy best everything weve ever had China we were beating China badly China last year would have had the worst year theyve ever had in many many years and decades And that was because I put a lot of tariffs on China that they never wanted And I dont want them to have bad years but they happened to have a very bad year last year And thats before the virus Now of course they didnt even report their numbers this year You know they refused to report their numbers right But last year was a bad year for China one of one of the very bad years that theyve had And thats largely because I put tariffs on Nobody ever put tariffs on them Nobody ever did anything to China China walked away from ObamaBiden No tariffs no downside no nothing Whereas we took in billions of dollars of tariffs and they were all put on by me And they dont follow the phase one dealits a phase one dealif they dont follow it I would substantially raise the tariffs if that were necessary So far I think theyreI havent had the final report but it looks like they are Theyre buying a lot Mr Bender Speaking of China there is a lot about China innnnnnnnnnn      n      John Boltonsnnnn      new book And trade And he makes a lot of accusations about you prioritizing trade over the enforcement of sanctions when it comes to ZTE and Huawei Mr Trump Well look how tough Ive been on Huawei Nobody has been tougher than me on Huawei Look at whats going on with Huawei I mean weve convinced other nations not to do business with them Whether its UK or Italy or others We can give you all the list Nobody has ever been so tough on a company as I have to Huawei  So nobody has been tough on Huawei like me and theres nobody been tough on China like me Now I dont know what Bolton has said I havent seen it yet But Bolton is a disgruntled guy who made tremendous mistakes He was one of the architects of the Middle East policy And the only thing I liked about Bolton was that everybody thought he was crazy And frankly when you walk into the room with him youre in a good negotiating position Because they figure youre going to war if John Bolton was there He wanted to go to war with everybody He never saw a war he didnt like He made a tremendous mistake You know he and the people that he was pushing when he went into the Middle East when he went into Iraq That was a terrible mistake There were no weapons of mass destruction That was John Bolton He wanted the job so badly He couldnt get approved by the Senate It was a nonSenate confirmedhe couldnt get a Senate confirmed job And by the way he didnt the first time Did you know that He wasnt Senateconfirmed the first time No But I view him as a disgruntled employee Very unhappy Hated to leave He was basically a man who was not happy to be leaving Was not happy to be leaving He had a lot of policy disputes he and I And after the first month or so you know I asked him one question I said So do you think you did the right thing by going into Iraq He said Yes And thats when I lost him And that was early on Thats when I lost him But no I disagreed with much of the stuff he said He was one of many people I liked listening to many people and then doing whatever is the right thing to do Mr Bender You didnt ask him about Iraq before you brought him into the White House If he regretted that Mr Trump No but it didntI knew all about his policy on Iraq But that didnt matter frankly Because he made a terrible mistake And so did everybody else involved in Iraq and the Middle East frankly I never thought it was the right thing to do And Ive been proven right But when he told me he still thinks it was the right thing to do and was unable to explain it to me I said Explain that to me because I dont think you can And he could not explain it to me So I said Do you say that just to make yourself feel good Or do you say that because you really believe it He said I really believe it I said Well then youve lost me because its just wrong Mr Bender Youve talked about how your viewpoint on the trade deal has changed a little bit after coronavirus Mr Trump Yeah Mr Bender In the book Bolton says that you wanted to lift the penalties off ZTE as part of a trade negotiation Mr Trump Well he wasnt here there for that ZTE was my deal I put the fine on them And Ive never seen anything quite like it I essentially closed them up That was me Obama didnt do it That was me I closed them up And then we settled with them We let them make a deal fairly shortly thereafter They paid over a billion dollar fine and agreed to board changes and all sorts of other things So an unbelievable deal It was short Do you know what Im talking about I dont know exactly what the timing was And then immediately the Democrats say Oh you should have gotten more I said wait a minute this is my deal So I closed them up What was it Michael like 12 billion Mr Bender I dont remember exactly Mr Trump Well go back and find it Something like 12 billion So I close them up They paid a tremendous amount in fines I dont know what it was I think it was over a billion dollars And they opened up But we also got them to change their board as I remember it and the management and other things So ZTE was great Now as always the Democrats when you go in and you say Hey I got a billion dollars or whatever was Kayleigh McEnany White House press secretary It was 13 billion Mr Trump 13 billion For nothing Listen to this I closed them essentially I said were not going to do business They come and ask how do we get out of this I ask them for a lot of money They pay 13 billion and other things not just 13 And then the Democrats say Oh you could have gotten more They didnt do it Do you understand They didnt do it I did it So we pick up 13 billion in fines And its an amazing deal Now the Democrats will say Oh because  Iif by the way if I got 10 billion in fines if I got 200 billion if I ended up owning Beijing for 1 they would have said The deal is not good enough because thats what they always say Any deal you make theyll say its good enough Like with the policemen They say Oh you could have made a better deal you know And perhaps Id say the same thing with them Mr Bender I guess I wonder about your perspective on the trade deal now especially given the moves you made on ZTE and in the book Bolton says that you effectively gave your blessing to President Xi to continue building camps for the Uighur Muslims Mr Trump No thats not true Thats not true In fact I approved a deala reprimand etc etcfrom Congress Thats been done Its been all done Its been signed But I approved The deal came in from Congress recently And its been going along in Congress I could have killed that very easily All I would have to do is make a statement that Im against it Mr Bender That was today that you signed that Mr Trump No but this has been going in Congress for a long time And I could have fought it And I would have won But I didnt fight that deal Mr Bender Bolton and Pompeo and Pence all wanted you to sanction China for detention of these minorities but you were reluctant because of what it meant for the trade deal And I guess what Im wondering is now that you sort of have a different viewpoint on the trade deal do you regret Mr Trump No I think the trade deal is a great deal But ever since we got hit with the Chinese plague I feel different toward everything having to do with China And Ive always been hardline on China Bolton never told me to do tariffs on China Bolton never thought you could get any tariffs done on China Bolton has no economic sense Bolton never thought you could get tariffs on China They paid us billions of dollars I gave our farmers 12 billion and 16 billion dollars out of tariffs I took in from China which were much more than that You understand Because they were targeted The farmers were targeted Bolton never thought you could getmost people never thought you could get tariffs I even in the deal we left a lot of the tariffs in the dealbig portions of the tariffs I think 25 Nobody thought you could make a deal like that Because we got the deal and we got the tariffs But since we got hit with the virus I have a very different perspective on China Very different perspective And I view it very differently But nobody has been tough on China like I am And you know that Look under Obama and Biden they got away with murder This should have been What Ive been doing to China should have been done a long time ago ObamaBiden never They just came in and it was pillage It was terrible And they should have done something like what Ive done But weve taken in billions of dollars and by the way they devalued their currency in order to pay for the tariffs They devalued and they put up they paid money Otherwise their product wouldnt have sold because the tariffs would have made their product too expensive But the deal we made with China was a good deal but I feel differently The ink was barely dry when we got hit with the virus and I view that I view that whole deal differently now I view the relationship with China differently than Mr Bender I do want to ask a couple questions about China But just one more Boltons book and then Ill move on Pompeo has a very big role in this book Bolton writes that Pompeo told him multiple times he was close to resignation He says Pompeo passed him a note during your meeting withnnnnnnnnnn      Kim Jong Unn      nnnn      saying that you were full of shit Mr Trump Who is full of shit Mr Bender You sir Mr Trump I would doubt that Does he have the note Let me see the note Mark Meadows the White House staff chief enters the Oval Office Mr Meadows Mr Bender Mr Bender Mr Meadows Mr Trump No I would doubt that I have a very good relationship with Pompeo Mr Bender Thats what I was wondering There is so much in here on Pompeo I was wondering if this is a Tillerson moment for Pompeo when things became so strained between you and Tillerson Mr Trump I have no strain with Pompeo No I have a very good relationship with Pompeo Mr Meadows Extremely good Alyssa Farah White House communications director Hes going to push back on that Mr Trump No I would doubt that I have a very good relationship with Pompeo Hes right now having an important meeting with somebody at their request Do you know that Mr Bender No I didnt know that With who Mr Trump No Now I have a very good relationship with The one who has a bad relationship with Pompeo was Bolton Did you know that Pompeo and Bolton had a terrible relationship What you dont see that How does that come out in the book Mr Bender Bolton casts a critical eye toward just about everybody in your White House Mr Trump Everybody in the White House hated John Bolton that I could see There might have been some people To Mr Meadows Did you deal with him at all Yeah you did You think hes terrible Mr Meadows Yes I did John Bolton is very self important And you can quote me on that Mr Trump And not very smart Mr Meadows The best way this book could be described is In The Room Where It Didnt Happen Because nothing that he touched ever happened because he couldnt find consensus Mr Trump And with a short period of time as we all got to know him because I didnt know him very well I didnt know him at all before this I figured eh hes a hardliner I like having a hardliner Hes a hardliner but I call him a stupid liner because it was so foolish I could tell you things that he wanted to do that if we would have done them we would have ended up on our own Iraq a nice new version of Iraq Mr Bender Whats an example of that Mr Trump I dont want to say Ill have to say when I write my book but nobody cares about Bolton I would say this look he was somebody that wasnt liked at all and wasnt respected very much As we got to know him he was respected less and less Personally I thought he was crazy And other than the fact that he goes out and writes a book when he shouldnt be writing a book you know You dont leave and then write a book And hes got you know I think hes got a lot of legal problems for doing it I think hes got probably a lot of legal problems He should not have done what he did But you dont leave the office and go out and write a book about a current administration thats doing well but about a current administration Who would ever think of doing something like that Mr Bender So he does address that in the book And the reason he says he wants this book out now is to essentially warn conservatives He describes your reelection as the last guardrail on you in the White House and worries that Democrats may enjoy your second term more than conservatives Do you want to address that point and Mr Trump Well sure Look Im signing now in front of you judges All judges I wont give you the names All judges Texas New York Minnesota Im signing off judges Were going to have potentially close to 300 judges including DC Itll be close to 300 Nobodys close Theyre all conservaative highly respected judges Theyre going to be there for many years Theyre all young Theyre all conservative Theyre all very smart And theyre getting great reviews If I did nothing else thats good Plus I put two Supreme Court judges in that are excellent people But if I did nothing else and its really amazing because if I wasnt here those judges go to super liberal young smart judges okay Super liberal radical left And you wont have your Second Amendment any longer And you will have a view on life thats much different than the view on life now That will change And you wont be spending money on the military Ive totally rebuilt the military Its the strongest its ever been All made in the USAer 2 trillion right I created the Space Force I got Anwar done that even Reagan couldnt get done I got the biggest tax cuts in the history of our country I got the biggest regulation cuts in the history of our country Ive done things that no administration has ever done in the first three and a half years Mr Bender Its been a very active four years I can Mr Trump No give me a list Look at her Mr Trumps assistant enters the Oval Office with a list of Mr Trumps accomplishments Shes so unbelievable She is so quick I look up and shes walking in with a list Look at that Take this and read it OK because honestly this is page after page of things that Ive done Just take this and read it Its pretty amazing Added 25 million jobs This is recently 25 million jobs in May shattering the expectation that we will lose 10 million jobs Were going to lose 10 million unfortunately for the critics we Retail Sales up 177 which is the largest in history job gains last month was the largest increase ever Nearly 300 jobs were created for AfricanAmericans last month 75 of small businesses are now open Thats a big number It was estimated would be a much lower number SP 500 had the best 50 days in history The was a week before actually And this was a good week So I guess that continues Nasdaq hit 10000 for the first time an all time record Nasdaq that was three four days ago In the middle of the pandemic not in the middle toward the end of the pandemic In my opinion Hope Im right Saved the New York Times The Washington Post and cable television I put that in for fun but I did its true Because when Im here when Im not here Maybe not The Wall Street Journal but much of the media is going out of business Because if you have to cover sleepynnnnnnnnnn      Joe Bidenn      nnnn      whos dead from the neck up if you have to cover sleepy Joe Biden I dont think its gonna be too exciting Mr Bender Well what would you say is a new priority for the second term One new initiative Mr Trump Well it would have been much different if you asked me that question three months ago because the economy was really rocking And I would have been cutting debt I would have been cutting expenses I would have been cutting a lot of things It would have been you know different Now the new priorities Building the economy to a point where it was plus because were gonna have a better economy than it was Because of certain things Im doing So if you would have asked me the question three months ago I would have said reducing debt and building a you know just a continuation of what Im doing now Now youre asking me the question and now its building a really strong powerful economy And I think next year we can have a better we can have one of the best years weve ever had And dont forget so far Ive been right Now you know you may come to see me in a couple of months And Michaels always been fair I dont mind you know seeing you Youve always treated me well Sometimes hes treated me fairly But when I explained it to him hes treated me fairly When Im not here to explain it to him its a little different I told them I said theres going to be a V And everybody is now saying that I was right Mr Bender Youve kind of described it as a snapback that once the economy reopens all these jobs come back But is there something you plan on Mr Trump Thats because it was an artificial closing It wasnt like a bad horrible recession that takes years to develop and it just starts tumbling downhill and it takes 15 years to recover as it did with the Great Depression and some really big recessions and it would take 1015 years to recover Mr Bender A lot of economists say it will take a while to come back Several decades of job growth have been lost in the last couple months My question is whether you have a new initiative in mind to reenergize the economy to bring back jobs and get people back to work in a second term Mr Trump So aside from everything else when we got rid of Nafta which was a disaster We have a great USMCA now And in addition we are making much better trade deals that we had in the past If you look at Japan theyre buying 40 billion worth of stuff And building many car plants here Germany is doing the same thing Germany has to do what theyre doing you know building plants Theyre always difficult frankly And were reducing our troops in Germany because its costing us a lot of money and theyre delinquent on their payments You know theyre delinquent on their NATO payments They owe a lot of money Germany owes a lot of money They dont pay their bills Theyre supposed to be paying 2 and theyre paying 1 If that and its not fair So were supposed to defend Germany from Russia right And yet Germany pays Russia billions of dollars for energy How does that work Right So you know So weve made weve made great trade deals And I was about to make the best trade deal of all were all set to go and then we got hit by the pandemic If we didnt get hit by the pandemic we would have some additional trade deals that would have been unbelievable including with the European Union But instead of doing that everybody was being very conservative and heading for the shelters Mr Bender Youve talked about holding China accountable for coronavirus Do you think they sat on that information about the virus in order to tank other economies around the world Mr Trump They did something because if you look they had very little outbreak although now they seem to have an outbreak in Beijing which is interesting as of yesterday But everybody knew they had it I acted very early I closed our country to China By the way Bolton disagreed He thought we shouldnt do it okay He didnt think and you know I was in a room full of people You were there And of the people I dont know of anybody that thought I should do it That was a decision I made because I was seeing and hearing that China has a big problem So they have a big problem a big contagious problem a problem of contagion to put it a different way right And I closed our country in January the end of January I closed our country to Chinannnnnnnnnn      Nancy Pelosin      nnnn      was dancing in the streets of Chinatown at the end of February Mr Bender Did you consult with Bolton on coronavirus Mr Trump No I lost respect for Boltons intellect fairly early in the process It wasnt a big deal to me because frankly he was good for me to use in negotiations because everyone thought he was crazy and he would go to war Mr Bender Was that effective Was there an instance where you felt having Bolton in the room paid off in a negotiation Mr Trump When people saw Bolton in the room they figured probably he was stupid enough to go to war all the time You know he was a guy that I could tell you if I would have listened to him you and I would be in World War Three right now Hes crazy Hes crazy and I think hes not smart But you know what Im talking about right Mr Meadows Yes I do sir Mr Trump He wanted to do things that were insane Mr Bender Like what Mr Trump I dont want to tell you that Maybe Ill tell you you know at a later date But he had no touch He had no feel And I think he you know just had little intellect He was also somebody who just people didnt like him Nobody in the office liked him Nobody wanted to be with him Nobody wanted to talk much with him And I realized early on as I was saying before to Michael was when I asked him the question so John you were one of the people that were really pushing hard to go into the Middle East to go into Iraq Would you do it again He said Yes And thats where I said this guy is crazy Mr Bender That was only after a month Mr Trump Yeah I dont know But it was very early on I was talking to him I said So was that a mistake I said and its okay to admit you made a mistake although thats a big one Thats a beauty And I said Do you think it was a mistake And he said No I think it was the right thing to do And I said You know you cant explain that You just cant explain it So anyway Mr Bender Maybe points for honesty Mr Trump Thats very interesting Or maybe points for stupidity I can figure out which Oh wait you take this Mr Trump offers his print out of accomplishments You can add on to what I said Tried to deal with a Nafta By the way One thing It wasnt Bolton that killednnnnnnnnnn      n      al Baghdadinnnn      It wasnt Bolton that killed Soleimai  Bolton might say oh Trump wasnt tough enough on China and wasnt tough enough on this I know that kind of shit because he lied a lot He is a liar Nobody was tougher in China Nobody was tougher on Iran Nobodys been tougher on anything Well see how North Korea works out  Its early in that whole situation So well see You know in the meantime he expected to be in war OK Were not in war What have we given up Nothing Have we reduced sanctions No Have we done anything No And the fake news videototal phony media would say Oh Trumps give it up a lot Really what have I given up Nothing  Okay A few more Mike Mr Bender Just a couple on coronavirus and I want to make sure to as you a little about your police reforms Mr Trump On coronavirus I acted very quickly and I acted early And they cant get over it Number one Number two If I didnt act we would have had 3 million deaths And instead were at 110000 And we could be heading to a number thats you know higher than 150000 to 200000 it could be ending all now depending on how it goes Were doing very well on vaccine Were doing very well on therapeutic But if I didnt do what we did we would have anywhere from 15 million to 3 million deaths That would be 20 times more than well end up having you know 10 to 30 times more Mr Bender It sounds like youre very tuned in to whats happening in China and in the second waves that are happening there There was a spike a couple weeks ago in Wuhan Mr Trump Well first of all they dont We did an incredible thing not since the Second World War We had very few ventilators in our country You couldnt get them because every country was desperate for ventilators We went into the ventilatormaking business and now we have thousands of ventilators being made every week And were helping other countries with ventilators On the medical equipment same thing Were with making a lot I was up in Maine the other day I dont know if you were there The lines of people on the street in Maine That was a swab plant But were making a lot of our own stuff now And very importantly our testing is so far advanced of any other country And thats a good thing and a bad thing Heres whats bad about it We tested I think 20 some odd million people now right No country is even close to that You look at 4 million maybe 5 million in Germany no countrys even close to 20 million The problem is when you test youre finding cases youre finding kids that had it and you know etc etc Mr Bender Why is that a problem Mr Trump Well the problem is because were showing cases whereas other countries that dont have testing capacity they dont show cases So they say the United States has more cases than anybody else Thats because we do more testing If we use the same testing that I used in China or in Iran or in some of these larger countries it would blow us away First of all China doesnt report its testing So I do say they contained it Now just the last little day and its all of a sudden turning that maybe it wasnt contained But it seems to have been contained in China And why was it contained in China But the Chinese people that were infected go to Europe and go all over the world Mr Bender Whats the answer to that question Mr President Mr Trump Well thats what Im trying to find out Mr Bender What do you think it is Mr Trump There is a very good chance it was incompetence There was a very good chance it was a mistake And theres a chance that it was intentional Mr Bender You think that is a lesser chance Mr Trump Yeah I think so Because I dont think I dont think they would do that But you never know But it has had an impact Mr Bender And that would be to spread the economic consequences around the globe Mr Trump Correct Theyre saying man were in a mess The United States is killing us Dont forget my economy during the last year and a half was blowing them away And the reason is the tariffs Mr Bender Is that your gut on that Or do you have intelligence that they may have pushed this beyond their border Mr Trump Its my sense that could have happened I hope not And I hope well be able to find it out Mr Bender The Wuhan question I wanted to ask about the spike there which resulted in them testing almost all 11 million people in 9 days If there was a second spike in New York or Michigan would you push to test everyone in New York everyone in Michigan Mr Trump No I wouldnt I personally think testing is overrated even though I created the greatest testing machine in history Ive created the greatest testing machine in history And I think testing is overrated Mr Bender Why is that Mr Trump Because I think youll have it and youll test Im not saying testing is bad And certainly you test people and you want to see whether or not they have it But the testing can lead to a lot of mistakes also Look if we didnt test all the cases that were reporting you wouldnt know about any of those cases In many ways it makes us look bad The fact that were so good at something makes us look bad But having the ability to test ishas helped us a lot But dont forget we report every single deathWe report every case So if we test 20 times more than some other country were going to find cases They call them cases And thats only because our testing is much better Mr Bender You think testing is overrated because it adds to the caseload Mr Trump No not for that reason I just think that what you have to do is be careful regardless You have to be careful You have a certain population we now know that elderly people especially elderly people that have a problem such as heart disease or varioustheyre literally listed okay Theyre literally listed Diabetes heart disease I think would be number one and two But theyre listed If theyre elderly and they have those diseases its not easy Its not gonna be pleasant OK So we know where we should protect We had a number of governors that did a very very poor job with respect to nursing homes a very very poor job And they should have known better Mr Bender You also dont seem to like masks very much Do you think people are protesting you when they wear them Mr Trump Masks are a doubleedge sword People touch them And they grab them and I see it all the time They come in they take the mask Now theyre holding it now in their fingers And they drop it on the desk and then they touch their eye and they touch their nose No I think a mask is aits a doubleedged sword Its a doubleedged sword I see Biden Its like his whole face is covered Its like he put a knapsack over his face He probably likes it that way He feels good that way because he does He seems to feel good in a mask you know feels better than he does without the mask which is a strange situation Mr Bender Youve commented on Bidens mask a few times and a couple of reporters who wear masks Do you view that as a protest of you Do you feel like people wear masks to show their disapproval of you Mr Trump It could be yeah It could be But it could also be they feel better about it I mean Im okay with it Look Im okay with it But the mask is a doubleedged sword and I see it People come in theyre talking through the mask for hours They probably dont clean them after you know they get a little cocky right Then they take the mask they put their finger on the mask and they take them off and then they start touching their eyes and touching their nose and their mouth And then they dont know how they caught it Mr Bender One of my sisters is a nurse and shes described this as a false sense of security that it gives people Mr Trump Its possible It could be a false sense of security But think of it theyre touching it I watch them all day long Theyre playing with it You watch some of these politicians they start talking they take their fingers and they put them inside the mask and they rip it down Now their fingers are infected Potentially And then they touch their nose They touch their eyes they touch their mouth Voil Mr Bender So its okay if your supporters wear masks at the rally Mr Trump Absolutely They can wear them or not I want them to be happy Were gonna have a good time Yeah I want them to be happy Mr Bender What happens if your supporters get sick at one of these rallies Mr Trump Well people have to know that yes you do But its tiny You know its a very small percentage We did the right thing We closed it down We closed it down Expensive But you cant put a price on saving millions of lives We saved millions of lives You know a lot of people say herd Well how did herd work for Sweden No good How did herd work for Brazil No good Mr Bender Let me put it in personal terms Would you be okay if a family member of yours if Ivanka wanted to go sit in the crowd at your rally Mr Trump Yeah I would I would be Well first of all shes young And this really is a diseaseI was with the governor of New Jersey the other night because he wants to do a big bridge in New Jersey that theyve been trying to finance for 50 years And I approved it Very expensive bridge in New Jersey They need it Its been a real problem You know the bridge And he was telling me something that was shocking He said theyve had how many people died in New Jersey Ms Farah I dont know exactly But New York and New Jersey are onequarter of the cases Mr Trump Thousands of people They lost one person under 18 Hey would you find out the number of deaths in New Jersey The state of New Jersey It was only a few days ago So they lose one person under 18 he said I said thats amazing Thats why the schools have to open But the people that are at risk are our older professors and theyre gonna have to be careful Maybe not be there initially or maybe have you know be behind some kind of a protective shield But this was brought to us by China Just came in from China and should have never happened because they could have stopped it Mr Bender Can I ask just a couple questions on the George Floyd fallout Mr Trump Sure Mr Bender Do you think that theres systemic racism in the country Mr Trump In the country Mr Bender Yes In America Mr Trump Hopefully not But theres always something going on thats bad because theres always something going on Here let me just see that for a second Mr Trumps assistant hands the president a chart with the number of coronavirus deaths which total about 12800 OK Yeah So that number When he mentioned he said 12500 So he said at 12500 one person died under the age of 18 So I think that a lot of these are older persons So Im very happy Im young and in perfect condition OK Mr Bender You said you hope theres not systemic racism Do you think there is Mr Trump I would like to think there is not Yeah I would like to think there is not such systemic racism And it would be whatever I can do to make myself correct on that thought Id like to do it Now unfortunately in the real world there is some But I would like to whatever I could do to reduce that or get rid of it Id be very happy with Are you asking in police departments or the U S Mr Bender I meant systemic racism In police departments in hiring practices Mr Trump Yeah Id like to think there is not but unfortunately there probably is some I would also say its very substantially less than it used to be Mr Bender How are you thinking about some of these issues I know your position on law and orders is very clear Youve had some public events with the police You had some victims families in here yesterday But when it comes to Mr Trump By the way that was a very impactful moment The people I met were incredible people Mr Bender Impactful in what way What did you take away from that Mr Trump Meeting the parents in most cases parents of young people sons in many of the cases a daughter in one case that were killed is devastating To see the parents and so needless I mean it should never have happened I met with a large number of parents that were just I mean their lives have been torn apart Mr Bender Did any of those cases resonate with you Any particular story that stands out Mr Trump All of them Mr Bender Was there one that stood out Mr Trump All of them Ahmed Ahmad He is the young man who was running It was just sad to see The mother was a fantastic woman Made a great impression They all made a great impression on me In fact after that I had the speech with the law enforcement So we had two meetings And it was very interesting because they were very different meetings very important meetings But the impact of meeting the parents was very important Mr Bender The meeting with families was private And it sounds like everyone wanted to keep it that way for a number of reasons But when it comes to healing the country is that something you think about and have you thought about ways to try to bring people back together Mr Trump So I think Michael that the best way I can do it its leadership But I want to bring the economy back Because if I can bring the economy back AfricanAmerican unemployment was the best it has ever been by far Number of jobs overall Hispanic Asian But if I can bring the economy back were gonna have great jobs were gonna have families where life is going to be a lot easier Their life is just going to be better And I was there We had the greatest economy We had the largest increases and you know 32 increases Its unheard of what we did and I think you would have seen a lot of people starting to come together And now Im starting that process all over again because Wuhan I can give you 12 I can give you 15 different names for that We can call it China We can call it Wuhan We can call it many different things But because of the virus it came from China I have to start that process all over again Mr Bender Is there any part of you that wishing you hadnt sent the tweet about the shooting starts when the looting starts Mr Trump Well that tweet is viewed both ways And by the way that wasnt from some mayor in Miami there was a man named Frank Rizzo from New Jersey was a rough guy He ran a rough operation but he didnt have a lot of looting I can tell you But that is viewed both two ways Number one it can be viewed as a threat And number two it can be viewed as a fact that if people start looting then end up getting shot And thats usually a fact Now its less of a fact in a politically correct society Because I saw a lot of looting and these kids would just walk out with television Nobody was doing anything Mr Bender Did you view it as a fact or a threat Mr Trump I viewed it that generally speaking it could be a combination of both And look I think that its not right that police offices run by weak liberal Democrats allow kids to break into stores and walk out with television sets and put them in the back of a car Which is incredible Where does the car come from But you know I saw tremendous looting And I think its terrible There was tremendous damage done Small businesses were ruined Lives were ruined by that and people were killed Nobody mentions that They dont say Well what about the people that got killed on the other side Theyre more saying Oh what a horrible threat But no I view it to me it would normally mean that when somebody walks into a store and walks out carrying a television set on his back hes putting himself in great danger in theory But then you look at a place like Seattle where they take over a major part of a major city And the mayor says well its going to be a love fest and the governor does nothing and doesnt even says he doesnt know about it but on that hes lying obviously because he knew about it But he actually said you saw that he said Gee I didnt know nothing about that Thats a terrible thing Thats a terrible precedent Mr Bender You did move your rally off Juneteenth Can you talk about why you did that Mr Trump Well I did that out of respect because I had two AfricanAmerican friends and supporters And most people and I went to a lot of people they didnt they had not heard the term Juneteenth Mr Bender Do you know what it was Mr Trump I did something good I made it famous I made Juneteenth very famous Its actually an important event its an important time But nobody had heard of it Very few people have heard of it Actually a young AfricanAmerican Secret Service agent knew what it was I had political people who had no idea Did you ever hear of Juneteenth before Ms Farah I did from last year when the White House put out a statement Mr Trump Oh really We put out a statement The Trump White House put out a statement Ms Farah Yes Mr Trump Oh OK Good I dont think it was put up by others But we made people aware of it and its good But they asked me you know and these are two really good supporters AfricanAmerican supporters that they believe in what were sayingYou know we have a lot of black support tremendous black support Mr Bender Some people wondered why some of the black supporters didnt walk over to St Johns with you or why they havent been to many events Mr Trump Because they werent here I just made that decision very quickly Im the only man that can walk three blocksin dangercan walk three blocks hold up a Bible in front of a church that protesters just burned the hell out of and get bad publicity Im the only person thats capable of doing that Think of what I did I made a speech which people thought was a good speech I then walked across the street Not across the street I walked a long distance away Its like a three block walk And there is danger because of buildings Im not saying there is danger with the protesters because the Secret Service had that in very good shape We had no problem But this danger from above right I walked three blocks go to a church that had just suffered a major fire that was built at the same time as the White House So very important John Adams was the first parishioner Was he the fifth or sixth Whatever Youll figure it out First supporter First parishioner I hold up a Bible in front of the church that just got burned badly the night before and I got bad publicity than me Mr Bender There may be people who are critical of you no matter what But why didnt you pray Why didnt you read something from scripture Why didnt you bring someone from the black community Or a parishioner Mr Trump Well I was standing outside on a sidewalk It was very very noisy as you can imagine The protesters who the day before tried to burn down the churchYou know everyone was saying Oh they were so wonderful They werent wonderful They tried to burn down the church And it was they told me the same group A similar group So you have people screaming all over the place And I didnt think it was exactly the right time to pray Im on the sidewalk And the church itself I didnt want to go in because they had a lot of insurance reasons You know the church was boarded up The entire church was boarded up and I knew that So I went there stood there held up the Bible talked to a few people and then we left I came back and I got bad publicity But I also if you think about it I went to West Point over the weekend made a very good speech according to everybody They said the speech was one of the best The kids thought it was one of the best theyd ever heard Stood up there for a long time saluting Were you there Mr Bender No but I watched It looked like a really nice day Mr Trump Yeah After the helicopters came over the hats went up the general said Sir Are you ready I said Im ready And he led me to a ramp that was long and steep and slippery And I said I got a problem because I wear you know the leather bottom shoes I can show them to you if you like Same pair And you know what I mea theyre slippery I like them better than the rubber because they dont catch So theyre better for this But theyre not good for ramps I said General I got a problem here That ramp is slippery So Im going to go real easy So I did And then the last 10 feet I ran down They always stop it just before I ran they always stop it So I spent three hours between speeches and saluting people and they end up all they talked about is ramp  If you would have seen this ramp it was like an ice skating rink So Im the only one that can happen But the church is an interesting thing I mean here I spent three hours on stage the sun pouring in and I saluted 1106 cadets and thats not easy Even the general said Thats amazing Other presidents would never have been able to do it Because usually they do the first 10 They do 10 honor rolls and then they go home I stayed there for hours And what do I do I get publicity about walking down a ramp And does he have Parkinsons I dont think so Mr Bender Well some of it may be your campaign raising similar questions about Bidens age and people asking similar questions Mr Trump Well Im four years younger But no its not Bidens age I know people that are much older than me And theyre sharp as they were when they were 25 I know a man whos 92 is 100 sharp Take a look atnnnnnnnnnn      n      Bernie Marcusnnnnnnnn            Home Depotnnn      Take a look atnnnnnnnnnn      n      Sheldon Adelsonnnnn      So sharp Its not the age  But what the news does is they try and put me in that position they saw the ramp The amazing thing is the Washington Post did a story Do you have a copy of this story Its around someplace Could you give me the copy of the Washington Post this guy wrote on the ramp Do me a favor He said Trumps right I could not believe it Do you see the story that did a Trumps right It wasnt his health it was politics I said to the general This isnt good Dont forget the generals were in rubber you know rubber boots That was quick Rampgate has nothing to do with Trumps health This was in the Washington Post This was one of the great shockers of all time Do you want it You dont need it right Mr Bender I can get it at home Mr Trump The writer named Henry Olsen I said I cant believe the Washington Post I gained respect for The Washington Post They said they had a picture Look This is steel Steel Mr Bender Are you okay renaming some of the military bases with Confederate names Mr Trump So I would like to keep I dont think we should be changing these bases From these bases we won two World Wars and plenty of other things We had great victories Theyre known all over the world Fort Bragg is the largest military base in the world I dont think we should be changing the names and a lot of people agree They were named after the Civil War in some cases in order to bring people together north and south And now youre going to take them off Youre going to bring people apart Mr Bender Have you asked the two black friends you mentioned earlier about that Or your Secret Service agents Mr Trump No I havent asked them about that They told me about the Juneteenth This is youre asking me a separate question Mr Bender Yes I was wondering if you have members of the black community to run some of these questions by Mr Trump I havent discussed this with them I just say this Weve won two World Wars Those names were put on there for a reason It was a reconciliation It was bringing people together This was after the war And I think that were always trying to be so politically correct And its hurting our country very badly in my opinion Mr Bender The Buffalo protester the 75yearold man who fell He had a brain injury and cant walk So you still think he may be Antifa Mr Trump That I dont know I retweetedhe was a professional agitator He was having a fight with other guys there that were agitators that were younger Did you see the clip Do you see the clip of the young guys that were screaming Get the hell out of here They were fighting with them Then he steps and he puts himself right in the way of these people And then he takes something and starts putting it on their body touching them or close And somebody said it was a scanner whatever it was Im not saying anything one way or the other Im just saying What did he stand right in their path And he moved right into their path And the soldiers knew him Mr Bender Do you think hes still you still think he might be Antifa Mr Trump If you look at his tweets he certainly had things about Antifa on his tweets You saw that right And he deleted his entire account when the people started going because they saw the tweets and then he deleted his entire account So whats that all about No I dont like to see people hurt But he put himself right into the midst of the soldiers These police they meant business They were walking and he puts himself right there And you could tell they knew him They knew him But hes had a long history Too bad he had to get hurt Mr Bender You opened this on polls lets end it there Sounds like theres a big gap in Arizona Iowa is tightening How are you feeling about things right now Mr Trump I hear were doing very well in the polls And I see were doing very well We have polls And if you look at a lot of the polls theyre very heavily weighted Democrat But I hear were doing very well Well see Well get to know soon enough This is no different than what I had in a certain other election in 2016 And they would tell me about the poll Mr Bender You see parallels with the two races Mr Trump I think this is far worse I think the press is more dishonest now than it was in 2016 They call them suppression polls I think that Im way ahead in Iowa How could I not be ahead I took care of the farmers better than anybody whos ever taken care of farmers Biden would never do it He wouldnt even know that they had a problem How could they possibly go for Biden He wouldnt know the farmers even at a problem They were targeted for 12 billion and 16 billion and I got them 12 billion and 16 billion out of the tariffs that China was paying us and had a lot of money left over for the United States Treasury Mr Bender I know youre not happy about the press coverage Sometimes it seems you want to run against the press more than you do against Biden Mr Trump I just think that I dont think the press is extremely dishonest The only thing I cant figure out is why Go back a couple of months and take a look at what weve done And then we would have started with the debt and we would have started with cutting and you know bringing things really I mean we were in such great shape And you think people would love having a strong military and low taxes and all of these things that we had It was you know we have the strongest military now weve ever had One of the things I did also I dont even know if its in here the wall Our border security now is as good as its ever been But we just completed 212 miles of wall And thats one of the reasonsthats a lot you know in the most critical areas And nobody gets through that wall That wall is the real deal And so thats a big thing But well see you again Michael Mr Bender Who do you think Biden should pick as his VP Ill leave you on that Mr Trump I mean he said hes going to pick a woman So I would imagine hes going to pick a woman I would hope so I dont want to really guesstimate but you know there are probably three or four that I would see as being viable More than that Mr Bender Thank you very much for the time Mr Trump Any time Copyright 2020 Dow Jones  Company Inc All Rights Reserved

coronavirus lockdowns in more spacious quarters While many have begun to return as restrictions have eased others like Ms Gambey and her husband Charles are considering a permanent move Fears of a second wave of infections and the ease of remote working are prompting families with children pensioners and some young people to question the longterm benefits of city life In the US 39 of urban dwellers said the Covid19 crisis prompted them to consider leaving for less densely populated areas according to a Harris poll of 2050 adults conducted in late April In France 38 of potential home buyers widened their searches further from big cities as they sought gardens and an extra room for remote working during the pandemic according to a survey midMay by French realestate portal SeLoger In Germany where economic activity is more spread out across the country demand for houses in rural areas has risen steadily since lockdowns began in midMarch according to online realestate portal ImmoScout24 Evidently the corona pandemic sparked a renewed desire for the countryside said Thomas Schroeter managing director of ImmoScout24 Researchers though are skeptical of a broader exodus from cities even if the workingfromhome trend extends beyond the crisis Realtors say that while demand for rural and suburban properties is growing there is no evidence that it is turning into a mass movement Examples from past crisesfrom the Spanish flu of 1918 to wars in Europe and 9/11 in New York Cityshow that urban exiles tend to return researchers say While suburban areas may grow as a result of the pandemic people are unlikely to venture much further for long said Werner Btzing an emeritus professor of cultural geography at the University of ErlangenNuremberg in Germany Have you or someone you know moved from a big city because of the pandemic Do you expect to return Join the conversation below Those are shortlived ideas in which the countryside appears a safe place and the city

time is different Not only did the startup founder recently scrap the companys plan to move its headquarters from a Philadelphia suburb into the city center next year the 27yearold is also looking to

also suffered a drop in income due to the crisis which made them take a hard look at the cost of living in the city They are considering moving to her hometown in Texas at least until the pandemic is

plan to move from New York City while the virus was spiking there to the suburbs and made five offers for houses in Bergen County NJ Ms Bickoff has been staying with her parents in Connecticut since the lockdown began She plans to return only to pack up her things Not everyone is looking to move permanently The pandemic has also sparked a renewed interest in secondary residences In highest demand are rural areas within a short drive of large citiessuch as the Atlantic coast in France the sparsely populated state of Brandenburg that surrounds Berlin or Connecticut realtors say Alexandre and Caron GrandDewyse left their French countryside idyll with a heavy heart on June 14 after his work started to require him to go into the office for four days every other week The couple who are expecting their first child have spent the past three months in their familys 17thcentury stone cottage in a hamlet of 10 houses a twohour drive northeast of Paris They had to set up an internet connection buy a washing machine and endure cold winter days without central heating but Mr GrandDewyse said he loved birdwatching during his lunch break and gardening at the end of a days work for a large consumergoods company Beginning next year he will be allowed to work two days a week from home so the couple plan to divide their weeks between Paris and the countryside before figuring out a longerterm move The Gambeys meanwhile want to rent a new home for a year to get a feel for longterm country living see how remote working evolves and determine if they can find the right school for

blaming the countrys decision to reopen schools in May for helping fuel a large new wave of coronavirus infections that has prompted authorities to shut down sections of the economy once again In recent weeks the number of new cases of Covid19 the disease caused by the new coronavirus has risen to around 1500 per day nationwide from a low of fewer than 50 a day about two months ago The surge followed outbreaks in schools that by Monday had infected at least 1335 students and 691 staff since the schools reopened in early May according to the education ministry Epidemiological surveys by Israels health ministry showed that after Israel opened its entire school system without restrictions on May 17 a spike in infections occurred among the countrys youth that later spread to the general population Government figures also showed that in the month of June schools were the secondhighest known place of infection outside peoples own communities Now event halls and bars across the country have also been ordered closed again and the government has warned additional restrictions could be necessary In early May when infections ebbed the government of Prime Ministernnnnnnnnnn      n      Benjamin Netanyahunnnn      reopened much of the Israeli economy and society including the schools in a push to revive business activity and get Israelis back to work After a phased return to the classroom the government imposed few restrictions on schools Israels top public health officialnnnnnnnnnn      n      Siegal Sadetzkinnnn      resigned last week in protest of the governments handling of the coronavirus pandemic including the school reopenings Much of the source of the second wave stems from the opening of the education system in a way that was not adapted to corona and massgatherings she said in a Facebook post explaining her resignation While some argue the schools were a major contributor to the overall surge others say it is difficult to separate them from the broader reopening Israeli authorities allowed for the quick resumption of large gatherings like weddings and prayer services There was little enforcement of rules requiring masks in public Due to the fact that the restrictions were released very fast its difficult to disentangle the effects of each separately saidnnnnnnnnnn      n      Eli Waxmannnnn      a physicist who heads the panel of experts advising the government on the coronavirus There was a lot of pressure a lot of political pressure and this led to this toofast pace There was also an unjustified feelingthat we warned againstthat this is over Mr Netanyahu said last week that Israel opened the economy too quickly in order to put as many people back to work as possible but conceded that the full restart came too soon I take upon myself the responsibility for this step and I also take upon myself the responsibility to fix it he said Countries around the world are weighing the risks of sending children back to class against the consequences of leaving schools closed In the USnnnnnnnnnn      n      President Trumpnnnn      has demanded school districts open to inperson learning or risk losing federal funding Administration officials have emphasized schools importance to the economy saying that keeping them closed presents a challenge to working parents But some educators had voiced concern citing the nationwide surge in new cases and discussed other options such as a mix of online and remote learning or delaying the start of the school year Los Angeles authorities said Monday that they will start the school year with online learning European countries that reopened schools this spring largely avoided outbreaks with no major flare ups after students returned to classrooms in 22 countries Get a coronavirus briefing six days a week and a weekly Health newsletter once the crisis abates Sign up here Their school systems followed a variety of socialdistancing approaches The Netherlands halved class sizes and enforced social distancing but not for students under 12 In Denmark students were kept within small groups Israel by contrast had stopped imposing any socialdistancing restrictions by midMay After initially phasing in the reopening of the schools classes quickly returned to full size with as many as 40 students We Israelis really love social closeness hugging kissing giving high fives and

trusted the Israeli government to make the right decisions and the return to class freed up his wife to resume work as an English teacher Then the family learned the teacher of their 10year old daughter tested positive for the coronavirus Six other students in her class also contracted Covid19 His wife and daughter soon tested positive It does seem to be closing in on us from everywhere said Mr Zomer whose three other daughtersages 8 14 and 16have so far tested negative Danniel Leibovitchnnnn      principal of a Jerusalem high school that had the most significant outbreak with more than 150 cases among students and staff said he knew his school had a large outbreak once two people with no interaction both tested positive Its pretty clear that in coronavirus conditions you cannot continue to teach in full classrooms without a massive outbreak Mr Leibovitch warned In early June Israel enacted a policy of closing for two weeks any school that had at least one known infected student or staff member and quarantining all those who work at or attend the school This policy has led to the quarantine of more than 28000 students and educators Israel has closed 125 schools and 258 kindergartens since May Now Israels education ministry has developed different models for the reopening of the schools in the fall to be used depending on the level of infections Each plan will be applied according to the local infection level rather than nationally according tonnnnnnnnnn      n      Inna Zaltsmannnnn      a senior education ministry official If infections are considered under control students in kindergarten through fourth grade will return to school as normal while middle and highschool students will have a mix of inperson and distance learning as well as plastic barriers in classrooms to separate students as much as possible If infections rise further younger children will attend school in capsules while those in grades five through 12 will study from home In case of a large surge only younger students will continue to go to school but with ample socialdistancing protocols Teams are working on creating a guidebook to help schools switch between inschool and distance learning or how to social distance with school celebrations and graduation ceremonies During the first few months we needed to keep reinventing ourselves because it was new to everyone said Ms Zaltsman The Zomers meanwhile have grown tired of being stuck at home Mrs Zomer and her 10yearold daughter have relocated to the basement after testing positive Even after the familys exposure they arent second guessing government decisions and intend to follow whatever policies are in place for the fall If school is open Mr Zomer says theyll go Write to Felicia Schwartz at FeliciaSchwartzwsjcom

products that are the backbone of foodrelief efforts Donations of items like rice and soup dried up forcing many food banks to buy the goods instead and compete with retailers and other food banks The

known as disease enhancement because it worsens the disease the vaccine is supposed to protect against is a concern for vaccine research generally I think its important that we do rapid vaccine development but I also think its important we do it safely saidnnnnnnnnnn      n      Dr Barney Grahamnnnn      deputy director of the vaccine research center at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease He said he hasnt seen any areas of concern in testing to date for the coronavirus vaccines Moderna Incnnnnnnn            Pfizer Incnnn      and other companies say their coronavirus vaccines have shown to be generally safe and welltolerated in earlystage testing in small numbers of people Vaccines are designed to produce immunesystem agents including antibodies that lock onto a virus and thereby neutralize it In cases of disease enhancement however immune agents act in ways that facilitate replication of the virus The complication can dangerously increase the severity of the disease in people exposed to the pathogen after they get the shots Aside from affectingnnnnnnnnnnn            Sanofi SAsnnn      dengue vaccine Dengvaxia signs of disease enhancement stymied development of an experimental vaccine against respiratory syncytial virus or RSV after studies in children in the mid1960s detected the side effect The safety issue has hovered over efforts to bring to market a vaccine for the new coronavirus because signs of disease enhancement arose in research into vaccines for other coronaviruses Researchers studying experimental vaccines against the coronavirus that caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome or SARS in 2002 found that vaccinated mice developed enhanced disease when exposed to the virus No SARS vaccines have been approved for humans To avoid the complication coronavirus vaccine researchers have taken steps such as making available highquality antigens something the vaccine either delivers to or produces in the body to trigger a desired immune response Some researchers have designed antigens based on the spike protein found on the surface of the coronavirus Dr Graham said The virus uses the spike protein to latch onto human cells and gain entry Some vaccines under development contain something resembling the spike protein itself while others carry genetic code instructing the bodys own cells to make that protein By focusing on the spike protein a vaccine could primarily generate enough neutralizing antibodies to block the virus Dr Graham said and potentially avoid spawning too many other immunesystem agents that may attach to other parts of the virus and are suspected in disease enhancement He said this will have to be proven in studies While researchers have targeted the spike protein in experimental vaccines for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome and SARS none have advanced to be approved for broad use Johnson  Johnsonnnn      which is developing a vaccine targeting the spike protein and expected to start human testing this month says its technology is designed to elicit high levels of neutralizing antibodies and a type of response from other immunesystem agents known as Tcells The design could reduce the risk of vaccineassociated disease enhancement saidnnnnnnnnnn      n      Hanneke Schuitemakernnnn      head of viral vaccine discovery at JJ Because vaccines are given to healthy people to prevent diseaserather than a treatment given to a sick personthe threshold for safety is typically higher than for drugs About 20 coronavirus vaccines are in human testing and 140 more are in development according to the World Health Organization The final stage or phase 3 trials starting this month will prove crucial to establishingthat coronavirus vaccines dont raise the risk of disease enhancement researchers say because the studies will test in tens of thousands of subjects the same doses the public is expected to receive if the shots are authorized for use You wont know that is happening until you have somebody who got vaccinated and then was exposed National Institutes of Health Directornnnnnnnnnn      n      Francis Collinsnnnn      said in an interview referring to the risk for disease enhancement In small earlystage studies some coronavirus vaccine subjects experienced transient fevers or sore arms after vaccinations companies said The side effects unrelated to disease enhancement appeared more pronounced in people who received the highest doses tested the companies said Similar side effects have been seen in older vaccines commonly used for other diseases Carol Kellynnnn      received the second of two doses of Modernas experimental vaccine in May in a clinical trial at Emory University in Atlanta The next morning the 61yearold dietitian said she woke up with a feeling of vertigo and about a half a thimble full of energy The rest of the day she said she felt fatigued and had a headache She took pain relievers and the symptoms were gone by the next day and she has felt fine ever since she said Moderna Chief Medical Officernnnnnnnnnn      n      Tal Zaks nnnn      said the company expected some people to have adverse reactions and one of the main purposes of early testing is to find which dose levels are safest Certain reactions such as fatigue can be a signal that the vaccine has set in motion the desired immune response he said Youre paying a price in some symptoms to educate the immune system to prepare a defense against the coronavirus Dr Zaks said in an interview Jared Hopkins contributed to this article Write to Peter

of whether to send her daughters back to public school come fall or to do something new homeschool them I predict that the road ahead is going to be pretty bumpy says Ms Solot a 47yearold Albany NY business owner and resident who has daughters entering third and seventh grade School officials nationwide are scrambling to figure out how to reopen schools as Covid19 infection rates rise across the country Two of the nations largest school districtsNew York City and Fairfax Vahave said they will offer a mix of inperson and virtual learning in the fall while the Los Angeles school district announced Monday it will have no inperson learning when school resumes next month Many parents and teachers are concerned about the risks and restrictions associated with a return to inschool learning Health experts advise parents to look for certain safety measures based on the most current understanding of how the virus spreadsprimarily persontoperson with higher risks in crowds and indoors Among the most important Children should wear masks be grouped into small pods that dont mix with others and maintain physical distance Schools should also beef up hygiene practices and cleaning Other recommendations include outdoor instruction when possible lunch in the classroom and improving air ventilation and filtration in schools Choir singing and wind instruments are more risky they say Recess and outdoor gym less so Its absolutely critical that we get kids back to school saysnnnnnnnnnn      n      Joseph Allennnnn      director of the Healthy Buildings Program at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health who adds that there are costs to childrens physical and social wellbeing with ongoing remote learning from home Dr Allen and his colleagues recently issued a 60page report on riskreduction strategies for schools Particularly important he says is minimizing the potential for airborne transmission of the virus by improved air filtration and ventilation in schools This can be done by increasing the amount of outdoor air coming into classrooms through something as simple as opening the windows and using fans Schools with mechanical ventilation systems should use higher efficiency filters and ensure the system is using the maximum amount of outdoor air rather than just recirculating indoor air Portable air purifiers in classrooms also help The American Academy of Pediatrics issued recommendations last month for school reopening Their guidelines say physical distancing between students can be 3 feetrather than the standard 6feet recommendationparticularly when face coverings are worn Nathaniel Beersnnnn      a pediatrician at Childrens National Hospital in Washington DC and a member of the committee that developed the guidelines says the new distance recommendation was based largely on a June 1 Lancet study that suggests 3 feet between people is adequate If youre saying 6 feet theres no way most school districts can meet that criteria and have more than 50 of their kids in a classroom says Dr Beers The group recommends middle and highschool students wear face coverings as much as possible Dr Beers said with younger children who touch their faces and likely masks more frequently the value of wearing one may be diminished But other experts say universal maskwearing is key to any school reopenings Dr Allen says building in mask breaks may be helpful Mask fatigue is real he says Good times for mask breaks could be during quiet time or reading time when people arent talkingwhich can emit virus aerosols into the air Face shields are also a good alternative for children who wont wear masks experts say Creating pods or distinct classes of children that stick together and dont mix with the rest of the school population is another effective strategy experts say particularly in elementary schools When a student tests positive for Covid19 for example only those in their classroom would need to get tested or quarantine It makes control a lot easier saysnnnnnnnnnn      n      Ashleigh Tuitennnn      an assistant professor of epidemiology at Dalla Lana School of Public Health at the University of Toronto If you do have a case in a pod you can isolate students You know who has been exposed Protecting teachers and staff is also critical Staff should socially distance from one another saysnnnnnnnnnn      n      Alyssa Bilinskinnnn      a doctoral student in health policy at Harvards graduate school of arts and sciences who is working on a study modeling Covid19 outbreaks in schools Meetings should be held remotely and lunch eaten separately to lower risk of any virus spread Experts say teachers should return to teaching in front of the classroom to create a buffer between them and studentsas large as 15 to 20 feet They should always wear masks or face shields when they need students to see their facial expressions Most experts acknowledge the infrastructure isnt there for regular widespread testing of students That likely wont happen until there are affordable rapid saliva tests But once available regular testing of students and teachers is a good strategy experts say Countries in Asia and Europe have opened largely with avoiding large outbreaks but experts note in most other countries community transmission rates of Covid19 were low when schools reopened in contrast to many US states now The consensus is younger children are less likely to get Covid19 and while there is also some evidence that they may pose a lower risk of transmission to adults it isnt conclusive Some experts say however that plans for school reopening should account for growing evidence that older studentslargely teenagersappear to have a greater risk of both developing Covid19 and transmitting the virus What

Wall Street Journal","https://www.wsj.com","www.wsj.com","c https//wwwwsjcom/articles/thethreekeyhurdlesforacoronavirusvaccinetoclear11596200623 Vaccines have transformed the world saving hundreds of millions of lives They are also by far our best hope to stop the Covid19 pandemic Our other choices for stopping the disease are staying apart which hammers our economy and society or building herd immunity through natural infection which would mean more than a million deaths in the US and 10 million or more deaths worldwide But the push for a Covid19 vaccine faces three key hurdles First will it work Preliminary studies indicate that several types of vaccine now in development produce a strong immune response This is good news but it doesnt mean that the vaccine will protect people against infection or disease We dont know whether the immune response is protective and if it is how extensive that protection will be Protection ranges from 0 to 60 for influenza vaccines to 95 or higher for some other vaccines Even if a vaccine protects against disease it may not prevent people from becoming infected and spreading the virus to others Nor do we know whether all people will be protected by a new vaccineparticularly older people who are at a markedly higher risk from Covid19 and may be less likely to have a strong immune response We also dont know how long any protection will last We dont even know how protective natural Covid19 infection is for many vaccines the extent of immunity to natural infection is the ceiling of their potential efficacy n        We dont know whether all people will be protected by a new vaccinen         Still we have ample reason to be guardedly optimistic that some vaccines will provide some level of protection and that this will be demonstrated before the end of 2020 Some vaccine candidates may be duds and others efficacy may wane within just a few monthssomething that will of course take many months to know Different vaccines may be more or less effective and some vaccines may work less well for some groups And most vaccines never make it to approval many of todays promising candidates may fail We simply dont know Thats what studies are for Second will it be safe What could go wrong with new vaccines A lot Several candidate vaccines use a harmless virus as a vector to deliver the antigen This technology is promising but we have limited experience using it And weve never used DNA or RNA vaccinesthe technology used for several Covid19 vaccines in developmentin humans We now know that a small proportion of children who contract Covid19 get a potentially lifethreatening inflammatory condition as their immune system reacts to the coronavirus A vaccine could in rare instances create a similar immune storm that causes severe illness particularly in children either from the vaccine itself or from subsequent exposure to the virus There is no particular reason to believe that Covid19 vaccines will cause this type of overreaction but it is a risk and must be studied both before and after approval Polio vaccination provides a cautionary tale Soon after the vaccine was invented one manufacturer contaminated a batch of vaccine and many children became paralyzed In 1976 when an outbreak of H1N1 influenza at Fort Dix NJ sparked concern about a pandemic Presidentnnnnnnnnnn      n      Gerald Fordnnnn      led the effort to vaccinate tens of millions of Americans But the feared pandemic never materialized and the vaccine paralyzed more than 500 people some of whom had lifelong problems as a result Despite these rare and unfortunate episodes vaccines are still strikingly safe Billions of doses are given to people worldwide each year with very few problems Yet adverse events from vaccination may not be apparent until hundreds of thousands or millions of people have been vaccinated so there can be no shortcuts on safety Humility is in order Third can we get it to people Even if we can develop an effective vaccine with a reassuring initial safety record will we be able to get it to people Vaccine manufacturing isnt simple Failures or contamination can happen even with experienced pharmaceutical companiesand not all the companies making the new vaccines are experienced And even if an effective apparently safe vaccine is produced in large quantities it will be difficult to distribute it quickly and equitably to store and ship it at the right temperature to educate physicians and inform communities and to monitor uptake and possible harmful aftereffects The protection provided by even a highly effective vaccine is only as good as our delivery systems The measles vaccine is more than 90 effective but the World Health Organization reports that more than 140000 children died of the disease worldwide last yearmost of them in communities with low vaccination rates n        Particularly in this election season the process of vaccine evaluation must be scientifically rigorous and openn         The biggest challenge to getting a Covid19 vaccine into enough peoples arms wont be scientific technical or logistical it will come from a lack of trust Particularly in this election season the process of vaccine evaluation must be scientifically rigorous and open Public trust can be eroded by large profit margins for vaccine makers a lack of transparency about the cost of production and prices that fail to take into account the fact that many vaccines benefit substantially from publicly funded research Open meetings of the key advisory committees of the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will be indispensable We must level with the American public in a way that hasnt been done during this pandemic We dont have enough tests so we need to prioritize We dont have enough protective equipment for healthcare workers so we should produce safely reusableN95 masks And when vaccines do arrive we wont have enough for everyone Different vaccines may become available at different times and some will probably work better than others Governments will need to set priorities among different groups considering such factors as the risk of severe Covid19 disease protection of essential functions and fairness Workers in jails nursing homes and hospitals for instance and Black and Hispanic people are more likely to be exposed to the virus and to have underlying health conditions that make them particularly vulnerable Moreover vaccines wont provide perfect protection and probably wont completely end the pandemic In our interconnected world a truly global vaccination campaign will be essential to Americas longterm health and economic recovery  Even within the US unless the vaccine is extraordinarily effective and accepted cases and clusters will continue necessitating quick effective publichealth responses Our society will still have to adapt to limit the viruss spreadreducing close contact indoors holding off on handshakes wearing masks and improving ventilation And unless the vaccine is surprisingly potent or we discover very effective treatments my 91yearold mother wont be returning to her beloved choir practices soon Deploying a Covid19 vaccine is the most important thing we can do to restore some order and normalcy to our world We cant afford to get it wrong Dr Frieden was the director of the CDC from 2009 to 2017 He is the president and CEO of Resolve to Save Lives an initiative of the publichealth organization Vital Strategies and a senior fellow at the

US Federal Reserve to keep the wheels of finance turning for businesses across America And when funds stopped flowing to many banks and companies outside Americas bordersfrom Japanese lenders making bets on US corporate debt to Singapore traders needing US dollars to pay for importsthe US central bank stepped in again The Fed has long resisted becoming the worlds backup lender But it shed reservations after the pandemic went global During two critical midMarch weeks it bought a record 450 billion in Treasurys from investors desperate to raise dollars By April the Fed had lent another nearly half a trillion dollars to counterparts overseas representing most of the emergency lending it had extended to fight the coronavirus at the time The massive commitment was among the Feds most significantand least noticedexpansions of power yet It eased a global dollar shortage helped halt a deep market selloff and continues to support global markets today It established the Fed as global guarantor of dollar funding cementing the US currencys role as the global financial systems underpinning Just as the Fed expanded its role in the US economy to an unprecedented degree during the 2008 financial maelstrom it has in the coronavirus crisis expanded its power and influence globally The Fed has vigorously embraced its role as a global lender of last resort in this episode saidnnnnnnnnnn      n      Nathan Sheetsnnnn      a former Fed economist who was the Treasury Departments top international deputy from 2014 to 2017 and now is chief economist at investmentadvisory firm PGIM Fixed Income When the chips were down US authorities acted The value of the dollar has tumbled in recent weeks against other currencies as investors grow more troubled about the economic outlook and difficulty containing the coronavirus Still it is trading near levels recorded before the pandemic hit this year and above its longterm average on a tradeweighted basis saidnnnnnnnnnn      n      Mark Sobelnnnn      a former US Treasury Department official now at the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum a Londonbased think tank Concerns that shortterm declines in the dollar are an omen that its standing as the global reserve currency faces a threat are vastly overdone he said The Fed supplied most of the money abroad via US dollar liquidity swap lines In essence it lends dollars for fixed periods to foreign central banks and in return takes in their local currencies at market exchange rates At the loans end the Fed swaps back the currencies at the original exchange rate and collects interest By stabilizing foreign dollar markets the Feds actions likely avoided even greater disruptions to foreign economies and to global markets Those disruptions could spill back to the US economy pushing the value of the dollar higher against other currencies and damping US exportsand the economy The risks to the Fed are minimal given that it is dealing with the most creditworthy nations and the most advanced central banks But there are risks that investors come to expect a safety net for dollars that might lead to riskier borrowing during good times The Fed began deploying the swap facilities on March 15 By the end of March it had expanded them to include 14 central banks while launching a separate program for those without swap lines to borrow dollars against their holdings of Treasurys By Mays end the total lent out under the programs peaked at 449 billion The Feds goal is to keep financial markets functioning and the March events had the makings of a global panic with a resulting rush for cash The aim was to prevent investors from dumping Treasurys and other dollardenominated assets such as US stocks and corporate securities to raise cash which would have driven prices of those assets even lower Fed Chairman Jerome Powell in a May 13 webcast acknowledged the Feds global role more explicitly than his predecessors had during the last global financial crisis The loans let foreign central banks supply dollars cheaply to their banking systems and stopped everyone in that chain from panicselling assets like US Treasurys to raise cash he said It had a very constructive effect on calming down those markets and reducing the safety premium for owning US dollars Andrew Hausernnnn      the Bank of Englands top markets official in an early June speech said those swap lines may be the most important part of the international financial stability safety net that few have ever heard of On July 29 the Fed said it would extend the temporary programs originally scheduled to end in September through March 2021 The crisis and the economic fallout from the pandemic are far from over Mr Powell said and well leave them in place until were confident that theyre no longer needed The shift has brought little of the scrutiny the Fed saw during the 20082009 crisis When Mr Powell appeared before Congress for hearings in June lawmakers didnt ask a single question about the huge sums the central bank made available to borrowers abroad The Feds governing charter from Congress gives it the authority to operate the swap lines which it has done in some form since 1962 when the Fed heavily debated whether it had the authority to conduct foreignexchange operations Congress could revoke these authorities if it didnt approve of how the Fed was using them The swaps are structured so that the Feds foreign counterparts bear the risk of loans going bad or currency markets moving the wrong way A large portion of the Feds overseas loans have recently been swapped back as markets around the world have recovered The Feds aggressive overseas lending has injected it into the world of foreign policy Not every country gets equal access to the Feds dollars Turkey for example has appealed unsuccessfully for dollar loans from the Fed to support its sinking currency according to public comments made in April by the US ambassador to Turkeynnnnnnnnnn      n      David Satterfieldnnnn      A representative for the Turkish central bank didnt respond to a request for comment Those decisions are based on creditworthiness but political considerations could pose a threat to the Feds independence said Mr Sheets the former Fed economist When the Fed rolled out the lending program during the 2008 financial crisis centralbank officials consulted with the leadership of the Treasury and State Department to make sure any operations were consistent with broader US objectives he said The Fed was keenly aware of this tension that yes this was monetary policy but it was abutting some broader issues that were not typically the Feds area said Mr Sheets Concerns that such lending programs could suck the Fed into broader foreign policy entanglements were a meaningful constraint on the expansion of the swap lines he said The moves have also left the world ever more tied to a single countrys economic management and central bank Efforts have persisted for years to dilute the dollars central role via the euro then the Chinese yuan But knowing the Fed is willing to step in has led banks businesses and investors to flock to the US currency This gives the US enormous powerto punish foreign banks for violations of US sanctions for instance or to consider options like breaking the Hong Kong dollars peg to the dollar something US officials considered earlier in July The Wall Street Journal reported to punish China for its treatment of the city before shelving the idea It also has produced a familiar cycle saidnnnnnnnnnn      n      Stephen Jennnnn      chief executive of Eurizon SLJ Capital Ltd in London and a longtime currency analyst and money manager Investors value the dollar for its safety But every time there is a major market stress there is a run to the currency leading to breakdowns in the market which forces the Fed to step in which reinforces investors faith in the dollar he said People have become more dependent on the dollar than any other currency he added The Fed pioneered the current version of centralbank swap lines in 2007 when rising US subprimemortgage delinquencies jolted shortterm debt markets and made it hard for big European banks to borrow dollars Initially the Fed lent to some European banks US subsidiaries It later rolled out swap lines to two foreign central banks allowing the Fed to lend dollars with less risk and expanded them to a dozen others over 2008 and 2009 The Fed activated some of the swaps again in 2010 and 2011 as Eurozone debt problems mounted and set up standing facilities with five major central banks in 2013 One Fed bank president formally objected saying that the swaps effectively let European banks borrow at lower rates than US banks and that they were an inappropriate incursion into fiscal policy When coronavirus shutdowns hit the US and Europe in March oil prices plunged and stocks plummeted Companies drew down bank credit lines socking away dollars to pay workers and bills as revenue vanished Financial markets showed alarming signs of dollar demand Should the US Fed be the worlds lender of last resort during crises like the coronavirus pandemic Join the conversation below March 16 among the worst days in recent market history brought the financial system to the brink Stock prices plunged globally as investors scrambled to raise cash Banks sharply increased the cost of lending dollars to each other Foreign banks were forced to pay dearly gumming up the flow of dollars to their customers In South Korea big brokerages suddenly found themselves in need of large sums of dollars to meet margin calls according to Tae Jong Ok a Moodys Investors Service analyst who covers financial institutions in the country They had previously borrowed money to buy billions of dollars of derivatives tied to stocks in the US Europe and Hong Kong When those stocks plunged lenders demanded they put up more cash The scramble for dollars helped push the Korean won to its lowest level in a decade on March 19 Japanese banks suffered too Many had made loans directly to US borrowers The sector also owned more than 100 billion of collateralized loan obligationsbonds backed by bundles of loans to lowrated US companiesthat in some cases had been bought on shortterm credit and needed to be regularly refinanced Insurers in Japan that had invested heavily in higheryielding assets abroad also had difficulty securing dollars to fund their trades In Singapore high borrowing costs affected the dollar supply to companies needing to pay off debt or import and export goods according to bankers in the citystate There was a classic dash for cash scenario said a representative of the Monetary Authority of Singapore adding that dollarmarket conditions became so strained there was indiscriminate assetselling Central bankers from Singapore South Korea Australia and elsewhere swapped tales of the carnage on a regular call that included a representative of the Fed according to people familiar with the calls As the crisis snowballed the Fed increased purchases of Treasurys from 40 billion a day on March 16 to a record 75 billion days later It also expanded the dollar swap lines to nine other countries By March 31 the Fed had launched a new program that let some 170 central banks borrow dollars against their holdings of US Treasurys The rollout was faster and broader than when the Fed tentatively introduced the swap lines during the financial crisis a decade earlier Back then it was improvisation saidnnnnnnnnnn      n      Adam Toozennnn      a Columbia University history professor who writes about financial crises and war Today it seems extremely deliberate As financial markets recovered dollar borrowing costs for many banks and companies outside the US fell The Feds outstanding currency swaps started receding in midJune as a wave of transactions matured and werent renewed and fell further to 1072 billion as of July 30 The facility that lets central banks borrow against Treasury holdings hasnt seen much use Analysts said its presence alone helped stop the scramble for dollars While the Feds actions during the financial crisis sparked outrageseen to be aiding firms that caused the crisisthere have been no concerns raised publicly by US lawmakers or Fed officials about the Feds growing global role The whole pandemic is a different enemy saidnnnnnnnnnn      n      William Dudleynnnn      New York Fed president from 2009 to 2018 The political support for the Fed to be aggressive is much broader this time The Fed has had little choice but to intervene given the dollars global centrality Some 88 of the 66 trillion in currency trades that take place on average daily involve dollars according to the Bank for International Settlements or BIS The dollar is also the most commonly used currency in crossbordertrade in commodities and other goods In addition low American bond yields over the past decade prompted many big investors to send dollars to emerging markets By the end of 2019 the volume of US dollardenominated international debt securities and crossborder loans reached 226 trillion up from 165 trillion a decade earlier according to BIS data Discontent about the dollars growing dominance has percolated for years including among US alliesnnnnnnnnnn      n      Mark Carneynnnn      the Bank of Englands governor at the time took aim at the dollars destabilizing role last August in a keynote speech at an annual centralbankers gathering in Jackson Hole Wyo He argued the dollars

the attendee It took 21 days for testing to take offfrom Feb 8 when state and city publichealth labs detected a problem until Feb 29 when federal officials offered a broad solution The lost days stemmed in part from missteps by US health leaders They dismissed other solutions that could have led to national testing underestimated the risk of the virus spreading and were overly confident they could fix the problem according to interviews with people familiar with the testing crisis previously undisclosed emails and other correspondence reviewed by The Wall Street Journal There were already more than 50 mostly hidden infections a day in the US by midFebruary suggesting that community transmission probably began in January according to estimates from Northeastern University During the 21day delay the virus continued to move undetected on the way to making the US the world leader in coronavirus cases More than 54 million Americans have been infectedand more than 170500 have died as of Tuesday morning data compiled by Johns Hopkins University show The delay set back testing a critical tool to control the spread of a virus The lack of adequate testing meant publichealth officials

how to handle its testing snag South Korea had completed more than 58000 tests and the countrys response is widely considered a success though there has been a recent uptick in cases Officials at the HHS which includes the Food and Drug Administration and CDC disagree that testing delays worsened the pandemic While developing this first test is paramount to any pandemic response the CDC and our publichealth labs were not intended to bear the weight or capacity of nationwide testing on this scale said HHS spokesman nnnnnnnnnn      n      Michael Caputo This administration built a comprehensive diagnostic testing system from scratch he said and now has the worlds most robust publicprivate testing system and is better prepared to respond to future global health threats The HHS saidMr Azar wanted the testing delay to be fixed immediately The CDC didnt respond to requests for an interview with its director nnnnnnnnnn      n      Robert Redfield It wasnt until Feb 26 that the FDA conveyed a solution to publichealth labs They could run the tests without relying on the faulty component Three days later the FDA opened the doors for hundreds of hospital labs to begin tests without waiting for regulatory approval Mr Azar assumed the role overseeing the US response after the CDC alerted him to the coronavirus threat on Jan 3 Early on said people familiar with internal discussions he appeared confident he could handle the situation The HHS could have used a Germandesigned test promoted by the World Health Organization and reliably used by many countries Instead Mr Azar in January supported the creation of a CDC test he envisioned as the nations gold standard the people said The CDC normally develops the first test for new pathogens causing outbreaks and distributes it to publichealth labs Some FDA officials in January worried that relying exclusively on publichealth labs before engaging commercial and academic labs would take too long said FDA

Note Confirmed cases as of Aug 6 Sources Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering public records It wasnt until late February that the commercial labs started to make their own tests Some federal officials believed it was important for the CDC to develop its test first which was the standard process Mr Azar in a statement said he encouraged FDA to reach out to industry from the earliest days of the response Mr Azar who declined to comment further said in an April interview with the Journal that the CDC typically develops tests for novel pathogens because commercial testing can take months to develop An FDA spokeswoman said the agency reached out to labs early to build up a robust testing system Complicating matters for commercial and hospital labs a publichealth emergency Mr Azar declared Jan 31 created a new regulatory hurdle They would soon have to seek emergencyuse authorization from the FDA a potentially timeconsuming process before their tests could be used In a nonemergency hospital and academic labs are typically allowed to design and implement their own inhouse tests without much regulatory oversight The FDA spokeswoman said that in many cases the FDA can do this review in as little as a day All this meant everything was riding on the CDC going into February The agency created its test in just over a week The CDC test which the FDA authorized Feb 4 shipped by Feb 6 to 33 states and 70 labs in 66 countries according to an HHS report The test consisted of three components each of which detected a different string of the viruss genetic code The first two parts identified sequences unique to the new coronavirus The third component looked for a chunk of genetic material present in a wider swath of coronaviruses a catchall in case the virus mutated THE CDC VIRUS TEST STEP BY STEP VIRUS RNA The CDC coronavirus test uses a technique called rtPCR which searches a patient sample for pieces of the SarsCov2 genetic code and amplifies any matching fragments it finds The process also triggers and amplifies a fluorescent signal which gets picked up by the testing equipment The initial test had three parts The first two N1 and N2 aimed to identify parts of the genome specific to SarsCov2 The third part N3 was more generalaiming to pick up a section of the viral genome that existed in SarsCov2 as well as in other human and bat coronaviruses This more universal indicator was added in case the virus mutated POSITIVE NEGATIVE Before running the test on patient samples laboratory scientists run the tests on both a positive control and a negative control such as sterile water to ensure that the test works properly along with other validation steps The different combinations of sample types and test components are dropped into small circular wells or tubes that are loaded into the testing machine A nearby computer screen displays the data showing a moving line that tracks the level of light emerging from

and Prevention State and local publichealth officials were eager to get the kits and some pulled scientists in to work over the weekend of Saturday Feb 8 to speed the validation process That day Minnesota infectiousdisease lab manager nnnnnnnnnn      n      Sara Vetternnnn       was making decorations for her daughters Harry Pottertheme birthday party when a lab supervisor texted alerting her about a problem Lab specialists had put the test through a standard validation process including running it on confirmed positive virus samples and on a negative control sample such as sterile water to ensure it was working But in the third component the negative control was somehow turning up positive Dr Vetter soon heard grumblings from other publichealth labs showing they werent alone That gave us a little bit of comfort because at least we knew it wasnt just us she said But then we were left with this horrible feeling of what do we do  When New York states health department received the test that Saturday it found problems with the first and third parts of the test The testingchemical mixture was contaminated New York state health officials said later Jennifer RakemanCagnonnnn       director of the publichealth laboratory for the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene emailed the deputy commissioner that day saying the third sequence is coming up positive very late in the cycle on the negative controls This makes the test invalid This is being seen at multiple labs A spokesman for Dr RakemanCagno didnt respond to requests for comment Scott Beckernnnn       chief executive of the Association of Public Health Laboratories a nonprofit that represents state and local governmental health labs on Sunday morning Feb 9 saw his phone light up with emails from lab directors saying the tests werent working right This really cant be happening Mr Becker said he thought Our only tool was testing And otherwise we are flying blind The FDA learned Feb 10 that 10 of the publichealth labs found problems with the third test components accuracy said agency officials The Wall Street Journal is examining the causes of the coronavirus catastrophe and the bungled response that followed Taken by surprise the CDC set out to remake the third component a process that would take a week or more The agency was confident it could fix the test which worked in its own labs On Feb 11 the publiclab association told its members the CDC was remanufacturing the third component to ship out as a replacement Some labs that didnt encounter the problem started testing patients Most went on pause Mr Azar in a speech that day praised the tests saying these test kits are now available for order by US state and local publichealth laboratories Defense Department laboratories and select international laboratories CDC officials told publichealth lab representatives that the new component would be available the following week according to a Feb 12 written summary of a call between those parties By Feb 16 the FDA learned that 26 publichealth labs out of 100 had found problems said FDA officials Mr Azar wanted a fast solution said people familiar with the discussions In the Feb 18 meeting with Mr Azar at the HHS conference room nnnnnnnnnn      n      Daniel Jernigannnnn       who heads the CDCs influenza division told Mr Azar the CDC didnt know what was causing the problem in the third sequence said the attendee at the meeting which included officials from the National Institutes of Health the FDA and other agency leaders listening by phone What should US health agencies have done differently to make coronavirus testing available sooner Join the conversation below Mr Azar asked Well how important is it and Dr Jernigan responded that the sequence was essential the attendee said Thats when Mr Azar asked if the CDC could move more quickly Dr Jernigan didnt respond to requests for comment The CDCs Dr Redfield told Mr Azar the agency was working on a fix said people familiar with the discussions Over the following days Dr Redfield assured him they could remake the faulty third component they said Mr Azar initially didnt think a short testing delay would be a problem because he believed the risk of spread was low but he was frustrated and urged a fix people familiar with the discussions said Dr Redfield kept changing the timeline of when the test could be fixed people familiar with the discussions said pushing it later and later Mr Azar was told on Feb 18 the test might not be ready until March 12 they said On Feb 19 knowing that some labs had also had problems with the first component of the test the CDC told publichealth labs it would replace all the test chemicals and send out new kits according to a written summary of a call between the CDC and publichealth labs The CDC now said it couldnt say when the new kits would be ready By then lab specialists at the agency had tried at least two ways to manufacture a new third component according to a federal official But they couldnt get it to work That suggested that contamination might not be the problem Inside the agencys labs the mood shifted from confidence to feeling under pressure Meanwhile the virus was spreading Two people died at home on Feb 6 and Feb 17 in Santa Clara County Calif In April autopsies determined they were Covid19 positive Neither had any travel history About a million people gathered in New Orleans for Mardi Gras which fell on Feb 25 Attendees infected there seeded cases in other states CDC reports in April and May found Given continued problems with the third component officials worked on other options CDC scientists scrambled to analyze test data using just the first two components On Feb 21 it looked that one solution worked three days later it didnt said FDA officials Timothy Stenzelnnnn       the FDA official in charge of lab diagnostics flew to the CDCs Respiratory Virus Diagnostic Lab in Atlanta where the test was developed on Feb 22 What he saw there was alarming his boss nnnnnnnnnn      n      Jeffrey Shurennnnn       the FDAs medicaldevice center director said in a later HHS conference call recounted by a senior administration official In the call Dr Shuren described the lab as filthymeaning it had the potential to contaminatethe official said If it had been any other lab Dr Shuren told CDC officials on the call the FDA would have shut it down the official said FDA spokeswoman nnnnnnnnnn      n      Stephanie Caccomonnnn       declined to comment on the conference call Dr Stenzel concluded the tests design was probably adequate but something had gone wrong in the manufacture of its early version FDA officials said He didnt determine exactly what had gone wrong they said A later test made by commercial lab company nnnnnnnnnnn            Laboratory Corp of Americannn       used the same CDC design and didnt have the same accuracy problems the FDA officials said nnnnnnnnnnn            LabCorpnnn       developed its test with published information about the CDCs design and adapted it to work with different chemicals and on highthroughput instruments said nnnnnnnnnn      n      Pattie Kushnernnnn       LabCorps chief communications officer The test is highly accurate she said The CDC said in an article in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases that its test performed adequately in its own labs in January and February on nearly 3000 specimens Alarm about the virus and testing woes hit a crescendo in late February Mr Becker and nnnnnnnnnn      n      Grace Kubinnnnn

pleading with the commissioner to let publichealth labs bypass the authorization process and design and implement their own tests We are now many weeks into the response they wrote with still no diagnostic or surveillance test available outside of CDC for the vast majority of our member laboratories A turning point came Feb 25 when nnnnnnnnnn      n      Nancy Messonniernnnn       the CDCs top respiratorydiseases official said in a press call that community spread of the virus was a question of when not if and that disruption to everyday life could be severe The stock market cratered A furious President Trump called Mr Azar and considered having Dr Messonnier fired said people familiar with the discussion Mr Trump announced Vice President nnnnnnnnnn      n      Mike Pencennnn       would assume primary control of the task force The White House declined to comment On Feb 2618 days after the problem first emergedpublichealth labs began hearing the FDA was likely to let them use some version of the original test after all The subject line of an email that day from Dr Stenzel to the publiclab association read Do not destroy your current CDC 2019 nCoV Coronavirus EUA Kits and Please hold for additional follow on information Here we go again I hope we have not destroyed the earlier kit nnnnnnnnnn      n      Sandip Shahnnnn       director of Michigans state publichealth lab

nnnnnnnnnn      n      Scotty Smallsnnnn       didnt have essential childhood skills emailed you are killing me Smalls That day the FDA gave the goahead for the abbreviated testdropping the third componentafter determining it could work The HHS initiated a conference call with some members of the task force and Brian Harrison Mr Azars chief of staff said a person familiar with the discussion Mr Harrison urged them to get the remade CDC tests out quickly the person said The publichealth labs still would have to submit for and get FDA emergencyuse authorization for new tests of their own creation But they could do so in a single application Publichealth labs wanting to use the CDC kit could eliminate the third component and get started immediately From the beginning of the Covid19 response Secretary Azar and Brian Harrison insisted that accurate testing be widely proliferated as quickly as possible an HHS spokeswoman said on Mr Harrisons behalf On a Feb 26 call with the CDC FDA and other publichealth labs to go over the solution nnnnnnnnnn      n      Jill Taylornnnn       director of New Yorks Wadsworth Center the states research and publichealth laboratory expressed frustration at not having a usable test New York was among a small number of labs that would still have to wait for a new CDC test because it had not been able to get the first component to work This is completely unacceptable Dr Taylor said according to a person on the call We need to do something She told the FDA that Wadsworth had developed its own test The FDA promised to expedite a review New York state submitted on behalf of the state and New York City The FDA confirmed the account and a state healthdepartment spokesman said Dr Taylor verified the account Wadsworth officials had made their test because they worried it could take a long time to fix the CDC test and that materials would be in short supply said nnnnnnnnnn      n      Gareth Rhodesnnnn       a state official on New Yorks coronavirus task force in charge of testing At the time some federal officials continued to dismiss the severity of the crisisMr Trump in a Feb 26 press conference said that spread of the virus in the US wasnt inevitable and that the risk to the American public remains very low On Feb 27 the CDCs contractor produced the twocomponent test and shipped it to seven publichealth labs for validation to make sure it worked Once it did tests went out to 40 more publichealth labs on Feb 28 On Feb 29 FDA officials let hundreds of academic hospital labs know they could use their own tests and said the agency would give them retroactive proof of accuracy Within two weeks Roche Molecular Systems Inc had the first authorized commercial coronavirus test Companies including Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc nnnnnnnnnnn            Hologic Incnnn       and LabCorp quickly followed suit Testing exploded with labs able to test more than 100000 people a day by the end of March according to the Covid Tracking Project So did the number of infections detected The Life Care Center of Kirkland a nursing home in Kirkland Wash had noticed an outbreak of a severe respiratory illness and had notified the state Washington state began testing locally on Feb 28 The next day local and federal health officials reported two cases linked to the facility and the first known Covid19 death in the US New Yorks health department received FDA authorization for its test Feb 29 Within a couple of hours the state had its first positive case With the virus out of control the punishing nationwide

most intimate data about your health via sensors wearables machinelearning algorithms and datamining systems Though they promise to make health care more personalized our nonstop interactions with digital technologies and analytics are upending traditional notions of patient confidentiality In the US the core federal law restricting the use and protecting the disclosure of health data is the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act or HIPAA Congress enacted it in 1996 when much of the health system was paperbound and faxreliant The laws age is showing Its disclosure rules which took effect in 2003 dont apply to personal health data in general just the patient information flowing through the healthcare system Doctors hospitals pharmacies and health insurers are all bound by its requirements But technology companies offering healthrelated services via sensors apps and online portals may not be A look at how innovation and technology are transforming the way we live work and play Health policy experts say HIPAA may eventually be augmented or replaced by an overarching privacy law governing more than just health data like Europes General Data Protection Regulation Lawmakers in Congress have suggested other ways of filling in the gaps in HIPAA One proposal would prohibit tech companies from selling or sharing identifiable consumer health data stored on fitness trackers and health apps without users consent So far none of the halfdozen privacy protection measures proposed in Congress are near passage But experts expect the questions around HIPAA to take on more urgency in the coming years as more confidential health information spills outside the purview of the law New technologies and a greater awareness of public health after the pandemic could also fundamentally change our conception of health privacy making it less about keeping information private than controlling how it is used Generating a synthetic data set Synthetic data can start with information like electronic medical records that has been stripped of identifying details including age and gender and anonymized It can also be created from public databases like the Census or disease prevalence rates That collection of real data is scrambled or reconfigured to generate new populations of patients These replicas need to mimic the real patient populations statistically That means the demographics and patterns of diseases have to match But the resulting records for individual synthetic patients must be different To protect privacy each new patient reflects a random combination of characteristics from the original population pool Once new records are generated researchers test whether the insights their synthetic data yield match whats seen using public records or when available the original data from patients The goal is to generate a synthetic patient population that mimics a real one mathematically That way the insights should be comparable How developers

Dublin Mitre Alberto Cervantes Daniela Hernandez/THE WALL STREET JOURNAL What we think about health information is changing dramatically says Kirk Nahra a privacy and data security attorney who represents healthcare companies One concern is the proliferation of health and wellness consumer technologies Internetenabled devices and apps tracking our steps monitoring our heart rates and oxygen levels and sensing our emotions are generating masses of granular information about the mental and physical conditions of their users Health researchers see a future of smart homes constructed with mirrors that can detect skin abnormalities and heart conditions floors that can sense dizziness and unsteady gait mattresses that check vital signs and toilet seats that measure blood pressure Such sensitive bodily monitoring may not be subject to HIPAAs consent and disclosure requirements if the companies making the devices and analyzing the data operate outside the healthcare system The data gleaned from the technology could still be subject to other federal or state data regulations or a manufacturers own privacy policy Some health law observers say our everyday digital routines pose an even trickier issue for medical confidentiality A look at whats next for health The worlds largest tech companies including nnnnnnnnnnn            Alphabet Incsnnn       Google nnnnnnnnnnn            Microsoft Corpnnn       and nnnnnnnnnnn            Amazoncom Incnnn       are already plunging into the healthcare space Google for example is developing a search portal that doctors and nurses can use to diagnose diseases and has agreements with some hospital systems and providers that permit the company to access tens of millions of personally identifiable health records with little or no input from patients The huge data sets are helping to train machinelearning algorithms to recognize patterns in the clinical data Smarter artificial intelligence could help physicians better identify and even predict medical conditions Google has said its intentions in health are unconnected with its advertising business but the prospect of tech giants collecting troves of health records has raised concerns among lawmakers patients and doctors who fear the data could be used in unexpected ways Data mining could also expand the ability to infer health conditions from behavior and online activities that dont obviously have any medical connection Dr Mason Marks a health law professor at Gonzaga University labels these inferences emergent medical data It consists of millions of digital traces harvested from social media accounts and devices like wearables that are plugged into algorithms to predict conditions like suicidal depression or alcoholism Already nnnnnnnnnnn            Facebooknnn      deploys an AI system programmed to identify potential suicidal language Do you see benefits to letting go of some privacy around healthcare information Join the conversation below Data mining has the potential to improve health screening facilitate medical research and better our understanding of diseases But emergent medical data is largely unregulated Dr Marks says and could also be used for consumer profiling and marketing purposes and to discriminate against people flagged by the algorithms He says he favors a privacy law that treats such health inferences the same as traditional medical data Companies and governments shouldnt be able to collect health information out of thin air he says Public sentiment could also shape health privacy laws The US legal system has long viewed health care as a domain requiring exceptional privacy protections says Nicolas Terry executive director of the Hall Center for Law and Health at Indiana University The Covid19 crisis could help give rise to a solidaritybased health care that puts less emphasis on individual privacy rights and more on public health Personal health information would become less proprietary and treated more like societys data gathered for the wellbeing of the whole herd Prof Terry says Such a shift could loosen privacy regulations around medical research and give scientists freer access to personal health information Concerns about HIPAA could also be addressed by putting in place broader antidiscrimination protections making it unlawful to use the information to deny access to housing employment or for targeted advertising Another approach is to give consumers more control over what kinds of data can be collected and how it is used For example the users of social media platforms could be presented with a menu of options that include predictions about selfharm substance abuse mental health conditions and physical health conditions wrote Dr Marks in a recent paper Users could have the option of participating in different health surveillance programs or decide whether they want their information used for other purposes like targeted advertising Facebook users he wrote could be asked to opt in to suicide screening and choose whether to notify friends or family or dispatch first responders to the home if a suicide risk is detected from their online activity HIPAA worked fairly well back when it was written when medical records were stored in paper charts says Dr Marks But today in the Information Age we need something new Write to Jacob Gershman at

there is a broad recognition in the Democratic Party that Trump was largely accurate in diagnosing Chinas predatory practices says nnnnnnnnnn      n      Kurt Campbellnnnn       the top Asia official in the Obama State Department now a senior adviser to the Biden campaign Biden aides say they would expand the Americangovernmentbacked campaign to compete in strategic hightech sectors such as artificial intelligence quantum computing and the nextgeneration 5G wireless standard These policies are meant to curb Chinese economic power and influence and reduce interdependence Mr Trumps tariffs also could remain under a President Biden While Mr Biden has criticized the Trump trade war as selfdestructive the campaign has refused to pledge removing the levies saying only they would be reevaluated Democrats in Congress say they would pressure him to keep some tariffs in place to protect American workers But the two candidates are sending different signals on tactics and messaging Biden advisers dismiss as unrealistic the rhetoric of some Trump backers about a new Cold War along the lines of the standoff between the US and Soviet Union They note more than 500 billion in goods crossed the Pacific between the two countries last year even during the trade war nnnnnnnnnnn            Apple Incnnn       for instance still relies heavily on Chinese producers for key components of its iPhones They also criticize the way that President Trump has gone about confronting China The application of his strategy to negotiate and contend with them has just been a mess said Mr Campbell The Trump team argues that Mr Biden represents the longtime establishment that encouraged Chinas rise in the first place including fostering a global freetrade system that many Americans now blame for hurting US factory jobs In 2000 as one of the most influential lawmakers on international policy Mr Biden used his clout to back nnnnnnnnnn      n      Bill Clintonsnnnn       deal letting China into the World Trade Organization Should the US continue taking a harder line on China Join the conversation below nnnnnnnnnn      Donald Trumpn      nnnn       has been fearless incleaning up the mess made by career politicians like Biden said Michigan Republican Rep Jack Bergman during a Trump campaign call Wednesday on the escalating China debate He said Mr Biden despite his new rhetoric cant break from the old mindset A more bareknuckled China policy also would represent a notable shift for Mr Biden and his foreignpolicy team Most of them served in the Obama administration which some say in retrospect was too soft on China and too slow to recognize President nnnnnnnnnn      n      Xi Jinpingsnnnn       nationalist and authoritarian bent Mr Biden says he would work more closely than Mr Trump has to rally allies in a coordinated global campaign to pressure Beijing He says Mr Trumps efforts would be far more effective if he worked with other countries rather than simultaneously engaging in trade fights with Europe Canada Mexico South Korea and Japan We make up 25 of the worlds economy but we poked our finger in the eyes of all of our allies out there Mr Biden said recently The way China will respond is when we gather the rest of the world Mr Biden also says he would place a higher emphasis than Mr Trump on cooperating with China on global challenges he considers as vital to American interests as confronting Beijing Where Mr Trump has this year tried to isolate China over the pandemicand the World Health Organization over its ties to ChinaMr Biden would likely take a more global approach to containing the virus Where Mr Trump plays down concerns over climate change Mr Biden calls it an existential threat Mr Biden cant address his climate agenda without help from China the worlds largest carbon emitter That could complicate any attempts to strike a harder line against Beijing Should there be an easing up of competition if theres a prospect of cooperation What if China links those two asks nnnnnnnnnn      n      Thomas Wrightnnnn       a foreignpolicy fellow at the Brookings Institution The candidates contrasting diplomatic approaches reflect their clashing governing philosophies Mr Biden spent much of his four decades in government working with world leaders to help shape the modern Americanled global order Mr Trumps latelife entry into politics was animated by his opposition to that order He has at times questioned the value of longtime military and trade relations with Japan and South Korea two American allies in Chinas orbit For more than four decades presidents from both parties joined by executives of multinational corporations sought to encourage Chinas integration with the US and the world They argued that would benefit the US and would lead to greater openness as Beijing followed global rules President Obama began his term seeking closer ties with Beijing and asked his vice president to develop a relationship with Mr Xi Mr Biden boasts about having spent more time with the Chinese leader than any other foreign official saying the two had 25 hours of private meals and logged 24000 miles of travel together It is in our selfinterest that China continue to prosper Mr Biden said during a 2011 visit to the country a quote cited often by the Trump campaign Biden supporters say Mr Trump has made similar comments as president The ObamaBiden administrations early views on China had been based on assumptions that Mr Xi would continue the marketliberalizing policies of his predecessors As the Chinese leader consolidated power and reversed many of those measures officials say their views on China changed Biden aides say he observed firsthand the increasingly autocratic tendencies of Mr Xi and other Chinese leaders In a 2013 meeting aides say he told Mr Xi the US would ignore Beijings attempt to expand its air defense zone and would back allies doing the same Some critics at the time said Mr Biden should have publicly demanded China remove the zone which he didnt do on that trip Near the end of Mr Obamas term the US began to crack down on cybertheft challenged Chinese territorial claims in the South China Sea and tightened scrutiny of Chinese investment in US technology Mr Biden took the lead in criticizing Chinese trade practicesthough the administrations actions consisted mainly of filing complaints with the World Trade Organization in Geneva President Trump accelerated the turn against China He blasted the WTO as too slow and weak and launched a trade war that imposed tariffs on 370 billion of Chinese imports He has curbed Chinese tech companies including Huawei Technologies Co and ByteDance Ltds TikTok The pressure campaign expanded in the Covid19 pandemic which Mr Trump blames on China The US has closed the Chinese consulate in Houston for alleged economic espionage ramped up military exercises in the South China Sea and imposed sanctions on senior Chinese officials In the six months since Mr Biden effectively sealed the Democratic nomination the incumbent and challenger have traded barbs on China Each campaign has produced video ads featuring footage of the opposing candidate meeting with Mr Xi Biden stands up for China the Trump ad says Trump rolled over for the Chinese counters the Biden spot The new Washington consensus no longer sees China on a path to adopting Western political and economic systems but rather as an authoritarian rival The hostility isnt just over trade but also stems from the crackdown in Hong Kong and repression of Uighur Muslims Regardless of who wins US policy toward China is going to be tougher over the next five years than the last five years says nnnnnnnnnn      n      Richard Haassnnnn       a State Department official in the George W Bush administration now president of the Council on Foreign Relations China has changed and US thinking on China has changed Lawmakers have introduced more than 200 bills addressing China in the current congressional session double the number in the previous one In a summer Pew Research Center poll 73 of Americans said they had an unfavorable view of China just 22 a favorable one In 2011 51 had a positive view 36 a negative one The Chinese peoplefeel very disappointed about what is happening in this country towards China theres a rising anger among the Chinese public nnnnnnnnnn      n      Cui Tiankainnnn       Chinas ambassador to the US told the annual Aspen Security Forum last month He said leaders need to not allow any miscalculation or misperceptions to hijack the relations One Biden critique of the Trump China policy is that it has inflicted economic damage on the US without triggering the Chinese economic reforms Mr Trump has demanded The fallout to the US has included a plunge in agricultural exports as well as higher costs and supply disruptions for US companies dependent on Chinese imports A Moodys Analytics study late last year estimated the China trade war cost the US economy about 300000 jobs and shaved 03 off US gross domestic product Trump officials say much of the lost sales will ultimately be made up with China purchase pledges made in a January trade agreement Biden advisers see China policy as just as much about rebuilding the US economy as containing Chinas The debate should be about whos going to make America more competitive says Ely Ratner a Biden national security aide in the Obama administration now at the Center for a New American Security America policy makers have long tried to coax Beijing to move toward Americanstyle capitalism If elected Mr Bidens plans to bolster growth include a nod to Chinesestyle state intervention He has an ambitious Buy American proposal that would earmark more federal funds for US companies Mr Biden says his China policy would include a heavy emphasis on promoting democracy and human rights He sees this as enabling the US to compete with Beijing globally on values not just commerce a traditional American foreignpolicy framework that Mr Trump has played down That would also inform Mr Bidens technology policies As the vice president sees it theres a division in the world between technodemocracies and technoautocracies said Antony Blinken the campaigns senior foreignpolicy adviser The democracies see technology as a tool for fostering greater freedom the autocracies sell dictators enhanced surveillance and censorship tools A President Biden would have to manage divisions among Democrats over how to confront China One battle within the party is over the military One side wants big Pentagon budget cuts and the other hopes for more military support for Asian allies Another fight looms over trade Many Democrats oppose new freetrade agreements Others say those pacts are vital to bolstering alliances to counter China At the end of his term Mr Obama negotiated the 12nation Trans Pacific Partnership with that goal in mind At the time Mr Biden supported it Mr Trump ran against TPP in his 2016 campaign and pulled the US out Now the Biden campaign says rejoining the bloc isnt a top priority Write to Jacob M Schlesinger at

notice to Mr Trumps tweet comparing Covid19 to the flu saying it violated the Twitter Rules about spreading misleading and potentially harmful information related to Covid19nnnnnnnnnnn            Facebooknnn      removed the presidents post on its platform a Facebook spokesman said calling the post incorrect The White House didnt respond to a request for comment on the Twitter and Facebook moves Medical experts say the risk from the virus is very real especially for older people and people with preexisting health problems Researchers estimate Covid19 is about six times as deadly as the seasonal flu and can also cause longterm health problems such as lung damage There is a seasonal vaccine for the flu which is partly effective while Covid19 vaccines remain in development Health experts have been urging Americans to get their flu shots to reduce the number of cases this winter The CDC in preliminary estimates said 38 million Americans got the flu in the 201920 season and 22000 died In the particularly harsh 201718 season about 61000 people died according to CDC estimates So far more than 210000 Americans have died from Covid19 this year according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University even as most people have sharply restricted their movements and interactions Mr Trump has repeatedly pressed states and cities to roll back restrictions on businesses and to reopen schools after closures related to the outbreak last spring pummeled the economy and upended education and child care But continued new cases in much of the country have slowed the return to normalcy with restaurants retailers and other businesses struggling to remain viable Mr Trumps decision to continue dismissing a virus for which he was hospitalized for three days signaled he didnt intend to change his message on the virus When he returned to the White House on Monday after receiving a level of care unavailable to most Americans he took off his mask as he posed for pictures on a balcony The president was isolated in the White House residence not the West Wing where many senior aides work Aides have set up office space for him in the residence but it isnt known if the president will remain there Doctors say his condition is improving but declined to detail additional measures put in place at the White House to protect staff First lady Melania Trump who was also infected continues to rest and is doing well an aide said Her office on Tuesday released a memo outlining the precautions the White House is taking in the residence including requiring residence staff to wear masks testing any staff in direct contact with the first family daily and hiring a wellbeing consultant to talk to staffers about their mentalhealth concerns  On Tuesday several aides in the West Wing and all East Wing staffers worked from home giving the White House an eerily quiet atmosphere even after the president had returned to the residence administration officials said Mr Biden said that he was glad Mr Trump seems to be coming along pretty well but that he hoped the president would communicate the right lesson to the American people Masks matter Vice Presidentnnnnnnnnnn      n      Mike Pencennnn      arrived in Salt Lake City on Monday ahead of the vicepresidential debate set for Wednesday The debate has taken on new importance after Mr Trumps hospitalization forced officials to cancel rallies and elevated the vice presidents role in the campaign White House physician Jesse Schonau in a memo Tuesday said Mr Pence remained symptomfree and had tested negative for Covid19 and was encouraged to go about his normal activities and does not need to quarantine While the White House has said Mr Pence remains healthy some have raised concern about sending Mr Pencewho

of the economy to Paulo Guedes a University of Chicagotrained investment banker who promised privatizations and cutbacks to correct years of overspending by the political left That was the plan Then the Covid19 pandemic hit Brazil went on a spending spree that is one of the most generous of any developing nation but puts at risk the public finances of a country that has long teetered on the edge of a fiscal crisis Brazil is facing a budget shortfall this year of more than 12 of gross domestic product and public debt is on course to end this year at as much as 100 of GDP up from 76 last year and far higher than the South American average As the disease has ravaged the country killing more than 160000 Brazilians Mr Bolsonaro has been giving out as much as 10 billion a month to help the poor and shore up his popularity Privatizations have been put on hold The handouts have lifted Mr Bolsonaros approval ratings to a record high even as he faces widespread criticism from health experts over his handling of the pandemic For Mr Guedes a crusader for small government and free markets the level of spending is new and dangerous territory Ballooning government debt threatens to spur inflation and an exodus from Brazilian assets which would be disastrous for longterm growth according to economists We know we are going into the jungle for a while but we will be back Mr Guedes Brazils economy minister told The Wall Street Journal in an interview saying the country would soon return to the administrations original plan to reduce the role of the state in Brazilians lives Some investors arent convinced While bankers investors and others in Brazils financial markets said they havent lost faith in Mr Guedes himself they are beginning to question whether the president who has acknowledged he knows little about economics is still listening The populist leader has already talked about introducing a new permanent socialwelfare program to replace Bolsa Famlia the widely praised monthly stipend for the poor That is raising fears among investors that the president is giving priority to votes over financial stability as Brazils municipal elections this month draw near The market is worried and bracing for the fiscal situation to worsen said Marco Saravalle a So Paulobased investment strategist While Mr Bolsonaro had been focusing on job creation to cement his popularity seemingly adopting the proverb that it is better to teach a man to fish than to give him handouts the pandemic changed that said Mr Saravalle The president decided to give him the fish instead he added Some investors worry it is only a matter of time before Mr Guedes quits or is fired Since Mr Bolsonaro took office in January last year almost a dozen ministers have either resigned or been fired from his cabinet as the fiery exarmy captain has relied ever more on loyal former members of the military to help him run the government In August two members of the finance ministers economic team responsible for privatizations and debureaucratization resigned in frustration over the pace of their projects  Mr Guedes 71 years old said that he wont be fired and has no intention of leaving The president supports methat hasnt changed he said A son of middleclass parents and a cofounder of what became Latin Americas largest investment bank BTG Pactual Mr Guedes said he joined Mr Bolsonaros government because he saw a chance to implement policies inspired by the likes of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher to reduce the size of Brazils government His support during Mr Bolsonaros election campaign was crucial to gaining the votes of centrists and business leaders sealing the conservatives victory He praised Mr Bolsonaros refusal to resort to porkbarrel politics and his frankness Hes blunt and so am I said Mr Guedes Both men strained relations with France last year by calling the French first lady Brigitte Macron ugly Mr Guedes also stoked controversy at home this year by referring to Brazils public servants as parasites Mr Guedes apologized for both incidents saying he didnt mean to offend anyone Mr Guedes said he had initially proposed cash handouts during the pandemic of about 35 a month but met resistance from Congress and Mr Bolsonaro who likes to call him by his initials PG The president told me PG stop being so stingy Mr Guedes said The administration eventually settled on triple Mr Guedess suggestion paying 105 a month from April to September to about 66 million Brazilians one of the most generous responses to the pandemic in the region Under pressure from voters Mr Bolsonaro extended the program for another four months until December but halved the payouts to just over 50 The spending which Mr Guedes tried to limit has allowed Brazil to weather the worst of the economic fallout from the pandemic After a near10 contraction in the second quarter Brazils economy is poised for something of a Vshaped recovery he said The spending has even allowed poverty rates in Brazil to fall But Mr Guedes knows the fix is only temporary We need to get back to the structural reforms to make sure that the spending increase was transitory not permanent he said The government has been planning to overhaul the tax system to make it more businessfriendly and sell off state assets such as the power companynnnnnnnnnnn            Eletrobrasnnn      and the countrys mail service Correios Brazil is also poised to approve legislation in coming weeks to make the central bank independent he said When he took the role Mr Guedes promised the country wouldnt need to break its allimportant spending cap In 2016 Brazil passed a constitutional amendment that effectively freezes federal funding for the next two decades in line with inflationa vital fiscal anchor for a country where politicians have often spent their way out of political crises This years expenditure at the height of the pandemic wont count toward the spending cap because that is considered an emergency But if Mr Bolsonaro insists on maintaining the payments into next year it will be harder to justify their exclusion likely breaking the cap economists said Andr Perfeito chief economist at the So Paulobased brokerage Necton said he believes Brazils economic recovery will be slower than that predicted by Mr Guedes and that the countrys spending cap will likely be broken The whole political class is in a tough spot said Mr Perfeito It will be hard to wean millions of Brazilians off the emergency handouts especially as unemployment remains high while public services will face more demand next year as cashstrapped Brazilians rely ever more on publichealth services and schools A second wave of Covid19 infections could also slow the recovery and increase public expenditure he said Write to Luciana Magalhaes at LucianaMagalhaeswsjcom and Samantha Pearson at samanthapearsonwsjcom Copyright 2020 Dow Jones  Company Inc All Rights Reserved

critics of the Supreme Court on Thursday calling a 2019 brief filed by five Democratic senators an affront to the Constitution and the rule of law for suggesting that the court is a sick institution that may need to be restructured Lets go back to some basics the Supreme Court was created by the Constitution not by Congress and under the Constitution we exercise the judicial power of the United States Justice Alito said in remarks to the Federalist Societys National Lawyers Convention The society is a conservative lawyers network whose membersincluding former White House counselnnnnnnnnnn      n      Don McGahnnnnn      have dominated judicial appointments and legal policy during the Trump administration Congress has no right to interfere with that work any more than we have the right to legislate Justice Alito said In a halfhour virtual address Justice Alito portrayed a world where conservative thought faced repression on university campuses and in corporate workplaces as oncewidespread moral values are suddenly considered retrograde by mainstream societys embrace of LGBT rights You cant say that marriage is a union between one man and one woman any more Justice Alito

criticized the Federalist Society and other pillars of the conservative legal movement for their influence on the courts With bare partisan majorities the Court has influenced sensitive areas like

influence effort surrounding the court chronicled in our welldocumented Captured Courts report he said referring to a paper Senate Democrats published in May The fiveday lawyers convention normally held at Washingtons opulent Mayflower Hotel instead is taking place over Zoom Justice Alito acknowledged the seriousness of the coronavirus pandemic which has driven the Supreme Court to meet via teleconference rather than in its marble courthouse He criticized some publichealth orders issued by state governors as executive overreach that infringed on individual rights and when limiting attendance at church services a threat to religious liberty The pandemic has resulted in previously unimaginable restrictions on individual liberty Justice Alito said after expressing concerns that his comments might be twisted or misunderstood The Covid crisis has served as a sort of constitutional stress test and in doing so it has highlighted disturbing trends that were already present before the virus struck he said noting that many restrictions were issued by executive fiat rather than through legislation Justice Alito linked that phenomenon to historical movements that by definition conservatives oppose The vision of early 20th century progressives and the New Dealers of the 1930s was that policymaking would shift from narrowminded elected legislators to an elite group of appointed experts Justice Alito said That dream has been realized to a large extent he said Just as the Covid restrictions have highlighted the movement toward rule by experts litigation about those restrictions has pointed up emerging trends in the assessment of individual rights Justice Alito said This is especially evident with respect to religious liberty It pains me to say this but in certain quarters religious liberty is fast becoming a disfavored right Earlier this year the Supreme Court rejected claims by churches in California and Nevada that publichealth orders capping attendance at services were discriminatory because some other places where people gatherincluding casinos in Las Vegaswere permitted to admit larger numbers Those decisions saw Chief Justicennnnnnnnnn      n      John Robertsnnnn      join four liberal justices to let the public health orders stand over the dissent of Justice Alito and three other conservatives In published opinions accompanying

states where coronavirus cases are surgingand in places where they are not The growth in the number of daily job postings in Midwestern states where the virus is raging is slowing sharply compared with October according to data from the job site ZipRecruiter But other states with among the lowest virus infection rates in the nation including California New York and North Carolina are also seeing a slowdown The regional data suggest it is not the level of Covid19 infections but how state officials businesses and consumers respond to the pandemic that appears to have the greater impact on the pace of the labor markets recovery in a state The relationship between Covid cases and labormarket outcomes is complicated by the fact that its mediated by peoples individual decisionsand policy makers decisions said Julia Pollak labor economist at ZipRecruiter Political views regarding the virus are key to driving decision making among consumers and policy makers Republicans are much less likely to be worried about the virus than Democrats according to polling by Gallup That suggests consumers are more likely to venture out in Republicanleaning states despite virus risks Republican governors too have been less likely than Democrats to impose restrictions on businesses and individuals such as requiring social distancing or mask wearing Virus cases are rising in nearly every state but to varying degrees Many states led by Democratic governors including New York Maine and North Carolina logged the lowest rates of coronavirus cases in the past week and they have also been quick to reinstate restrictions or roll back reopenings as cases increase The latest economic news analysis and data curated weekdays by WSJ's Jeffrey Sparshott In recent weeks New York state set a curfew for bars restaurants and gyms New York Citys mayor warned that gyms and indoor dining may close and the city also temporarily closed schools and switched to fully remote learning Maine postponed the reopening of indoor services at bars and tasting rooms North Carolina imposed new limits on private social gatherings The number of job openings and hours worked have recently pulled

the Covid19 vaccines it had originally planned for this year the decision highlighted the challenges drug makers face in rapidly building supply chains to meet the high demand Scaling up the raw material supply chain took longer than expected a company spokeswoman said And its important to highlight that the outcome of the clinical trial was somewhat later than the initial projection Top news

Germanybased partnernnnnnnnnnnn            BioNTech SEnnn      had hoped to roll out 100 million vaccines worldwide by the end of this year a plan that was reduced to 50 million on Nov 9 The UK on Wednesday granted emergencyuse authorization for the vaccine becoming the first Western country to start administering doses The twoshot vaccine also is being reviewed by the Food and Drug

Massbasednnnnnnnnnnn            Moderna Incnnn      that could begin shipping before Christmas The doses are among an array of vaccines that have been developed this year as the coronavirus pandemic has raged across much of the world Authorities estimate nearly 15 million people worldwide have died from the virus including 273836 in the US as of Dec 2 Pfizer had its 100million dose goal in place until midNovember when it became clear the supplychain hurdles were too great for the endoftheyear timeline Pfizer on Nov 9 in announcing the vaccine candidate the company and BioNTech had developed had proven more than 90 effective in preventing Covid19 in trial participants said it expects to produce globally up to 50 million vaccine doses in 2020 and up to 13 billion doses in 2021 That was a step back from its earlier projections for output by the end of the year We were late said a person directly involved in the development of the Pfizer vaccine Some early batches of the raw materials failed to meet the standards We fixed it but ran out of time to meet this years projected shipments Pfizer sources its raw materials from providers in the US and Europe Scaling up production of these components proved challenging last month as the company awaited the results of its trials which came in to be 95 effective and welltolerated in a 44000subject trial Pfizer wouldnt say where shortfalls over ingredients arose as it ramped up production Vaccines typically contain materials from suppliers that can include antivirus agents antiseptic liquids sterile water and elements of the DNA of the virus itself that wont cause serious symptoms but trigger the immune system to make antibodies In a typical vaccination campaign pharmaceutical companies would wait until their product is approved before buying raw materials establishing manufacturing lines and setting up supply chains to ship a vaccine Pfizer has never manufactured a vaccine with technology that uses mRNA the molecular couriers that carry genetic instructions to cells in the human body so it has had to scale up production capacity even as research was still under way For this one everything happened simultaneously the person familiar with the Pfizer development said We started setting up the supply chain in March while the vaccine was still being developed Thats totally unprecedented Pfizer and BioNtech are still on track to roll out 13 billion vaccines in 2021 and the 50 million dose shortfall this year will be covered in 2021 as production ramps up The company is setting up what it has described as its biggest ever vaccination campaign through two final assembly and distribution centers in Kalamazoo Mich and Puurs Belgium which will handle the European supply The UK authorization marks a milestone in the effort to develop apromising new vaccine technology into a widely available shot in record time The UK ordered 40 million Pfizer doses enough to vaccinate 20 million people The government said in November that it could get up to 10 million doses this year but the expectation is that four to five million vaccines will be shipped  UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the shots will be rolled out as quickly as they can be made at Pfizers Belgium plant Some 800000 are due in the coming days and several millions throughout December he said The US government has placed an initial order for 100 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine with the option to purchase 500 million additional doses The EU ordered 200 million doses with an option for another 100 million Japan ordered 120 million doses

https//wwwwsjcom/articles/redditclaims52milliondailyusersrevealingakeyfigureforsocialmediaplatforms11606822200 Reddit Inc said it averaged 52 million daily active users in October up 44 from the same month a year earlier disclosing for the first time a metric used by other socialmedia companies to define the size of their audiences Reddit hosts message boards for users on seemingly countless subjects The company which was founded in 2005 and is based in San Francisco is also known for its ask me anything digital town halls with celebrities and politicians It described its daily user count amid a continuing effort to attract more advertisers to its platform which most marketers consider experimental Were sharing daily active users for the first time as a more accurate reflection of our user growth and to be more inline with industry reporting saidnnnnnnnnnn      n      Jen Wongnnnn      chief operating officer of Reddit Were focused on daily usership and increasing this number as we continue to grow our community and scale our advertising business Reddits number pales compared with that ofnnnnnnnnnnn            Facebook Incnnn      which said it averaged 182 billion daily active users on its namesake social network in September and is less than a third that ofnnnnnnnnnnn            Twitter Incnnn      which said it averaged 187 million monetizable daily users in the third quarter But Reddit said growth in the ranks of its users has coincided with growth in its advertising business The companys ad revenue totaled more than 100 million in 2019 and is on track to rise by more than 70 this year according to Ms Wong CMO Today delivers the most important news of the day for media and marketing professionals A throttling of ad spending caused by the coronavirus pandemic hurt Reddits business in the second quarterwhen yearoveryear directad revenue growth fell to 27 from 40 in the first quarterbut it has since rebounded growing by 83 yearoveryear in the third quarter Ms Wong said Direct ad revenues are based on deals conducted by Reddits sales team and dont include revenues from advertising bought and sold through outside automated platforms Like with everybody in the ads business its been a volatile year she said adding that while Reddit isnt profitable it is making significant investments Reddit is in the experimental bucket of budgets for advertising by companies in such categories as gaming technology entertainment finance and beauty saidnnnnnnnnnn      n      Susan Schiekofernnnn      chief digital investment officer for adbuying giant GroupM which is owned by adholding companynnnnnnnnnnn            WPPnnn      PLC If we are comparing them to the big onesSnap Twitter Facebook Instagramthey are not anywhere near that scale she said But the upside for them is really big GroupM has more than 10 clients currently advertising on Reddit and that number continues to grow Ms Schiekofer said Reddits big challenge will be in bringing more advertisers across categories to come on board and feel comfortable advertising on its platform she added Like Twitter and Facebookwhich recently faced a boycott from some advertisers over its policies for handling hate speech and misinformationReddit has hosted unwelcome content posted by some of its users  Would I necessarily advise clients to lean right away into their top10 fastestgrowing categories Ms Schiekofer said Its a similar story to other platformstheir triedandtrue communities are generally safer than something thats upandcoming that we have not vetted yet With these platforms if you want to look for something thats brandunsafe you can find it Ms Wong said Reddit has taken efforts to ensure ads dont appear next to content or conversations that advertising clients may deem objectionable including by handselecting which communities serve ads Reddit also offers three tiers of ad inventoryexpanded standard and limitedthat advertisers can choose from to suit their comfort level and offers clients the option to disable comments on their ads and to keep the ads away from certain keywords and communities More advertisers want the expanded and standard inventory than the limited inventory despite how important brand safety is Ms Wong said Ms Wong said Reddits future revenue growth will come partly by expanding the companys ad business to new international markets Reddit announced an operations team in London in September and will seek to open offices in three to five countries every year initially targeting countries in Europe the Middle East and Africa she added The company also aims for its sales force to employ around 300 people worldwide by the end of 2020 with plans to grow head count by 75 over the next year Ms Wong said For building this business its trying to explain what Reddit is about which is a big mission around community and belonging and explaining Reddits role in the future of the internet which I think is really big but its not always as top of mind with people as if you had a big shiny new thing she said Write to Sahil Patel at sahilpatelwsjcom Copyright 2020 Dow Jones  Company Inc All Rights Reserved

are treating a new flood of critically ill coronavirus patients with treatments from before the pandemic to keep more patients alive and send them home sooner Last spring with less known about the disease doctors often preemptively put patients on ventilators or gave powerful sedatives largely abandoned in recent years The aim was to save the seriously ill and protect hospital staff from Covid19 Now hospital treatment for the most critically ill looks more like it did before the pandemic Doctors hold off longer before placing patients on ventilators Patients get less powerful sedatives with doctors checking more frequently to see if they can halt the drugs entirely and dialing back how much air ventilators push into patients lungs with each breath Let us go back to basics said nnnnnnnnnn      n      Dr Eduardo Oliveirannnn       executive medical director for criticalcare services for AdventHealth Central Florida which recommends its doctors stick with prepandemic guidelines for ventilator use The less you deviate from it the better Advances also include new drugs most notably steroids for severely ill patients As the US surge stretches into winter hospital ICUs are seeing record numbers of Covid19 cases Even with more effective treatment the high volume has required a record number of them on ventilators in the US last week according to Covid Tracking Project data Vaccines began distribution in the US last week but shots for most Americans remain months away The disease has killed 168 million worldwide according to Johns Hopkins University Last spring doctors put patients on ventilators partly to limit contagion at a time when it was less clear how the virus spread when protective masks and gowns were in short supply Doctors could have employed other kinds of breathing support devices that dont require risky sedation but early reports suggested patients using them could spray dangerous amounts of virus into the air said nnnnnnnnnn      n      Theodore Iwashynannnn       a criticalcare physician at University of Michigan and Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals in Ann Arbor Mich At the time he said doctors and nurses feared the virus would spread through hospitals We were intubating sick patients very early Not for the patients benefit but in order to control the epidemic and to save other patients Dr Iwashyna said That felt awful Ventilators can injure lungs by causing too much strain as the machines force in air They deliver air and oxygen through a throat tube which the body typically fights Weve got gag reflexes that are pretty hard to go away precisely to avoid things going into our lungs Dr Iwashyna said As a safety precaution doctors and hospitals limited the access of healthcare workers to coronavirus patients on ventilators giving them fewer opportunities to check on them That meant patients required more powerful sedatives to keep them from pulling out throat tubes Sedation increases risk for delirium research suggests and delirium increases the likelihood of longterm confusion and death Subsequent research found the alternative devices to ventilators such as delivering oxygen through nasal tubes werent as risky to caretakers as believed Doctors also gained experience with Covid19 patients learning to spot signs of who might suddenly turn seriously ill some said When the pandemic first overwhelmed hospitals in China and Italy doctors questioned whether Covid19 would require new treatment approaches Better understanding of severely ill coronavirus patients in respiratory distress has increased confidence that they are similar enough to patients with other infections to rely on prepandemic guidelines for ventilators according to doctors and hospitals Doctors at AdventHealth Central Florida use computers to select treatment options and for Covid19 patients the system added options to calibrate ventilators using longstanding protocols Dr Oliveira said The computerized guides have helped spread the use of prepandemic treatment options such as the amount of air to push into lungs per breath across its 20 hospitals and emergency rooms Dr Oliveria said Nashvillebased nnnnnnnnnnn            HCA Healthcare Incnnn       one of the largest hospital chains in the US went a step further Doctors get an alert from computers when patients arent getting the ventilator treatment that might benefit them The company rolled out the alerts in June Afterward it compared treatment and outcomes for similar patients before and after the alerts It found more doctors now follow the prepandemic protocols which have reduced the number of deaths and shortened the time patients spend on ventilators HCAs chief medical officer said Overall survival for Covid19 patients increased 28 from April to September at HCA hospitals though the company didnt break out figures for ventilated patients Doctors can use their judgment to ignore the alerts when other patient conditions make it medically necessary the company said Researchers and doctors continue to study Covid19 patients who require ventilators and some experts have called for flexibility from prepandemic standards for doctors to decide how to calibrate ventilators Its personalization thats the key word said nnnnnnnnnn      n      John Marininnnn       a professor of medicine at the University of Minnesota Guidelines are just guidelines How have you seen ways the new Covid19 surge has affected your communityJoin the conversation below Before the pandemic between about 30 to more than 40 of ventilator patients died according to research Numbers were sharply higher in the pandemics early hot spot in Wuhan China As the pandemic grew hospitals in the US reported death rates in some cases of about 50 for ventilated Covid19 patients One study of three New York City hospitals found the death rate for all Covid19 patients dropped to 76 from 256 between March and August after accounting for younger healthier patients in the summer Hospitals in New York were less crowded in August than during the April surge which could increase mortality the studys authors wrote in October in the Journal of Hospital Medicine The study also suggests patients may have benefited from new medications and improved treatment they said Gains in treatment may diminish in a prolonged Covid19 surge if doctors and nurses are overwhelmed and hospitals must keep out visitors said nnnnnnnnnn      n      E Wesley Elynnnn       a professor at the Vanderbilt School of Medicine who studies the risks of intensivecare treatment which include neurological damage and physical disability Overextended doctors may again use heavy sedation if ICU teams cant closely monitor ventilated patients Dr Ely said Less sedation combined with other measures also shortens hospital stays and improves survival research shows Among those measures halting intravenous drugs for portions of each day to see if they are still needed attempting daily to remove patients from ventilators and keeping patients moving Contact with family also plays a significant role in recovery research shows Christopher Thomasnnnn       a physician and assistant professor of clinical medicine and pulmonary and critical care with Louisiana State University Health used heavy sedation on patients for a few weeks in the spring It wasnt his normal practice It felt like you were watchingbeing forced to watchpatients not get better Dr Thomas said He soon reverted to lighter sedation Baton Rouge General where Dr Thomas works had also prohibited family visits to reduce contagion In August doctors decided it would be better to allow families to visit delirious patients to help with recovery the usual practice before the pandemic We tried iPads FaceTime Dr Thomas said but decided that inperson was essential for some patients Deborah Walkernnnn       couldnt visit her husband nnnnnnnnnn      n      Ralph Walker Srnnnn       for weeks after he entered the Baton Rouge La hospital in midJuly He was dizzy nauseous and feverish Doctors put him on a ventilator Ms Walker forbidden from visiting spoke to and prayed for husband daily over an iPad Please come home she would say and she promised him he could buy a guitar he wanted Mr Walker already had 10 guitars hanging on the walls of the couples home in a Baton Rouge suburb He also plays pianothey own twoand a drum kit is set up in the dining room The night the couple met Ralph sang to his future wife from the stage of a bar where he played Doctors halted Mr Walkers sedatives in early August but he was largely unresponsive for about two weeks Ms Walker said She first saw him open his eyes on Aug 17 He said little for days Doctors let two family members visit hoping to rouse Mr Walker His daughter arrived one day with a keyboard Ms Walker watched on an iPad in the hospital parking lot His fingers crawled up the keyboard and he put them on the keys she said Then he began to play and she sang along You could just see the light switch on Ms Walker said Mr Walker has since returned home He continues to work with physical therapists to rebuild muscles to

vaccine shot will take part in the most ambitious vaccination effort in US history As efforts ramp up heres advice from doctors involved with the vaccine rollout on how to prepare and what to expect Many people will register for a timed appointment aimed at keeping wait times and the potential for crowds to a minimumalthough the patchwork rollout so far has also meant many waiting in long lines After filling out consent forms and receiving the shot youll be monitored for adverse reactions for 15 or 30 minutes depending on your allergy history In the case of a timed appointment the entire process should take around an hour says Julie Boom cochair of the Covid19 Vaccine Task Force at Texas Childrens Hospital in Houston which is now vaccinating eligible patients that already have records within the hospital system Afterward some people choose to go home and rest In most cases youll simply need your photo ID and proof of your appointment Some places may require additional documents such as employee badges for first responders to show they are eligible Those getting vaccinated generally shouldnt be asked to pay so do ask questions if payment is requested For now the two vaccines available in the US are found to be similarly safe and effective says Wafaa ElSadr professor of epidemiology and medicine at Columbia University in New York Eventually choosing one vaccine over the other may come down to scheduling conflicts she says The second dose of the Pfizer vaccine is offered 21 days later while Moderna is offered 28 days later The only thing I would consider is convenience says Dr ElSadr No food precautions are required Staying well hydrated prior to the vaccine is encouraged for people who tend to feel lightheaded with vaccines or blood draws says Gregory Huhn vaccination coordinator for Cook County Health a hospital system in Chicago Even if you are worried about side effects the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention doesnt recommend taking feverreducing drugs known as antipyretics before a vaccine shot However antipyretics such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen can be used following vaccination to treat any fever or local discomfort the CDC says In any public setting theres a possibility of being exposed to the virus The vaccine dose received that day wont offer additional protection Dr Huhn says However vaccinesite organizers are aware of the risks and take precautions throughout the process which includes floor decals and furniture spaced at least six feet apart along with strict masking and capacity limits he says People are asked to stay at the site to be monitored for adverse effects including allergic reactions though these are rare Those experiencing any postvaccine sensations can call over a medical professional to address concerns The monitoring occurs within the line of sight of our nurses Dr Huhn says In some cases Dr Boom notes feelings of faintness can relate to nervousness over getting the shot rather than side effects relating directly to the vaccine While those vaccinated are asked to stay between 15 and 30 minutes it is possible to have an allergic reaction or worrying side effects after returning home Dr Huhn notes Anaphylaxis can occur hours after exposure he says If that happens immediately seek medical help Adults will receive a vaccination card that includes the lot number and name of the administered vaccine along with a reminder to get their second dose Those going for their second dose will need to bring this card with them Your vaccination data is also recorded by the vaccine provider and stored electronically Dr Boom says Later you may need your vaccine document for work or travel purposes While many experience no side effects at all some younger people with more robust immune systems often have a stronger immune response to the vaccine which can take the form of side effects including fatigue muscle aches and soreness at the injection site In previous research those over age 55 had less reactogenicity because their immune systems arent as vigorous as those of younger individuals Dr Huhn says Those who have previously had Covid may also have a stronger immune response he adds Doctors say there is likely some protection from the first shot but as the majority of participants in the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine trials received two doses there isnt yet enough data to say definitively how much protection and how long it lasts The second dose enables the immune system to provide longlasting protection Doctors strongly advise getting both shots in the recommended time frame It takes time for your body to build protection after any vaccination the CDC says and the vaccines that require two shots may not protect you until a week or two after your second shot The protective effect begins to be observed from two weeks after the second vaccine injection Dr ElSadr says She notes that the minimum followup for vaccine study participants was eight weeks and that information will evolve over time on the duration of protection Precautions including maskwearing and staying away from others are important even after youve been fully vaccinated as the vaccines arent 100 effective Dr ElSadr says Latestage trials showed Pfizer has 95 effectiveness while Moderna has 941 Additionally it is possible that even those who have been vaccinated can carry the virus without showing symptoms and pass it onto others Research on this is still under way  By submitting your response to this questionnaire you consent to Dow Jones processing your special

Disease Control and Prevention Meanwhile it had among the highest rates in the US for positive coronavirus tests over the past month at 291 based on data compiled by Johns Hopkins University Several factors are at play health officials and specialists say Alabamas publichealth system has been depleted by years of poor funding leaving some counties with thinly staffed health departments or no department at all Administrative and technological problems including inadequate appointment programs and outdated software have hobbled the effort Alabamas telephone hotline for vaccine appointments initially fell short with insufficient lines to handle demand said nnnnnnnnnn      n      Dr Karen Landersnnnn       a district medical officer for the Alabama Department of Public Health An appointment website went live only last week Last month a reservation glitch resulted in people showing up for scheduled appointments at a vaccination event in the Birmingham area only to find it was mistakenly listed and no one was there A large portion of Alabamas population lives in rural areas with limited health services Since 2009 seven rural hospitals have shut down in the state  part of a broader wave of closures driven by factors including population loss and poverty among patient populations according to the Cecil G Sheps Center for Health Services at the University of North Carolina Alabamas challenges are indicative of the general erosion of the rural healthcare infrastructure across the country said nnnnnnnnnn      n      Mark Holmesnnnn       director of the center VIEW Graphic Scott Harrisnnnn       the state health officer said technical problems made it difficult for Alabama to gather data from providers As a result he said the number of doses the state actually was administering was routinely higher than the figures published by the CDC Dr Harris said an unpredictable vaccine supply from the federal government early on made planning a challenge but the Biden administration is now assuring allotments will remain stable and providing new projections three weeks ahead of time The state is trying to speed up vaccine administration by reallocating some doses from providers that arent using them quickly and by holding massinoculation events in various cities this week We need people to understand theres not enough to go around Dr Harris said at a recent news conference Were going to do our best to get it out as quickly as we can Virginia Brasher has spent hours at a time trying to get a vaccine appointment for her husband who is a teacher and became eligible on Monday She said she dialed the state hotline about 200 times one day until she got through only to be referred to a county health office She spent another day calling pharmacies and medical offices on a state provider list but some said they had no doses and didnt know why they were on the list Its just kind of a mess said Ms Brasher 37 years old and a resident of Morris near Birmingham She finally secured an appointment for her husband on Saturday Ive got my fingers crossed she said Among the states 66 county health departments which provide clinical and other services 36 have either one nurse or none said nnnnnnnnnn      n      Dr William Currynnnn       who specializes in rural health care at the University of Alabama at Birmingham Staffing at county health departments in 2019 was 65 of the 2010 level said nnnnnnnnnn      n      Jim Carnesnnnn       policy director at Alabama Arise a nonprofit focused on poverty issues The reductions resulted from budget cuts in the wake of the 200809 financial crisis and state lawmakers pursuit of lean government he said We have really tied our own hands in Alabama by undercutting the publichealth infrastructure in our budgets Mr Carnes said Since the pandemic began Alabama has tried to increase staffing by hiring contract workers and it has redirected publichealth workers from areas like food safety and rabies control to coronavirus efforts Dr Landers said With the publichealth system strained the state has relied on hospitals and other institutions At Huntsville Hospital a contingent of 70 to 75 staffers works on the inoculation effort said Chief Executive nnnnnnnnnn      n      David Spillersnnnn       The facility set up a new vaccination site that is increasing the number of doses administered to about 1000 a day and it deploys a mobile medical unit to deliver shots to underserved areas Were a hospital not a health department but we have taken the role of a health department Mr Spillers said Alabamas population is 41 rural among the highest proportions in the US according to US Census data And the state has large populations of conservatives Black people and other groups that polling shows are hesitant about getting vaccinated How has the vaccine rollout been going near you Join the conversation below Southeast of Birmingham rural Coosa County has no hospital and its health department closed in 2016 as a result of budget cuts said nnnnnnnnnn      n      Sheldon Hutchersonnnnn       the countys emergency management director With no local health official to turn to he called contacts and finally reached someone at the state health department which organized two vaccination events in the county in January In rural Macon County home to Tuskegee officials have grappled with vaccine hesitancy among Black people who make up 83 of its population Memories linger of the notorious Tuskegee Syphilis Study of Black men that ended in 1972 and was deemed unethical by a federal panel The county is working with a bioethics center at Tuskegee University to conduct focus groups with residents and combat misinformation Residents have expressed fears of getting injected

Journal","https://www.wsj.com","www.wsj.com","c https//wwwwsjcom/articles/willwebereadyforthenextpandemic11613145677 Fast forward to 2023 The Covid19 pandemic is largely behind us Most of the world has been vaccinated though we have to tamp down occasional flareups and people sometimes still wear masks While we mourn the millions who died we have entered a postpandemic world in which most things are more or less as they were before Covid19 Travel and trade are unrestricted everything from dinner parties and big weddings to stadium concerts and megachurch services are being held again and economies are booming to keep pace with pentup demand Then just as suddenly as Covid19 emerged disease detectives discover a fresh cluster of a new pneumonialike illness Testing quickly confirms that it isnt a variant of Covid19 but a new influenza virus that jumpedsomehow somewherefrom birds to humans The new virus is as infectious as the one that caused Covid19 but four times as deadly And unlike Covid19 but like the devastating 1918 influenza pandemic the new virus is particularly deadly to young adultsand in this case also to children A horrifying influenza pandemic isnt the only nightmare scenario that could be worse than Covid19 Think of the hundreds of thousands of cases of tickborne Lyme disease in the US each year In other parts of the world some ticks spread Ebolalike illnesses and if these infections spread to the US tickbites could also lead to a disease with the terrifying lethality of Ebola Or a highly drugresistant bacterium could spread rapidly Or a laboratory could develop an untreatable vaccinedefying strain of a virus or bacterium andintentionally or by accidentrelease it into the world The world wasnt ready for Covid19 Will we be ready for the next inevitable pandemic To prepare we must start by understanding that the lessons from battling Covid19 arent just about Covid19 We will fail if we learn nothing more than how to fight the last war better Now is the time to get ready and to realize that the costs of preparedness will be dwarfed by the price of disaster Here are six urgent steps the world must take to become far more pandemicproof We will have to respond rapidly to any potentially major new health threat I suggest a goal of 717 Every country should be able to identify any new suspected outbreak within seven days of emergence start to investigate the event within one day and report it then and mount an effective responsedefined by clear specific benchmarks for different pathogenswithin seven days These goals will help governments focus attention and resources Part of the reluctance to fund health preparedness has been a lack of simple measurements of progress One reason for the broad bipartisan support for the global battles against HIV and malaria has been the appeal to American politicians and voters alike of clear metrics the numbers of people treated bednets distributed lives saved For HIV the goal has been what the UN calls 909090ensuring that 90 of people infected with HIV know their status getting sustained treatment to 90 of those diagnosed and suppressing the viral load of 90 of the people on treatment This strategy has turned concrete lifesaving outcomes into targets for global action Meeting the 717 goal or something like it is essential to a safer planet but it wont be easy It will require several other steps The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC have learned a crucial lesson over the past two decades The best emergency responses use everyday systems that are robust enough to scale up in an emergency Yet efforts to strengthen such systems are often unfocused Enhancing countries capacities will require substantial resources robust technical assistance and an insistence on accountability As noted in a recent study by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation a globalhealth research group at the University of Washington School of Medicine annual funding for global health in 2019 was an estimated 41 billion less than 20 of which came from the US Of that total the group estimated that less than 1 was for pandemic preparednesssome 374 million Credible estimates of the amount needed to boost preparedness beyond current investments in low and middleincome countries start at 5 to 10 billion a year for the next two or three years continuing for at least a decade This would come in addition to funding for better research primary healthcare and other steps essential for progress This is serious money but it is dwarfed by the costs of an outofcontrol pandemic as we have all painfully learned Many countries will need technical assistance which can be provided in part by the World Health Organization and its networks as well as by the US CDC Such efforts could be complemented by additional regional publichealth organizations For instance during the Covid19 crisis the newly created Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention a publichealth agency of the African Union officially launched in 2017 has supported stronger diseasetracking and response systems as well as a rapid expansion of sorely needed laboratory services on the continent The European Union announced late last year a 20fold increase in funding for the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control founded in 2004 and discussions are under way about creating similar regional diseasecontrol centers in Southeast Asia and the Middle East Stronger bilateral programs from the US the UK and other wealthy countries can also help China would be likely to follow suit and increase its own global publichealth engagement Structured well this could be an area for USChinese collaboration As recent studies in the Lancet and other medical journals have noted the Covid19 pandemic has underscored the central importance of primary care New infectious diseases will be able to spread widely until patients can afford to go to health centers as soon as they feel ill clinicians are trained to diagnose and report patients with unusual conditions and health centers can provide accessible treatments and vaccinations Most countries havent invested remotely enough in primary careincluding the US which performs abysmally on core measures of primarycare quality This is a major reason for the rocky US rollout of Covid19 vaccinations But even with more money and better technical assistance the world wont be able to meet the 717 goal unless it is organized for success As the lead UN agency for global public health the WHO remains the indispensable anchor of such efforts The organization has obvious limitations It has often been underfunded underpowered and reluctant to criticize governments But it performs several indispensable roles providing evidencebased publichealth guidance facilitating international collaboration openly tracking data and helping countries to strengthen their publichealth efforts The WHO needs real reforms to meet its mission It must be much better insulated from political and geographic considerations in the hiring and promotion of staff as well as in its assessments of countries and recommendations to them A stronger WHO could provide robust technical support to governments worldwide especially through its proposed Global Strategic Preparedness Network As the world faces 21stcentury pandemics its international publichealth structures still come largely from postWorld War II agreements with newer entities often grafted awkwardly onto them The WHO was central to global health during the Cold War era with a prominent role for the US CDC too but new entitiesincluding new national and regional CDCs based on the US modelhave reshaped the landscape of global health The two largest new publichealth groupsthe Global Fund to Fight AIDS Tuberculosis and Malaria and Gavi the Vaccine Alliancehave a combined budget that is about twice that of the WHO Some new philanthropies particularly the Bill  Melinda Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust are also large and influential The Global Fund is a major financier of programs to combat the three diseases in its title while Gavi helps to negotiate and finance vaccines for lowerincome countries Both are international organizations that arent part of the UN and arent under WHO control They receive their substantial resources from country governments which have steadily increased their investments in the Global Fund and Gavi because of their efficiency accountability and impressive results But both entities were created without strong technical components in large part to avoid alienating the WHO and the WHO hasnt been able to provide sufficient specialized expertise to ensure that Global Fund and Gavi programs reach their potential These new entities have brought far more resources energy and accountability into global health but they havent substantially strengthened laboratory capacity disease monitoring primary care and other capacities essential to beating Covid19 and future pandemics By working together to strengthen earlywarning systems share data improve rapidresponse capacities and strengthen healthprotection systems worldwide we can save millions of lives and trillions of dollars This will cost billions a year spent by countries large and small but that pales in comparison to the International Monetary Funds October 2020 estimate that Covid19 has cost the world some 20 trillion The next pandemic could be even deadlierand costlier The world needs new financial mechanisms for readiness that can administer funds efficiently offering accountability and boosting confidence for government investments The World Bank the African Development Bank the Asian Development Bank and other entities can play important roles Most important the Global Fund could both generate and disburse funds for national preparedness It could offer not just money but specific benchmarks toward the 717 goal and a new pandemicspecific structure for ownership and oversight in recipient countries involving ministries of finance health agriculture and more as well as the private sector and civilsociety groups An eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind as the old saying goes Today failures of global cooperation worsen the spread of infectious diseases by leaving the world blind to emerging threats But by working togetherby sharing data knowledge and resourceswe can increase our shared safety and security One neglected issue is improving laboratory safety Some lab errors are inevitable but we have insufficient global standardsand no global oversightto reduce the risk of unintentional release of deadly pathogens as may have occurred with influenza from an accidental laboratory release in the former Soviet Union in the late 1970s and is documented to have occurred with smallpox in the UK in 1978 and with SARS in China in 2004 Release of a biological agent could be as deadly as a nuclear war and we need similarly vigorous systems of standards and inspections to reduce that horrifying risk Advances in biological science have made it increasingly easy to create dangerous pathogens A global compact to limit the number of laboratories personnel and experiments and to more safely manage them could substantially reduce the risk Even reaching this modest goal would be difficult It would be expensive require global agreement face resistance by researchers demand inspections and still fail to eliminate the risk of bad actors But we urgently need it nonetheless We must also reduce the risk of diseases spreading from animal populations to humanity Most dangerous new pathogens emerge from human contact with animals often because of our encroachment into traditional habitats A global enforceable compact as proposed by Vanda FelbabBrown of the Brookings Institution and others would help to end the commercial sale of wild animals for food In parts of Africa and Asia where bush meat is important to nutrition we will also need economic measures that make it easier to substitute other locally available sources of protein and much stronger programs are needed to reduce the risk of influenza spreading from birds and swine to people Whats the biggest lesson you think public officials should draw from the pandemic Join the conversation below Finally the world must increase its manufacturing capacity for diagnostics treatments and vaccines Pathogens spread so we cannot leave millions without access to the topquality diagnosis treatment and vaccines we want for ourselves The Rand Corp has warned of the dangers of vaccine nationalism in which countries push to get first access to a supply of vaccines potentially hoarding key components for vaccine production Such shortsighted behavior is both ethically indefensible and politically inevitable One solution would be to increase manufacturing by countries with relatively small populations which would be able to vaccinate their own populations without having much impact on the overall supply The world could also work to boost manufacturing capacity through companies that accept global financing in exchange for their agreement to produce reasonably priced products that meet stringent standards and to distribute them in underserved regions Exciting new technologies such as mRNAwhich made possible the first two Covid19 vaccines licensed in the USraise the promise of platforms that can be rapidly repurposed to tackle new threats Globally supported mRNA production facilities could help end the current pandemic and potentially produce lifesaving vaccines and medicines that would create a sustainable business model with sales to public and private purchasers between pandemics But more than all this we need a new global attitude We must act now 2021 is the nowornever moment to improve global resilience in facing future pandemics We cant know the character or the timing of the threats ahead but they are inevitable There is no time to lose in making preparations Publichealth decisions are unavoidably political Failing to act in the face of Covid19s proof that the world is dangerously vulnerable would also be a decision This year when the urgency of such work is so clear we must make significant investments to protect and expand global healthor we and

remotely from another country If so where would you relocate and why Join the conversation below Laurie Beijens family had long wanted to move from San Francisco to Spain for a year Her husband had been able to do it twice as a child thanks to the sabbaticals his professor father took and he wanted his kids to have a similar formative experience We never figured out how we could make it work said Ms Beijen 46 who manages rental properties Last fall with Ms Beijen and her husband both working remotely and their kids 11 and 9 in school two days a week an ambitious plan emerged We were like we can either sit here and have Groundhog Day every day like weve been doing for the past several months Ms Beijen said or we can do something with this time and really kind of make it matter It took a few months to assemble their visa paperwork like the biggest term paper Ive ever done she said They submitted it the day before Thanksgiving received approval in January and departed a few days later Vacation Homes Are Helping Families Separate During Coronavirus Some families are using their second homes to protect vulnerable parents or selfisolate after college or a trip abroad SecondHome Buyers Are Flocking to Wales Some Locals Arent Happy About It The country is becoming more popular with English buyers drawn to its beauty and value The Barbados RealEstate Market Is Seeing Signs of Life Thanks to Some Eager New Residents Property agents say theyre already seeing action in the rental market and longterm tourism industry Now theyre living in a small town outside of Valencia in southeastern Spain The modernized farmhouse the family rented is surrounded by orange and avocado trees on weekends they visit nearby beaches and castles The kids attend a private British school nearbyin person five days a week So far so good Ms Beijen said The Department of State estimates that some 9 million US citizens live outside of the country When Covid19 closed borders and triggered restrictions around the world thousands of them returned homeeven diplomats as some 6000 were evacuated with their families But other Americans are bucking the trend leaving the US to live overseas for anywhere from a few months to indefinitely A number of hotels and resorts have been capitalizing on the appeal of extended stays offering discounts and upgrades for bookings that are over 14 days or a month Luxury travel company Embark Beyond launched an Embark Longer program which offers discounts and amenities such as unlimited laundry service for resort and villa stays upward of a month We have clients staying several months in places like St Barts and even Ireland said Jack Ezon founder of Embark Beyond And several countries are offering special streamlined visa programs that allow foreigners to work legally for several months or a year see Stay Awhile below These pandemic expats are motivated by a range of factors Some want to give meaning to these bleak times or take the opportunity that remote work offers to learn to live abroad A chance to give kids a more normal life after months of confinement also plays a role Thats what attracted Sugath Warnakulasuriya a 55yearold consultant who lives with his wife and son in Pasadena Calif where schools have been closed since March We tried to create as normal and magical an experience as we could for our son he said But parks were closed and play dates a nonstarter His wife Angelina Horn Jorgensen is from Denmark She brought their 5yearold son to her homeland last summer and discovered a completely different environment So they decided to stay Life felt a lot more normal Mr Warnakulasuriya said The schools were going to be open People are careful they follow the rules but its not socially crushing Their son attends an international school in central Denmark which was open for inperson learning until December when it closed temporarily because of a spike in Covid cases Before the latest spike the

and her husband Jerry a 61yearold privateequity investor felt confined in their 700squarefoot apartment Last August they moved to Los Cabos Mexico Were able to have a relatively normal life here Ms McRoberts said Residents always wear masks in public and there are sanitizing mats that disinfects the soles of your shoes in building doorways she said We go out for brunch we went whale watching If youre eating out youre basically outside on the beach Long before Covid the McRobertses thought they might like to live even retire abroad Lisbon appealed for its walkability culture affordability and tax advantagestransplants are exempt from local taxes for the first 10 years But as so many people did the couple found 2020 a lesson in adaptability They started applying for Portuguese visas last

Spanish Theyre working remotely and plan to continue when they move on to Lisbon You dont have to be young to be a digital nomad Ms McRoberts said You can do this late in life For Jenny Recotta and Patrick Culver figuring out where they could live was the biggest challenge in leaving Seattle After marrying last summer they quit their jobsshe is a labor and delivery nurse he is in humanitarian responseand started looking for a place they could move to for several months Navigating every countrys restrictions was incredibly difficult Ms Recotta said They finally chose Dominica despite knowing little about the Caribbean island In less than a month they bought plane tickets and organized housing Since arriving in November theyve lived in four vacation rentals the lack of tourists let them book places that would otherwise have busted their budget The couple is currently staying on an 18acre farm surrounded by flowers and fruit trees The view reveals a valley and even a distant slice of ocean Its about as different as it could be from Seattle Mr Culver said Life here isnt perfect but its pretty amazing It can be hard to adjust to a new place make connections overcome language barriers and find community It might be exponentially harder given the restrictions and face coverings of the pandemic Ms Beijen whose family moved to Spain said she misses social interactions the most Weve met people at the school but we cant have play dates Ms Recotta and Mr Culver were initially frustrated by the slow pace and challenging infrastructure in their temporary home When you look at Dominica on a map you think its such a small island it must be easy to get everywhere Mr Culver said The roads are windy theres obstacles that youre trying to navigatethings just take more time A nearly universal pandemic problemthat feeling of missing family memberscan become even more acute when youre overseas Mr Warnakulasuriya wishes he were closer to his mother in Pasadena Then theres the homesickness For her part Julien McRoberts finds the sunny largely seasonless weather in Baja pleasant but sometimes monotonous I do miss New York she said Its hard looking at Instagram and seeing the pretty pictures of snow Its easier to relocate to these countriesfrom a desert kingdom to a tropical islandthanks to pandemicinspired visa programs With international tourism

biggest workplacesafety challenges in its 50year history when the coronavirus struck It didnt meet the moment Instead of thoroughly investigating complaints of unsafe practices at workplaces the federal agency and state OSHA agencies it oversees often took limited steps OSHA records and state health data show leaving workers more vulnerable to workplace outbreaks When Kentucky warehouse employees complained that masks werent being worn at their site when a group representing Illinois packaging workers asked if OSHA would enforce social distancing and when workers at a poultry plant said it wasnt responding to a disease outbreak the federal agency or a state counterpart took little action as infections at the sites increased according to interviews OSHA documents and health department records OSHAs mandate spelled out in a 1970 law is to help ensure safe and healthy working conditions by setting workplace standards and enforcing them But the agencys rules are largely designed to minimize chemicalexposure risks and injuries such as falls and electric shockfor the most part problems that are readily identifiable and correctable It has struggled to address the altogether different hazard of the coronavirus invisible lacking a sure corrective and permeating blurred lines between workplace and the world outside Separate agencies have roles in administering OSHAs mission and they  must be as effective as the federal government Federal OSHA which regulates workplaces in 29 states sets standards for state agencies elsewhere Federal OSHA said when the virus struck that it had rules in place to protect workers Yet some state agencies took an opposite positionthat there were no rules to enforce to address many Covid19 concerns Other state agencies created rules of their own Workers flooded state and federal OSHA agencies with complaints alleging their workplaces werent safe On the federal level OSHAs complianceofficer staff had declined in recent years Managers needed to limit the officers exposure to Covid19 Compounding the challenge early on were shortages of masks and shifting guidance from authorities about who needed to wear them in the face of a poorly understood threat The Wall Street Journal identified more than 1000 worker deaths from Covid19 that circumstances suggest were linked to workplace transmission of the virus but that were never investigated by an OSHA agency as of early February Many hadnt been reported by employers The difficulty of determining when a Covid19 death should be deemed workrelated was one of the challenges facing OSHA during the pandemic It cant be known whether different actions by regulators or others could have prevented any specific worker death from Covid19 A virus in the workplace isnt a hazard easily fixed like a wobbly scaffold But some health and safety experts argue that especially last spring OSHA missed repeated chances to ensure that employers did all they could to minimize risk to essential workers those who must be on site producing goods or delivering services The pandemic has exposed OSHAs great weaknesses said nnnnnnnnnn      n      David Michaelsnnnn       the OSHA director in the Obama administration Workers have never been so threatened by a hazard as they have by the coronavirus A report dated last week by the US Department of Labors Office of the Inspector General said that a lack of OSHA onsite inspections remained a problem during the pandemic and that it was particularly problematic that OSHA hadnt been tracking which inspections were remote and which were onsite With most OSHA inspections done remotely during the pandemic workplace hazards may go unidentified and abated longer leaving employees vulnerable the audit found In a response included in the report OSHA said it would begin tracking its remote inspections and implement other recommendations raised by the audit James Fredericknnnn       the acting head of OSHA said in response to questions the agency is working with the inspector generals office to improve its ability to protect workers from exposure to Covid19 and advocate for those hit hardest by the pandemic It has always made clear the pandemic falls within its scope Eliminating hazards from COVID19 remains a top priority for OSHA the federal agency said in a May 2020 note to staff OSHA took the position last year that it was doing effective virusrisk enforcement pointing to the federal agencys citations of employers after 263 virusrelated inspections resulting in 35 million in fines President Biden has issued an executive order that asks OSHA to consider setting a new emergency standard to address Covid19 a step the federal agency under the previous administration declined to take The 1970 law that created OSHA says employers are responsible for providing employees with a workplace free of recognized hazards OSHAs job is enforcing that obligation To do that federal OSHA has long had a policy of responding to virtually all complaints received whether from workers or their representatives sometimes by inspecting workplaces OSHAs internal manual tells its officers to investigate all fatalities that result from an injury or illness caused by a work hazard to determine the cause and whether there were any violations by the employer Agencies typically do this by inspecting the workplaces to make sure they pose no risk to other workers OSHA agencies received 72 more complaints from February 2020 through January 2021 than in the yearearlier 12 months agency data show That came to nearly 93000 complaints about 57000 of them related to the coronavirus Complaints Inspections Covid related 100 thousand 80 60 40 20 0 2019 2020 Feb 1 2019 to Jan 31 2020Feb 1 2020 to Jan 31 2021 Source Occupational Safety and Health Administration The agencies performed workplace inspections after far fewer complaints than usual 12 versus 32 in the preceding 12 months according to OSHA records They inspected workplaces after less than 6 of the complaints that were related to Covid19 Even complaints unrelated to Covid19 led to inspections less frequently in the latest 12 months than in the preceding period Federal OSHAs staff of compliance officers stood at 944 in January 2020 down from 1106 in 2010An official told Congress last year OSHA was trying to hire more but doing so wasnt easy Mr Frederick said the total now is 894 The agency has long been viewed as a less forceful regulator than some other agencies with limits on fines it can impose and a lengthy review process for new regulations To assess OSHA agencies performance in the pandemic the Journal examined inspection and complaint documents from federal and state OSHAs as well as diseaseoutbreak data from state and local departments of health and data on nursinghome staff deaths from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services or CMS The Journal catalogued thousands of worker deaths scouring local news reports and obituaries and interviewed family members and coworkers of those who died To gauge whether worker deaths that werent reported to OSHA might have been workrelated meriting a report the Journal applied OSHAs guidelines It also checked whether deaths occurred during Covid19 outbreaks as confirmed by local or state health departments at the workplaces For a time last spring OSHA told most employers they didnt need to try to determine whether a worker death from Covid19 was workrelated OSHA agencies typically use government records and media reports to identify unreported worker fatalities but during the pandemic they havent always closely monitored media death reports or data such as nursinghome fatality totals from CMS according to government records By looking at Covid19 figures in five states and nursinghome data from CMS the Journal identified more than 500 Covid19 outbreaks involving some 6000 infections at workplaces where employees had earlier complained to OSHA of unsafe conditions The Journal also found 180 worker deaths from Covid19 that occurred four weeks or more after complaints to OSHA agencies that the agencies didnt investigate beyond corresponding with employers Workplace safety agencies slightly increased their inspection rates for Covid19related complaints after the early pandemic months of March and April but were still below levels of general complaint inspections according to the Journals analysis Federal OSHA didnt make substantial changes to its approach after it laid out its enforcement protocols and priorities in April and revised them in May Some state OSHA agencies began enforcing governors safety requirements for workplaces Several other states issued emergency OSHA standards The Journals numbers are likely to substantially understate workplacerelated employee deaths from Covid19 Probable infection sources have been publicly identified for just a small fraction of what Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data show as 90000 people of working age who have died of the disease Told of the Journals findings in December nnnnnnnnnn      n      Loren Sweattnnnn       then acting head of OSHA said in a statement By pulling isolated alleged incidents out of context from the thousands of inspections conducted by OSHA these criticisms unfairly disparage the work of dedicated OSHA inspectors across the country who have now issued nearly 300 COVID citations and kept hundreds of thousands of workers safe on the job The new acting director Mr Frederick said the agency was working on potential changes in its enforcement efforts to better protect workers and ensure the safety of its compliance officers In an example of OSHA agencies conflicting approaches Utahs state agency responded to many coronavirusrelated complaints by telling complainants the matter was outside its jurisdiction and declining even to inform employers of the concern according to state officials and documents viewed by

rules for it to enforce until November when it created its own emergency administrative rule requiring maskwearing for all employees Its prior norules stance conflicted with federal OSHAs position that there were rules in place to address Covid19 Similarly when an Illinois workeradvocacy group asked OSHA last spring about safety worries at a firm that packages soaps a local director of OSHA replied that although it had received complaints of employers not following CDC guidelines it couldnt enforce these because they werent formal rules The best OSHA could do was send employers an advisory letter the director said in an email to the advocacy group the Chicago Workers Collaborative OSHA later received two complaints from others about the soappackaging plant in Waukegan Ill alleging it ignored social distancing and cleaning guidelines according to documents viewed by the Journal In response to an April complaint the local OSHA director told the employer Visual Pak Cos that OSHA wouldnt conduct an onsite inspection but the company should undertake one on its own Visual Pak in early May informed OSHA it was providing personal protective equipment taking workers temperatures and doing extensive sanitation according to correspondence viewed by the Journal After it provided the names of disinfectants used records of the case show the agency closed the complaint The company didnt mention that two workers 59yearold nnnnnnnnnn      n      Reyna Salgadonnnn       and 40yearold nnnnnnnnnn      n      Javier Escobedonnnn       had just died during a Covid19 outbreak at the workplace according to documents viewed by the Journal and interviews with family members State records show at least 47 workers tested positive during the outbreak according to documents obtained by the Documenting Covid19 project from Brown Institute for Media Innovation a program of Columbia University and Stanford University Visual Pak declined to comment on the outbreak or on why it didnt report the deaths to OSHA nor would it say how many people work at the plant The company described worker safety as its top priority and said its efforts include social distancing and requiring employees to stay home if they feel unwell In Kentucky the state Labor Cabinet which houses Kentuckys Occupational Safety and Health Program received eight complaints by the end of March about nnnnnnnnnnn            United Parcel Servicesnnn       Worldport distribution hub in Louisville Some alleged a lack of sanitizer masks or effective distancing in places including shuttle buses The Kentucky Labor Cabinet didnt take immediate action on the complaints according to information provided by Cabinet officials By midApril two employees who worked at the site had died of Covid19 The spokeswoman said the March complaints werent formal OSHA complaints because they had been filed to the Labor Cabinets KYSafer portal a hotline set up in the pandemic UPS didnt report either death as a workrelated fatality Asked why a spokesman said There is no way to know where someone was actually infected OSHA took note of that problem in April and put out guidance saying that for employers not involved in health care or emergency services the agency wouldnt enforce its normal requirement that companies determine whether the death of a worker was workrelated Instead they needed to make this determination only if there was objective evidence a Covid19 case might be workrelated However new OSHA guidance effective May 26 said all employers should seek to determine whether any employee who died of Covid19 had caught it at work The new guidance said Covid19 cases that arose during an outbreak among employees working together or in close contact with the public should likely be considered workrelated The essential workers in jobs such as warehouse work tend to be lower income and Black and Latino employees are highly represented in their ranks relative to the population as a whole studies by health agencies show One UPS Worldport worker who died in April was nnnnnnnnnn      n      Howard Hopkinsnnnn       55 His sister nnnnnnnnnn      n      Michelle Hopkinsnnnn       and his roommate nnnnnnnnnn      n      Tracey Taylornnnn       said they believed he caught the virus on the job because he had little activity outside of work and he had fretted about a lack of mask wearing at UPS and about crowded shuttle buses At the time UPS let workers forgo masks if they signed waivers The CDC on April 3 had urged everyone to wear masks in public changing a prior recommendation of masks primarily for a smaller group such as healthcare workers and people with symptoms The other UPS workers death appeared in news reports and was confirmed by the states governor during a briefing Mr Hopkinss union issued a statement about a members death without naming Mr Hopkins Kentucky OSH said it investigates worker deaths unreported by employers if it learns of them through the media or referrals from other agencies In this case it didnt look into either UPS death because it wasnt made aware of them said the Labor Cabinet spokeswoman Kentucky OSH officials inspected the UPS Worldport site at the end of April  acting as agents of public health according to the spokeswoman By then there had been about 50 complaints about the workplace to the Kentucky Labor Cabinet records show In midMay Kentucky OSH personnel sent UPS a notice of deficiency about mask wearing and a lack of adequate distancing The agency recommended remedies including requiring that any waiver of mask rules be signed by a health professional UPS told OSHA it would take corrective steps including better distancing on shuttles Kentucky OSH issued no citation although it opened a formal inspection of the work site the next month In August Kentucky OSH received correspondence alleging a lack of proper mask wearing among many people at the UPS site This time the agency didnt notify the employer closing the complaint without followup Kentucky OSH didnt consider this a valid complaint based on state law according to the spokeswoman for the Kentucky Labor Cabinet She said the letter had been forwarded by the US Department of Labor and it addressed union issues in addition to Covid19 matters which the agency believed it had already addressed After the Journal provided information about the Worldport situation and  April deaths Kentucky OSH opened investigations into the fatalities in December Labor Cabinet officials said The agency later cited UPS for failing to protect employees from exposure to Covid19 culminating a prior investigation according to a Labor Cabinet spokesman He said UPS is contesting the case and in the meantime doesnt have to abate the violations The fines total 10450 records show A spokesman for UPS declined to comment on the citations but said the company has worked hard throughout the pandemic to provide for the safety of our employees and to comply with state local and federal Covid19 safety rules as well as to ensure our people understand their personal obligations to the law and each others wellbeing UPS said it rolled out extensive safety measures including requiring mask wearing after Kentuckys governor mandated that in May At the Worldport site 838 members of the 11600strong workforce have been infected since the start of the pandemic last year based on UPSs reports to Louisvilles health department as of early February A company representative said its rates are in line with the communitys The Kentucky Labor Cabinet said that workplacesafety officials have diligently worked to carry out their permanent assigned roles plus new responsibilities as agents of public health using technology as much as possible and safely conducting onsite inspections when warranted Although many OSHA rules were designed to prevent injuries the agency  worked on drafting infectiousdisease rules for healthcare facilities after the H1N1 flu of 2009 It didnt complete the process of formalizing them and they didnt go into effect Besides specific rules OSHA has a broad principle that workplaces must be hazardfree known as the General Duty clause It isnt often invoked After a complaint to the North Carolina Occupational Safety and Health Division on April 6 alleged that a poultry plant was exposing workers to the coronavirus the regulators wrote to the plant operator but said Since the allegation does not fall under an OSHA standard or the General Duty clause a written response to this letter is not required The operator nnnnnnnnnnn            Seaboard Corpsnnn       Butterball LLC did respond with a note saying it was committed to safety and was considering supplying masks and erecting barriers at the 3500worker facility in Mount Olive NC Two more complaints came in to North Carolinas workplace safety agency  One on April 17 said there were 17 Covid19 cases at the plant and there was a concern that the virus is spreading due to employees working very close to each other That same day the Duplin County NC healthservices director told the state health department we are afraid that this plant is going to explode with positive cases within the next 47 days according to an email obtained by the Documenting Covid19 project The North Carolina OSH Division again wrote to Butterball reiterating that the agency had no coronavirusrelated standard to enforce and again asking the company to investigate but not requiring any response The Division said it follows federal OSHAmandated protocols for responding to complaints Federal OSHAs standard letter however says employers should be asked to report the result of their internal investigations It also says that a number of OSHA rules might apply to Covid19 hazards By the end of April Covid19 cases at the poultry plant numbered 80 according to county health documents The county and the company jointly signed an agreement outlining safety measures In May nnnnnnnnnn      n      William Moorennnn       a 29yearold worker at the plant began to feel sick After about a week he died of Covid19 Butterball didnt report his death to North Carolina OSH A  spokeswoman for the company said it didnt believe he had contracted the virus at work Mr Moores family members said he avoided nearly all activities and social contact except traveling to and from the Butterball plant Butterball said its voluntary protocols at the time were consistent with those of other manufacturers evolving CDC and OSHA guidance and available protective equipment It said its measures included companyprovided masks physical barriers on production lines and a workspace reconfigured for distancing It said it has a thorough contacttracing system and is committed to best practices to reduce risks In some instances when OSHA learned of worker deaths that employers hadnt reported it asked the employers to investigate and then accepted their conclusions without doing a fatality investigation which typically entails interviewing family and coworkers and inspecting work sites At a nnnnnnnnnnn            Walmart Incnnn       store in Aurora Colo cashier nnnnnnnnnn      n      Sandra Kunznnnn       72 and security guard nnnnnnnnnn      n      Lupe Aguilarnnnn       69 died within days of each other in April deaths that Walmart didnt report to OSHA Local news publicized their deaths OSHA sent Walmart a letter referencing a death and requested a response but didnt open fatality investigations In a more than 300page reply Walmart told OSHA about its procedures to provide a safe work environment and provided information about Ms Kunz a company spokesman said He said Walmart concluded there was no evidence Ms Kunz had contracted the virus at work Family members said Ms Kunz worried that Walmart hadnt provided masks or guidance on how to handle coughing customers They said she hadnt been informed about any coworkers falling ill Eighteen employees became infected as part of the outbreak Colorados health department said Based on Walmarts response OSHA closed the case with no citation of the employer As for Mr Aguilar Walmart said it didnt report his death because he wasnt an employee but a contract worker The company pointed OSHA to his direct employer Brosnan Risk Consultants which said in a statement it believed neither company was obligated to report his death at that time An OSHA representative said companies are supposed to report any workrelated death of a person they supervise even if the person isnt one of their employees Gia Aguilarnnnn       Mr Aguilars wife said she believes he caught the virus on the job because he wasnt venturing out beyond work Ms Kunz died April 20 Walmart said it began providing masks

https//wwwwsjcom/articles/techtipstohelpscoreacovid19vaccineappointmentatcvsriteaidwalgreensandmore11614594600 Allow me to put this as nicely as possible Rite Aid Id place your Covid19 vaccinebooking website someplace between Horrible and Totally Horrible First I had to navigate through a corn maze of menus to find the actual booking page Then once I miraculously scored an appointment slot by clicking incessantly and entered all the requested information it vanished like a mothball in the snow  The Covid19 vaccine demand heavily outweighs supply said a Rite Aid spokesman When the appointments are made available they are filled quickly An issue on the website which didnt hold your appointment slot when youd start to input your personal information has since been fixed he added Congrats You survived 12 months of pandemic Now fragmented systems shoddy websites and limited vaccine supply stand in the way of you and well the rest of your life Its one of the most important humanvsmachine battles of our time And its made worse by the fact that most humans currently eligible to enter the fray are over 65 and not necessarily glued to a keyboard all day Many sites dont take appointments over the phone either But let me tell you these systems are maddeningly broken no matter your age or technical skill level From national pharmacy chains to hospitals to local supermarkets every Covid19 vaccineappointment website Ive been to has made me feel like Im bad at computers And Ive well you know been reviewing computers for nearly two decades So I set out to beat these Byzantine HungerGamelike systemsand help eligible family and friends in the process much like the generous techsavvy volunteers booking appointments for those in need across the country Along the way I met 34yearold Kris Slevens an IT guy whos booked over 350 appointments for New Jersey seniors He let me into his process which includes setting up a browser tool and adding a couple of browser extensions You dont have to be some hacker or ticket scalper to master these tricks In the subsequent week I booked 11 appointments in five states including Maryland New York and New Jerseysome on the websites of pharmacy companies CVS Rite Aid and Walgreens Have you successfully booked a vaccine appointment online If so share your tips If not what have you found frustrating Join the conversation below Does this mean youll be able to score an appointment as soon as you read this I wish This whole thing is like a Vegas poker game You can increase your odds with some skill and good timing but a lot of it is luck of the draw What this guide isnt for Cutting the line My advice will help book appointments for people whose states have deemed them eligible for Covid19 vaccination Because the US lacks a centralized signup system everything is localized to the state or county level What works in one place might not work in another Sonnnnnnnnnnn            Facebooknn      n        FB 155n      nn      groups have popped up in most states with members who scout the local websites and available appointments Many groups such as the one that Kris moderates help book appointments for inneed seniors If you plan to ask for help from someone you dont know be careful Dont share highly personal information such as passwords or Social Security numbers Having booked for many I know that only basic contact infoname date of birth address phone number and email addressis usually needed Head to Facebook and search for your state and Covid vaccine In the New Jersey New York and Maryland groups I found active members providing minutetominute updates links and even detailed spreadsheets about locations and appointments People have also creatednnnnnnnnnnn            Twitternn      n        TWTR 421n      nn      accounts to provide instant updates on appointment openings To see how other states work I offered to help a Maryland couple in their 70s I followed MDVaxAlerts and set up push notifications on my iPhone Tap the little bell icon on the account page I was alerted to new openings at a CVS location and within five minutes successfully booked two appointments Some people have also built websites that aggregate all the locations in a state such as this one in New York Some other good resources for local information Vaccine Finder run by Boston Childrens Hospital this AARP page with information grouped by state and this site that scans pharmacy sites for availability in different states When youve picked a vaccine location click to its website Find the page that tells you whether appointments are available and the page where you book an appointment Yes sometimes those are different Once you have the links bookmark them I suggest using a laptop or desktop for all of this working on a phone or tablet could slow you down If youd like to get a vaccine through one of the big pharmacy chains here are some specific tips I didnt use Walmart or any of the smaller pharmacy chains but I suggest leaning on your local Facebook groups for information about timing and other site tips In your browser locate your autofill settings This will allow you to store your full name email address home address and phone number in the browser When it comes time to fill in all this the browser will drop it inno time wasted typing or copying and pasting Any way that you can get a millisecond faster than the other person is crucial Kris told me especially when you can have 50000 people vying for one cancellation spot In Chrome go to Settings  Autofill In Microsoft Edge Settings  Personal Information then click the edit button In Safari Preferences  AutoFill  AutoFill web forms  Using information from my contacts Now the hard part Staying uptodate on these sites and available appointments Appointments can disappear minutes after theyre released so in addition to the Twitter and Facebook resources Ive used two tools to try to catch them The first is a browser extension called Page Refresh It will refresh the page youre on every few seconds or minutes without you clicking anything I keep this open on my second monitor Its available for Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge and similar extensions are available for other browsers The Page Refresh developer says the extension doesnt collect any user data One important tip If you see an open appointment stop the refresher ASAP If it refreshes while youre inputting information you could lose your place That solution requires you to keep your eyes on the page A tool called Visualping can do the watching for you You tell the services website or browser extension what website to monitor then you highlight the part of the site that you expect to changein this case something that reads no appointments or appointments booked If it changes you get a computer notification or an email alert For sites such as Walgreens and CVS that require your ZIP Code to check for open appointments you can set that up with Visualpings advanced tools as well The free version of Visualping lets you watch two websites but it only scans once a day That isnt going to cut it I tried the 58amonth version which scans every five minutes and caught an email that led me to a successful booking on a hospitals website The free browser extension is more economical It allows you to set the cadence to a minute but youll have to be at the computer to receive the notificationno email alerts Visualping created this tutorial and list of Covid19 vaccine sites to monitor And thenyou wait When that appointment pops up breathe It gets intense According to my Apple Watch my heart rate has risen five to 10 beats a minute when Im booking Move as fast as you can but not so fast that you dont read the messages and the prompts None of the sites are as slick as Ticketmaster with that helpful booking timer Generally you can skip adding insurance info If its needed you can show it at the appointment And if you have the option to choose from a variety of days and times dont choose the first slots Go for something in the middle where demand isnt as intense Most people try to book the first available appointment Kris said Whatever happens please just remember It isnt you its the Covid19 vaccinebooking website Youre smart youre capable and youre damn good at computers For more WSJ Technology analysis reviews advice and

reopen within his first 100 days in office The CDC also has urged schools to safely reopen as soon as possible with mitigation measures in place Studies so far suggest that schools arent a hotbed for Covid19 spread when safety measures such as masking are strictly followed Yet school reopenings have proceeded haltingly partly due to concerns raised by some teachers and parents Funds to implement

definitely be helpful in keeping and maintaining schools open Mr Domenech said Despite testings potential benefits only a handful of school districts have implemented regular Covid19 testing programs for students and staff Part of the problem Mr Domenech said is a hefty price tag that systems face while encountering additional costs for other pandemic measures The 10 billion funding would help

the nations largest teachers unions something that most public school systems dont have Covid19 screening can be logistically complex sometimes requiring schools to secure waivers and deploy and train additional staff and guidance on how to follow through on positive results or when to seek confirmatory testing The funding can be used to establish diagnostic testing for students and staff with symptoms or those who have been exposed in addition to setting up broader screening programs to regularly test students and staff Carole Johnson the White House Testing Coordinator said at a media briefing We hope more schools will reopen across the country and more kids will be back in the classroom soon Ms Johnson added We know that testing works We know that it works to identify cases and slow the spread of Covid Tulsa Public Schools in Oklahoma has been randomly testing staff and older students through an optional program to find asymptomatic cases The district was able to start the testing program through a partnership with the Tulsa Health Department and a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation The testing program has added another layer of safety for schools as more students returned to the classroom this year Superintendent Deborah Gist said It is unclear what the impact of the Biden administrations effort to expand or begin Covid19 testing programs in schools would be

we will have a much larger number of tests being done each week she said The CDC also is releasing updated testing guidance today that includes recommendations for screening people who dont show Covid19 symptoms but may be contagious a key source of the diseases spread Only in selected places have we capitalized on the benefits of how testing can be used as a screening intervention with frequent tests to identify asymptomatic disease and prevent clusters before they start CDC Directornnnnnnnnnn      n      Rochelle Walenskynnnn      said at the briefing Get an earlymorning briefing about the coronavirus each weekday and a weekly Health newsletter when the crisis abates Teachers are now eligible to be vaccinated in most states and Mr Biden has asked states to make all adults eligible by May Adolescents aged 12 and above likely wont be able to get vaccinated until the fall however and the timeline for younger children stretches into early 2022 Most children have mild symptoms or no symptoms at all when infected with Covid19 and their outcomes tend to be significantly less severe than those of adults Still children can get severely ill and on rare occasions die due to an infection and can also transmit the virus to people at greater risk In its school reopening guidance the CDC currently recommends that schools should offer referrals to diagnostic testing for students and staff who are experiencing symptoms Schools might elect to offer screening but it is not a prerequisite for reopening according to the guidance An additional 225 billion will be allocated

Texas Iowa and Mississippi were among the first states to fully reopen businesses this year ending shutdown orders intended to curb the spread of Covid19 But research suggests the dormant economies wont immediately blossomunless consumers also lose their fear of the coronavirus So far about 40 million Americans or 12 of the population have been fully vaccinated against Covid19 according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention More than 73 million or about 22 have received at least one shot The state of the pandemic not any orders the government imposes about the pandemic is what drives people saidnnnnnnnnnn      n      Chad Syversonnnnn      an economist at the University of Chicago who has studied the phenomenon If the pandemic improves people will go out at a higher rate The orders themselves are icing on cake To measure the economic impact of governmentimposed lockdowns versus the effect of voluntary distancing Dr Syverson and his colleaguennnnnnnnnn      n      Austan Goolsbeennnn      used cellphone data to track customer visits to 225 million businesses in commuter zones across the US last year from January through May Examining commuter zones allowed the researchers to compare consumer behavior in neighboring jurisdictions with the same exposure to Covid19 but different shelterinplace policies If shutdowns were responsible for last years economic collapse jurisdictions that remained open should have fared better than neighboring areas that shut down Instead the researchers found a 60 decrease in consumer traffic on average with only 10 attributable to shelterinplace ordersmeaning that all businesses within the same commuting zone lost traffic but the decline was 10 greater in areas that locked down In addition places that ended shutdown orders saw an equally modest recovery afterwardwhat Dr Syverson described as a mirror image of the decline attributed to the closures We repeated that kind of analysis thousands of times across all sorts of counties businesses and metro areas Dr Syverson said What all these results have shown is the primary driver of business activity is how comfortable or uncomfortable people feel going out to businesses given whats going on with the pandemic The findings were published in the peerreviewed Journal of Public Economics in January When the researchers followed up later using 2020 data from May 18 through Aug 16 and from Oct 5 through Jan 3 the results were nearly identical Its important to note the researchers assumed the number of consumer visits corresponded to the amount of economic activity which wouldnt detect whether people shopped half as often but spent twice as much However a separate study by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago explicitly tracked revenue and spending as well as mobility and found something similar That study linked countylevel stayathome orders to cellphone records and consumer spending in the US from March 1 to April 17 of last year What is your comfort level with going to various businesses and how has that changed over the course of the pandemic Join the conversation below Our results are broadly consistent with and complementary to the Goolsbee and Syverson paper saidnnnnnnnnnn      n      Diane Alexandernnnn      a coauthor of the Chicago Fed study We find similar results to what they find when we look at a different but related data set of cellphone activity They also found that mobility measures didnt fully capture the drop in spending caused by lockdown restrictions Shutdowns were responsible for 16 of the drop in visits to nonessential businesses the study found but 24 of the drop in restaurant revenue and 45 of the drop in nonrestaurant smallbusiness revenue The researchers also tested whether responses to stayathome orders varied by political affiliation and found that the effect was nearly identical across different kinds of counties  An early narrative was that stayathome orders would be ineffective in areas that supported former President Trump Dr Alexander said However we find very similar effects in areas which voted Democratic and Republican in the 2016 election That result might seem surprising but according to an election postmortem prepared by the Republican strategistnnnnnnnnnn      n      Anthony Fabrizionnnn      after last years presidential race a majority of voters in 10 battleground states prioritized stopping the spread of coronavirus over reopening the economy The analysiswhich was obtained by Politicofound that 57 of voters in five states Mr Trump won in 2016 and 2020 and 60 of voters in five states that supported him only in 2016 favored limiting Covid19 over reopening the economy Still researchers at the Chicago Fed and the University of Chicago didnt discount the value of stayathome orders as a publichealth response Lifting them prematurely might increase transmissions of the coronavirus without causing the economy to spring to life Write to Jo

into command of the entire advertising economy According to a provisional analysis by ad agency GroupM the three tech titans for the first time collected the majority of all ad spending in the US last year Beneath the shift are changes driven by the pandemic more time spent on computer screens more ecommerce a jump in newbusiness formation and a steady improvement in tech giants ability to demonstrate a return on ad investment Success breeds success for what some call the triopoly The increase in shopping and spending on Google Facebook and Amazons platforms is adding to their already voluminous data on users giving them even more appeal for advertisers that look to target their messages These companies that are datasciencedriven get stronger and faster with a tailwind of usageand Covid was a hurricane said adindustry veterannnnnnnnnnn      n      Tim Armstrongnnnn      a former Google executive and AOL chief executive who now leads Flowcode a directtoconsumer platform company Many of the pandemicdriven changes likely are here to stay say advertisers and ad forecasters Still when the pandemic winds down its far from certain the tech giants will continue to increase their market share gains at this rate With the vaccine rollout and easing of lockdowns consumers could spend less time and money online and marketers could diversify their spending The growth in online advertising last year came as every other kind of ad spending shrank with doubledigit declines in television newspapers and billboardsaccording to GroupMAnd those online gains flowed heavily to the tech giants rather than to digital media sites and publishers that sell online ads The triopoly increased their share of the US digitalad market from 80 in 2019 to a range approaching 90 in 2020 GroupM estimates Its a surge that comes as the three face scrutiny and litigation from various agencies at home and abroad over their dominance Google in announcing plans to tweak its tools that help publishers and advertisers buy and sell ads is moving away from targeting ads based on individuals browsing activity across the web But that shift might wind up further strengthening Googles grip on the onlinead industry some experts and rivals say because it could boost the value of the data flowing through Google properties such as Search and YouTube Amazon this week said it will begin streaming Thursday Night Football by 2023 giving the company a highprofile franchise to take in ad dollars normally spent on TV broadcasters The three giants arent collecting just the money spent to advertise in the media but also some of the marketing dollars earmarked for coupons catalogs and instore promotions Newbusiness applications in the US which slowly climbed from 200000 a month to 300000 over a decade shot up north of 500000 in July and averaged more than 400000 a month for the second half of 2020 according to the US Census data This proved a boon for the biggest tech platforms which provide the kind of advertising that is often all a startup can afford Facebook says it had more than 10 million active advertisers in the third quarter up from 8 million in January Meanwhile many businesses of all sizes pivoted to ecommerce sellingand turned to digital ads to support that effort Before the pandemic a little more than 10 of retail purchases in the UStook place online That jumped to 16 in last years second quarter when lockdowns peaked according to Census data Though the rate tapered a bit as the year wore on the trend strongly benefits the tech behemoths The pandemic zapped us two years into the future on the ecommerce side saidnnnnnnnnnn      n      Nicole Perrinnnnn      principal analyst at research firm eMarketer Mondelez the Chicagobased maker of Oreo Ritz

neither would be held Mondelez redeployed the money to digital advertising It doubled down on Google ads to capitalize on interest in online recipes among those homebound It used Facebookowned Instagram to host a Pictionarylike game in which an artist made images out of the cream in the middle of an Oreo cookie For the first time Mondelez spent more on digital ads than on TV commercials last year Google and Facebook were the biggest beneficiaries This year digital advertising is projected to account for more than half the roughly 11 billion Mondelez spends on media worldwide It was only about 30 as recently as 2017 TVs share of the companys ad spending continues to decline When Mondelez invests in digital advertising it gets a 25 better return than with TV ads the company says

infection becomes such that each infected person transmits the disease to an average of less than one new case The virus finding inadequate numbers of susceptible people to infect then starts to die out The threshold for herd immunity depends on the contagiousness of a given disease For Covid19 the best estimates suggest that at least 80 of people would need to be immune As of this writing 130 million doses of vaccine have been given in the US leaving 464 million Americans fully immunized and 33 million partially immunized as they await a second dose In addition there have been about 30 million reported cases of Covid Epidemiologists at the CDC and NIH estimate that perhaps an equal number of cases some 30 million have gone unreported How do you think the US should fight the pandemic moving forward Join the conversation below Leaving aside the question of how much these two populations overlap and the extent and durability of protection provided by previous infection this amounts to about 140 million Americans in a population of 330 million with at least some immunity That is just under 43 of the populationvery far from the 80 needed for herd immunity Worse such math misses a crucial point The virus is changing so rapidly that immunity to the Covid strain of yesterday may not protect against todays or tomorrows strainWe now face the challenge of new variants that may elude immunity created by natural infection and possibly by vaccines as well More than 200 people have already been infected with a new variant named Cluster 5 emerging from farmed minks in Denmark Covid19 has also been reported in more than a dozen other species including great apes tigers lions and snow leopards in zoos monkeys cats dogs pigs and some deer There is no evidence yet of continual spillover from established animal reservoirs of the virus But epidemiologists fear a worstcase scenario in which new variants continue to pingpong among humans domestic animals and wildlife There is also the issue of vaccination rates Many Americans cannot get vaccinated for medical reasons Others have been left out of vaccination outreach or distrust the medical system Children count as part of the herd but are not yet being vaccinated Each year there will also be new births and inmigration of unvaccinated people But the biggest challenge is the 30 of Americans who in the most recent Pew poll say that they will either definitely not or probably not get vaccinated Worldwide the greatest impediment to reaching herd immunity is not vaccine hesitancy or even the new more contagious variants it is the lack of access to vaccines The global initiative called COVAX was created to procure and deliver vaccines for lowerincome countries but COVAX remains underfunded and will miss even its modest 2021 goal of delivering 2 billion doses It is likely that for at least the next couple of years billions of people worldwide will remain unvaccinated and susceptible As a result new variants of the disease will continue to multiply increasing transmission and pushing further away any hopes of herd immunity  If herd immunity is out of reach does that mean were doomed Not at all But we must immediately begin to supplement the impressive recent rollout of vaccines with a comprehensive rapidresponse system modeled on the surveillance and containment strategy that William Foege former head of the CDC developed to fight smallpox in the early 1970s Smallpox was eradicated from the globe in 1980the first disease to meet this fate Surveillance in the smallpox campaign meant aggressive contact tracing finding every case of smallpox tracing it backward to sources of infection tracing parallel chains of disease transmission and tracing contacts forward to find those who would become at risk for infection In the analog days of the 1970s this meant going house to house to inquire with more than two billion house calls in India alone Today time is of the essence in finding new Covid19 cases The disease travels at exponential speed whether it is traveling between states imported from other countries or spreading as new variants from animal populations Speed to detect is one of the most important metrics in public health Finding the first cases within days when an outbreak still amounts to just a handful of cases is essential When an outbreak goes undetected for weeks it can generate hundreds or tens of thousands of cases and contact tracing and containment become much more difficult Nor is just finding new generic Covid19 cases enough We need to know what variant of the virus is involved Enhanced testing will be critical and should include faster and cheaper molecular and antigen tests serology to detect immunity created by both infection and vaccination and viral sequencing to inform vaccine and drug design We will need to match new variants of Covid19 with the vaccines most effective against them In addition to surveillance and containment two other factors have been proposed to explain why the smallpox campaign worked so well One was the efficacy of the vaccine itself A few pin pricks from a simple bifurcated needle with freezedried vaccine conferred near lifetime immunity for almost everyone The other factor was the relatively long intervalapproximately 12 daysfrom exposure to disease which was enough time to vaccinate identified cases as well as their contacts and even the contacts of their contacts n        The global program to eradicate smallpox in the 1970s took place in a different era against a different virus and used a very different vaccinen         The global program in the 1970s took place in a different era against a different virus and used a very different vaccine In some places it built upon and supplemented mass vaccination In others eradication was accomplished with less than a quarter of the population vaccinated The program that brought Ebola under control by 2016 after a twoyear outbreak adopted some of these strategies as well For both diseases the paramount goal was finding and isolating cases early and giving justintime vaccinations to those most likely to get the disease next The approach recalls what hockey legend Wayne Gretzky once said I skate to where the puck is going not to where it has been Until recently the lack of faster immunizing vaccines was a stumbling block to adopting justintime vaccination for Covid19 But recent news suggests that the vaccines now authorized for use might work Despite the rapid onset of viral infection an average of 6 days after exposure with a range of 214 days Johnson  Johnson has reported success in preventing moderate to severe disease as early as 7 days after the administration of its singledose vaccine In a realworld study in Israel the Pfizer vaccine also prevented severe disease soon after a single dose It is not too late to find isolate and vaccinate those who do not yet have Covid19 but are most likely to get it It is not too late to use justintime vaccination to stop outbreaks in midcourse and prevent the spread of infection How do we find exposed people just in time to vaccinate them The same way that we find people just in time to isolate them We build exposure notification and tracing systems that find contacts and contacts of contacts most at risk of getting the disease Before we had approved vaccines Vietnam Taiwan and Singapore remained Covidfree for several months with only testing tracing and isolation The common feature across the success stories with Covid19 smallpox and Ebola is energetic contact tracing and isolation of those known to be infected and most at risk of infection Contact tracing has been difficult in the US in part because most Americans no longer pick up the phone from unknown callers Adding more sensitive communitybased tracers helps as do new low friction tools to supplement manual tracing One intriguing possibility is to piggyback justintime vaccination onto digital exposure notification systems that tell people when they really their phones have been in close proximity to someone who is infected offering them testing support for isolation and vaccination appointments at the same time they are notified Data from Ireland and the UK suggest that such digital systems find more contacts and find them sooner than other methods Perhaps the most urgent policy priority is to develop a digital rapiddetection system by integrating information from all the sources now available These include routine reports to health authorities from medical providers and laboratories data gathered from contacttracing databases various digital and crowdsourced participatory surveillance apps like Flu Near You Outbreaks Near Me and How We Feel bulletin boards like ProMed news scrubbers like GPHIN novel risk assessment tools like NOVID and statewide exposure notification systems To be an effective tool for health officials at all levels realtime data from multiple systems will need to be aggregated and assessed quickly perhaps with machine learning and presented in an actionable format Forerunners of such systems already exist at the CDC and at WHOs Global Outbreak And Response Network but none to our knowledge integrate exposure notification systems viral sequencing and justintime vaccination So the task ahead is clear We need to complement mass vaccination with a national plan that applies the latest innovations in discovering and diagnosing viral outbreaks We must add justintime vaccinations allocating a portion of our vaccine supply perhaps 10 to 20 for outbreak containment and target each new outbreak with the vaccine shown by genomic testing to be most likely to succeed against it How to achieve these ambitious goals The 19 trillion stimulus bill recently signed into law by President Biden provides vital resources for the effort including 478 billion for testing hiring contact tracers and creating safer settings for isolation There is also 175 billion for surveillance genomic sequencing and effective response based on this data and another 75 billion for vaccination which could eventually include justintime vaccination targeted at new variants Though a clear strategy doesnt yet exist for creating a national immune system many of the key elements are at least now partly in place n        If we think of Covid19 as a wildfireand it surely spreads like onewe have failed to extinguish itn         But more needs to be done The states should work together to establish a national outbreak alert and response network connecting data scientists public health experts and technologists and each state needs to establish a core group of first responders to complement the CDCs state epidemiologiststrained local specialists ready to deploy to current and future outbreaks If we think of Covid19 as a wildfireand it surely spreads like onewe have failed to extinguish it We still have fires burning all over the country At any point with a shift of the wind think variants less masking relaxed physical distancing the fires will ignite again burn bigger and spread further We need the epidemiological equivalent of the hotshot crews that the forest service deploys to the hottest part of the fires it fights Americans should not expect some kind of all clear signal on Covid19 in the months ahead But if we have substantial numbers of vaccinated Americans robust rapid detection and successful outbreak containment we can accelerate the journey to normalish Every year up to five novel viral pathogens like Zika swine flu or West Nile spill over from animals to humans We have been unlucky with Covid19 but perhaps it will focus our attention on how lucky we have been that the genomic roulette wheel has not given us more lethal bird flus or other coronavirus pandemics A robust national immune system will help us to control Covid19 and leave us better prepared for the

passports aim to let businesses reopen safely but privacy advocates and businesses warn that they may be invasive and onerous The UK government said this week that trials for a Covid19 certificate system would start this month and continue through May With some exemptions people will be required to show proof that they have a recent negative virus test have been vaccinated or are immune after recovering from Covid19 to enter certain events at nightclubs and sports arenas including the soccer FA Cup final Britains National Health Service is developing digital and nondigital ways for individuals to show proof of their virus status with security and privacy at the core of this approach according to a government document published on Monday as the UK prepared to start relaxing its lockdown restrictions Up to 20000 people could be admitted into Londons Wembley Stadium for the May 15 FA Cup game the document said Cybersecurity news analysis and insights from WSJ's global team of reporters and editors A system to process massive amounts of personal data particularly sensitive health information comes with privacy risks saidnnnnnnnnnn      n      Eduardo Ustarannnnn      cohead of the privacy and cybersecurity practice at law firm Hogan Lovells International LLP The success or effectiveness of vaccine passports is about getting data protection right he said The UK government said it will develop digital and paper versions of the certificate but hasnt disclosed details Government agency Innovate UK says it has funded 10 technology companies to develop and test virus certificate systems Some British lawmakers and business groups have criticized the plan arguing that virus certificates would cause discrimination against people who havent received a shot or dont want to share their health data The document published Monday said the government is studying whether to eventually introduce the certificate system more widely in areas such as hospitality Prime Ministernnnnnnnnnn      Boris Johnsonn      nnnn      said last month that pub owners may be allowed to decide if they will require certificates Requiring proof of individuals virus status for attending events or entering buildings within the UK will create a checkpoint society where were asking each other and anyone with authority can ask you about your health data which is obviously some of the most sensitive data we have said Silkie Carlo director of Big Brother Watch a privacy advocacy group based in London In the European Union legislators last month proposed rules for a certificate system to demonstrate the virustest and vaccine status of people moving between the 27 member countries allowing them to travel without additional tests or quarantine restrictions that may be required in the countries they are visiting  Officials have said they want the law known as the Digital Green Certificate to take effect in June The European Commission the EU executive body that drafted the legislation said it will help authorities in member countries develop software to check QR codes on the certificates which travelers will be able to use either in digital or paper form Airlines and tourism industry groups say the EUwide system could encourage travel after a year of lockdowns But questions remain It hasnt been determined whether airlines will handle passengers data when they check the virus certificates and such a requirement would make companies responsible if information is mishandled said Agns Leroux policy director at Airlines for Europe which represents carriers includingnnnnnnnnnnn            International Consolidated Airlines Group SAsnnn      British Airways and Deutschennnnnnnnnnn            Lufthansa AGnnn       Any mistake any data that would leak or be misused can then create fines It would also mean close scrutiny from data privacy authorities at national level on airlines Ms Leroux said Authorities operating the EU certificate system should define how long they will keep personal data and how long the certificates will be valid European privacy regulators said in an opinion paper published this week They also warned against setting up a centralized database to store Europeans health data Under privacy laws in the UK and the EU any application or tool that collects sensitive health data will have to be reassessed if authorities want to expand their use beyond the purposes they initially propose such as for people attending large gatherings or international travel Mr Ustaran said The law requires companies and organizations that collect personal data to make sure individuals give permission for their information to be used for a certain purpose and to obtain permission again if their data will be used for any additional application The UK which left the EU last year still applies the blocs General Data Protection Regulation In addition Mr Ustaran said that operators of coronavirus certificates would need to delete data when it is no longer valid depending on how long immunity and vaccine protection lastswhich scientists still dont know The GDPR requires companies to keep the minimal amount of data necessary and delete information they no longer need As well as privacy concerns critics have raised questions about the practicality of vaccinecertificate systems One issue is whether people will be able to prove they are vaccinated immune or have tested negative for the virusnnnnnnnnnn      n      Emma McClarkinnnnn      chief executive of the British Beer  Pub Association noted that pub workers nearly half of whom are under 25 years old largely havent been vaccinated Adam Brooks the proprietor of two pubs in Essex England estimates that hiring someone to check vaccine certificates at the door would cost him between 800 and 1000 a week or roughly 1100 to 1375 This logistically would be impossible for pubs restaurants and cafes to implement because wed have to have someone at the front door from open to close he said Plus people who are turned away because they lack the proper certificate or didnt receive a vaccine could become aggressive toward pub employees said Mr Brooks
